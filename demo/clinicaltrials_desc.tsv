Pulmonary Vein Isolation With Versus Without Continued Antiarrhythmic Drugs in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation In the POWDER 1 study, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergoing conventional contact force (CF)-guided PVI were investigated. Patients were randomized between continuing previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT) or stopping ADT at the end of the blanking period. This trial, showed an added value of ADT after ablation (in support of 'hybrid rhythm control' as an alternative treatment strategy for AF in some patients).  In the POWDER 2 trial, an analogue study in persistent AF patients will be performed. All patients will undergo ablation index (AI)- and IL distance (ILD)-guided PVI (just like in VISTAX trial) and continue previously ineffective ADT during the blanking period. 'PVI only' was chosen as the ablation strategy according to the STAR AF trial findings.

Physical Activity Intervention for Youth With Anxiety and Depression -Confident, Active and Happy Youth Prevalence of mental health problems and disorders in children and adolescents (hereafter youths) are estimated at 13.4% of which anxiety and depressive disorders account for more than half of these disorders. These rates are increasing, putting a large strain on child and adolescent mental healthcare services (CAMHS) to provide cost-effective treatments with documented long-term effects. However, even when provided the best evidence based treatment, between 40-50 % do not recover and continue to report significant symptom burdens. Thus, there is an immediate need for supplementary and/or new treatment approaches. Physical activity as a supplementary treatment may be one such approach. However, research investigating this approach within this population is scant. This protocol paper describes the development and feasibility trial of a physical activity based intervention targeting anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth.  The current study will be based on the UK Medical Council Research Framework (MRC) for developing and evaluating complex interventions. The study will initially focus on the first two phases of the MRC framework. In line with phase one of this framework, key intervention components have been identified in preliminary work, which draw on the effects of moderate to vigorous physical activity, inhibitory learning theory and self determination theory. These components are to be developed into an intervention to be used in CAMHS. Twenty youths with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will be recruited to the intervention. Physical activity will be measured using the Actigraph GT3X+ monitor at baseline and post-intervention. Outcome measures concerning symptom change will be assessed (anxiety and depression). Semi-structured qualitative interview with participants, caregivers and referring specialists will help identify possible contextual and practical factors associated with delivery of the intervention and explore acceptability of assessment procedures, the intervention, and perceived benefits and barriers to participation.  This study will contribute to the development of evidence-based, patient-informed supplementary physical treatment interventions for youth with internalizing disorders in contact with CAMHS. The goal is to examine new avenues of treatment that ultimately may improve upon current treatment outcomes of these disorders.

Tissue Procurement and Natural History Study of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (NENs) Including Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC) Background:  Neuroendocrine neoplasm (NENs)are rare cancers arising from the neuroendocrine cells and can affect almost any part of the body. They vary from low grade neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) to high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). These tumors often occur in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, lungs, adrenal medulla (pheochromocytomas) or adrenal cortex (adrenocortical cancer) and other areas of the body mentioned below:  * Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET): stomach, duodenum, pancreas, colon, appendix, etc. * Liver and gallbladder * Adrenal tumors * Pituitary gland * Thyroid gland: medullary thyroid carcinoma * Parathyroid tumors * Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors: typical and atypical carcinoid, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) * Extrapulmonary small cell cancer * Peripheral nervous system tumors: paraganglioma, neuroblastoma) * Breast and genitourinary tract  Their rates are rising in the United States and worldwide. Researchers want to learn more about NENs through this natural history study.  Objective:  To study the natural history of people with NENs and obtain samples from them to learn more about the disease. The clinical management of all NETs is not standardized, with only a few FDA-approved therapies and we would like to learn which combination therapeutic approach should be used, how long treatment should be continued, and in what subgroup of NENs a particular treatment option should be used.  Eligibility:  People aged 18 and older who have or are suspected to have NENs or ACC.  Design:  Participants will be screened with a medical history.  Participants will have a physical exam. Their symptoms and their ability to perform their normal activities will be reviewed. They will have blood and urine tests.  Participants will receive recommendations for managing their disease and potential treatment options. They will be able to ask as many questions as they would like.  Participants may provide saliva, blood, and stool samples for research. They will give tumor samples from a previous surgery or biopsy.  Participants may have optional biopsies. During biopsies, cancer tissue will be obtained using a needle and syringe. Tissue will be taken from the liver, lung, or a lymph node. Participants may have an imaging scan or ultrasound to help locate the tumor or area to be biopsied. They will receive local anesthesia and may be sedated.  Participants will complete a questionnaire about their family medical history.  Participants will have follow-up visits every 6 months. They will have physical exams and give samples. If their health changes, they may have extra visits. If they cannot visit NIH, they (or their doctor) will be contacted by phone or email.  Participants will take part in the study for all their life.

Adolescent Impact: A Behavioral Intervention for Adolescents Living With HIV/AIDS The primary objective of Adolescent Impact is to develop and evaluate a developmentally targeted intervention designed to minimize secondary transmission risk behavior and enhance adherence to care and treatment. The intervention is delivered in 12 sessions (five one-to-one, 7 group) over a 3 month period of time. Intervention is delivered in addition to standard of care treatment at the participant's respective clinic. Participants are randomized to either an intervention or control arm; the control group receives standard of care treatment and control group participants are offered the Adolescent Impact intervention following the completion of the nine-month follow up. It is hypothesized that compared to control group participants, intervention group participants will evidence (1) improved or stable virologic and/or immunologic status, mediated by (a) adherence to prescribed antiretroviral medication and/or (b) adherence to HIV care appointments, and (2) reduction/minimization of secondary transmission risk behaviors to include (a) unprotected sex and/or needle sharing, and (b) sexual and drug use behaviors that increase risk for unprotected sex.
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Study to Evaluate Biodistribution of [11C]-GSK2256098 in Healthy Subjects and Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Patients Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a focal adhesion-associated protein kinase involved in cellular adhesion and spreading processes which leads to stiffening and thickening of blood vessels in lungs. This further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow. This study aims to demonstrate biodistribution of FAK inhibitor, GSK2256098, in cardiopulmonary sites i.e. heart and lung tissues. The uptake of 11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within the lung and / or heart of healthy subjects and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) patients will be assessed using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Based on study results the decision as to whether a follow-on phase 2 trial should be initiated to investigate the therapeutic utility of GSK2256098 in iPAH will be decided. Sufficient number of subjects will be screened (up to 30 days prior to scan) to enrol 12 healthy subjects and 12 PAH patients in the study. Enrolled subjects will receive a microdose of \[11C\]-GSK2256098 on a scanning day which will be followed by the follow-up visit (2-4 weeks post-last dose).

Exemestane and Celecoxib in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer The primary goal of this 5-year study is to determine whether exemestane alone or in combination with celecoxib decreases breast tissue density in healthy postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer. Dense breast tissue seen on mammography has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. The study will also examine the effects of exemestane and celecoxib on bone density, blood hormone levels and quality of life. Exemestane, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating postmenopausal women with breast cancer, lowers the amount of estrogen in the body. Celecoxib, approved for treating arthritis pain and for reducing the number or colon polyps in an inherited syndrome, is an anti-inflammatory drug. Half of the women in the study will receive exemestane alone and half will receive exemestane and celecoxib together.  In December 2004, the arm using exemestane and celecoxib was closed to accrual  Postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for developing invasive breast cancer may be eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with breast cancer risk assessment, medical history and physical examination, blood tests, review of medical records, if needed, breast biopsy, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to assess bone density. For the DEXA scan, the subject lies still on a table for about 30 minutes while the spine and hip are scanned using a small amount of radiation.  Participants take exemestane in pill form once a day for 2 years. They also take calcium and vitamin D pills daily to help protect bone health. They are followed in the clinic during the course of the study to determine the amount of drug taken and any side effects, and for the following tests and procedures:  * Medical evaluation and blood tests at after 1 and 3 months on study drugs * Medical evaluation at 6 months * Breast biopsy at screening and then at 12 months * dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the spine, mammogram and routine blood tests before starting study drugs and then yearly for 5 years.
Optune(NOVOTTF-100A)+ Bevacizumab+ Hypofractionated Stereotactic Irradiation Bevacizumab-Naive Recurrent Glioblastoma (GCC 1344) This protocol is designed to generate and provide preliminary data to determine the safety and activity of combination therapy using tumor treating fields (TTFields; Optune(NovoTTF-100A); Novocure, Haifa, Israel), a novel FDA-approved therapy utilizing alternating electric fields to inhibit tumor cell growth, along with bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, San Francisco, CA), a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, a highly-focal abbreviated course of brain irradiation, in the treatment of patients with bevacizumab-naive recurrent GBM. Each of these individual therapies, and also several combinations in doublets, has already demonstrated safety and efficacy but prospective clinical data for the concurrent combination of all three therapies are lacking.
Targeted Levothyroxine Dosing in Infants With Congenital Hypothyroidism This is a clinical study comparing targeted levothyroxine dosing based on thyroid anatomy as visualized on ultrasound (normal vs. ectopic/sublingual vs. athyreosis) to empiric levothyroxine dosing in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. Patients enrolled in the study for targeted dosing will be compared to controls obtained by retrospective chart review. The main outcome is to determine if there is a difference in the frequency of over-treatment and under-treatment during the first 6 months of therapy.
A Study of Three Drugs Plus Zidovudine in the Prevention of Infections in HIV-Infected Patients To evaluate and compare 3 anti-pneumocystis regimens plus zidovudine (AZT) in persons with HIV infection and T4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3. All persons completing at least 8 weeks of therapy on 081 will be offered the opportunity to participate in the nested study (ACTG 981) of systemic antifungal therapy (fluconazole) versus local therapy (Clotrimazole) for the prevention of serious fungal disease.  Persons with HIV disease who are receiving AZT are at risk for PCP, toxoplasmosis, bacterial pneumonia, and other serious infections. It is therefore important to find drugs that can be given along with AZT to control these infections. Aerosolized pentamidine (PEN) has been shown to be useful in preventing PCP and is expected to lower the 2-year risk of PCP. Both sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) and dapsone probably also provide effective preventive treatment against PCP, and both may be useful in preventing toxoplasmosis and extrapulmonary pneumocystosis.
Efficacy of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Severe Primary Dysmenorrhea Primary Dysmenorrhea (PDM), defined as menstrual pain without discernable organic causes, is inexorably common in adolescent women, about 40-90% of women may suffer from it, and 20% of them can be severe in the context of being refractory to medication, daily function impairment, and having pain of severe degree. Novel therapeutic method is in need for pain alleviation for this particular phenotype. We have previously reported that PDM females may engage motor-cortex based descending pain modulation system in our resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) and thermal pain-activation fMRI studies. Based on the reported analgesic efficacy of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on the motor cortex for various experimental painful conditions and clinical pain disorders, we reason that tDCS can be effective for the severe and medication-refractory PDM patients. This study aim to investigate the analgesic efficacy of tDCS in severe PDMs and to elucidate the dynamic brain neuroplasticity in the context of functional connectivity (FC) of pain matrix after tDCS intervention. We will recruit 30 severe PDMs and randomly allocate them to either real or sham group in a triple-blind manner. rs-fMRI for functional connectivity analysis will be performed before and after the tDCS intervention. The imaging data will be correlated with behavioral and psychological measurements. This is the first study in the literature investigating the tDCS efficacy for severe PDM. The result can promise a new possibility for clinical application.
The Impact of Pediatric Skin Disorders: The "Big" Study This study leverages the availability of a validated series of instruments to measure the effect of highly visible, chronic skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis (AD), on patients 8 years of age and above in causing stigma and psychiatric issues, particularly anxiety and depression.
Nivolumab in Biochemically Recurrent dMMR Prostate Cancer MMR-deficient cancers of any histologic type appear to be very sensitive to PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab, and similar data are also beginning to emerge for nivolumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Among the MMR-deficient cancers, the best antitumor responses are often associated with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H status), higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), and higher predicted neoantigen load. Prevalence estimates of MMR deficiency across solid tumor types range from 1% to 20% depending on the type of malignancy. In prostate cancer, 1-3% of unselected cases harbor MMR deficiency and/or microsatellite instability.  For men who previously received definitive treatment for prostate cancer and subsequently develop detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, the clinical state is known as biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. The current standard of care treatment for patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer is either surveillance or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT has not been shown to provide a survival benefit in this setting, and the decision to initiate ADT will depend on patient preference and perceived risks of the disease. A non-hormonal therapy such as nivolumab would provide an alternative to ADT in patients with biomarker selected (i.e. dMMR, MSI-H, high TMB, or CDK12-altered) biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

Methadone and Medication Abortion Pain has been recognized to be the most common and predictable side effect of medication abortion, causing significant distress associated with the process. Yet there is little known about the appropriate management of pain during this process, with no current evidence based recommendations for optimal analgesic regimens during the first trimester.  The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral methadone for pain control during medication abortion. The current medication regimen used to perform medication abortion is a dose of mifepristone (antiprogesterone) orally, followed by a dose of misoprostol (prostaglandin analogue) 24 to 72 hours later. Patients are prescribed a standard dose of ibuprofen 600-800mg tabs for pain control during the process. The investigators will conduct a non-randomized, pilot study with 25 patients evaluated at the Boston Medical Center family planning clinic at 10 weeks of gestation or less for medication abortion.

Pain Management Protocol for Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating chronic health condition that primarily affects African-Americans. Painful episodes are the most frequent form of morbidity in SCD and the most frequent reason for hospitalization. Cognitive-behavioral interventions for pain management have shown efficacy for improving coping abilities, reducing the amount of medication needed to manage pain, and improving daily functioning during painful episodes. However, difficulties with disseminating and implementing cognitive-behavioral treatments have resulted in almost no use of these techniques in pediatric settings. In South Carolina these difficulties are compounded by social and geographical factors that pose particular challenges. A major issue with implementing quality pain management protocols is the difficulty with providing adequate practice and monitoring of the use of the techniques, particularly given the rural population in South Carolina and transportation difficulties for economically disadvantaged families. Due to a history of under-treating pain in SCD it is also critical that psychological and medical treatments are presented in an integrated manner so that these approaches are viewed as complimentary, not mutually exclusive, approaches to pain management. Finally, we believe the same implementation issues for improving the use of behavioral coping skills are also important for improving adherence to medication protocols for appropriate home-based pain management.  The purpose of this proposal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a pain management protocol that uses portable electronic devices and other technologies to increase the practice of psychosocial pain management techniques, improve adherence to the overall biopsychosocial pain management protocol, and improve the clinician's ability to track progress with fewer office visits. In addition to addressing important dissemination issues, by embedding methods to assess for adherence into the technology it will be possible to continuously evaluate and modify protocol efficacy, resulting in a product that is effective, empirically sound, and flexible. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Those on the waitlist condition will receive the same study procedures after a 2 month wait periods. We anticipate that the intervention will result in better pain management and less impairment in the participants.

MRI Assisted Focal Boost With HDR Monotherapy for Prostate Cancer Patients Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of prostate cancer. In recent years it has become evident that higher doses of radiation are required to optimize disease control. The limiting factor of escalating dose to the prostate is the surrounding normal tissue. Despite advances in escalating radiation therapy, failures still occur in 20-30% of patients most often at the site of the original primary disease. As such there is growing interest in further dose escalating to the area of primary disease burden.The aim of this work is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of an integrated focal boost to whole gland prostate treatment using high dose rate brachytherapy.

A Study of Mesothelin Redirected Autologous T Cells for Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma Pancreatic carcinoma typically has a high recurrence rate and very poor prognosis. Surgery is the best choice for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but for those advanced pancreatic cancer patients，when surgery is not available，chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy or interventional therapy is commonly used in the treatment，but the prolonging survival effect is not obvious. And now, some clinical researchers use CAR-T cells in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma, according to the existing results, therapeutic effects are not as good as expecting. One of the most likely reasons is that they continued to use the intravenous infusing of CART cells to patients, when the T cells into the blood circulation, will result in decreased tumor activity and more potential adverse effects. We believe that a suitable TAA targeted-CAR-T cells will be an effective way to treat cancer, as long as the pathway of the cell infused to the body can not only improve the drug concentration of the tumor site but reduce the potential off-target side effects. In order to achieve this goal, it is probably the best choice to use vascular intervention to mediate CAR-T cells infusion. Mesothelin is a cell-surface antigen implicated in tumor invasion, which is highly expressed in pancreatic carcinoma but low-level expressed in mesothelia. We design a 2nd CART cells targeted with mesothelin, and use vascular intervention mediated CAR-T infusion to patients. We hope deliver anti-mesothelin CART cells locally can reducing the side effects while enhancing the antitumor affect by more CART cells accumulate in tumor sites while less can reach normal mesothelial tissue.

Canadian Anticoagulant Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Registry Advances in mechanical intervention (PCI) and anticoagulation therapy have been the cornerstone of treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. However, the large diversity of approaches to anticoagulation during PCI introduces gaps in knowledge regarding management of cardiac patients. As such, we have initiated a national PCI registry to elucidate anticoagulant choice, dosing strategies, case selection dynamics, and clinical outcomes in the Canadian health care environment.
Metabolism of Nicotine and Cotinine in Pregnant African-American Women This study will provide information regarding the optimal dose and duration of nicotine replacement using the nicotine patch for a smoking cessation study of pregnant African-American women. Previous studies have shown that pregnancy, race and ethnicity can affect the way people metabolize nicotine. The information from this study may help scientists develop ways to help pregnant African-American women quit smoking and not start smoking again after delivery.  African-American women 18-30years of age who are in the second trimester of a healthy pregnancy, who are carrying only one baby and who smoke 10 or more cigarettes a day may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and urine test. They receive counseling to help them quit smoking. Those who cannot quit smoking within 7 to 10 days after receiving counseling may be invited to join the study.  Participants are admitted to a private room in the Pediatric Clinical Research Center at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., for 48 hours, during which time they are not permitted to smoke. After a "wash out" period, a nicotine patch will be applied according to these doses and schedules:  * 21 mg patch for 24 hours * 21 mg patch for 16 hours * 14 mg patch for 24 hours * 14 mg patch for 16 hours  An intravenous (IV) line is placed in the subject's arm and 12 blood samples are drawn through the line at intervals during the 48 hours. Twleve urine and saliva samples are also collected. Blood, urine, and saliva samples are analyzed for nicotine and cotinine (a product of nicotine metabolism) levels, and DNA will be collected studied for genes that are associated with nicotine and cotinine metabolism. Participants are interviewed about their urges to smoke, quality of sleep, etc.
Genetic Biomarkers for the Response to Anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor).Treatment in Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (Wet ARMD) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of blindness in the adult population of the Western World. It affects the macula - the region of the retina most rich in photoreceptors and responsible for central vision. The ethiology of ARMD remains poorly understood. Population-based studies have demonstrated a complex ethiology, with contributions from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.  Two major forms of ARMD are clinically distinguishable: the dry and wet form. The latter represents the more aggressive clinical subgroup, and is characterized by the abnormal growth of new blood vessels (neovascularization) under the macula, thus leading to the accumulation of fluid under the retina, bleeding, progression to fibrosis, and finally loss of central vision.  The pathogenesis of this neovascularization is not fully understood, although the VEGF pathway is well known to be involved in angiogenesis and was implicated in the development of the new vessels under the macula. The VEGFs are the most specific and potent stimulators of the angiogenesis.  Molecules that bind and inactivate the VEGF have been developed for the treatment of ARMD and they are applied in ARMD clinic through intra vitreal injections.The difference seen in response to anti VEGF treatment for ARMD between the patients is suggestive for the presence of factors influencing the effect of the drug. Some of these could be genetic variants within genes involved in ARMD pathogenesis or VEGF pathway. Few associations with markers within genes previously found to be related with the pathogenesis of ARMD have been found. It remains unknown whether variants involved in the anti VEGF treatment response could influence the therapeutic outcome.  The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the association between a panel of selected polymorphic markers in the VEGF pathway and the response to therapy with anti VEGF antibody for ARMD. The hypothesis is that the individual genotype influences the response to the anti VEGF. This can lead to identification of genetic biomarkers allowing treatment individualization and optimization of the visual outcomes.

Effects of Cervical Manipulation and Mobilization on Salivary Cortisol Concentrations Currently, there are many studies about the effects of manual therapy on pain, but there are not enough studies to know what are the mechanisms that cause these effects.  Although there is a research measuring neuromodulators substances after a cervical and dorsal manipulation, it has been done in healthy subjects and there is no information about mobilization. This work aims to select a sample with chronic neck pain, incorporating the cervical mobilization as a therapeutic approach to compare the effects of both techniques because not all patients accept the manipulation as a treatment technique (mobilization is much better tolerated) and to verify that the liberation of cortisol is not just caused by the stress on the joint manipulation and the psychological stress and expectation may be important.  The hypothesis of this paper is that cervical manipulation and mobilization in subjects with chronic neck pain there will increase salivary cortisol levels.  It is also expected a little increase in the expectation of being manipulated group because of the psychological stress.  It is expected an improvement in the neck disability, pain and range of motion in the intervention groups immediately after and in the three groups the following week after the exercise.  The main objective of the study is to measure and analyze changes in salivary cortisol concentrations after the intervention in the three groups. Secondary objectives is to analyze the changes in range of motion and disability caused by neck pain neck pain level

Screening of Sleep Apnea by Holter Electrocardiography: Validation of Heart Rate Variability Analysis Algorithm Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a growing health concern affecting up to 60 % of population with cardiovascular disease. Despite the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome, the substantial inconvenience and cost of polysomnography recordings may delay routine evaluation. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for diagnosis. However, this is a costly and time-consuming examination. Sympathoadrenergic balance obtained from the routine Holter monitoring suggesting the presence of OSAS, can enable patients to be guided and their PSGs to be primarily held.Abnormalities in nocturnal cyclical heart rate (HR) variations have previously been described in sleep-related breathing disorders. Compared with PSG, holter electrocardiogram has the advantages of pervasion, lower cost, no need for overnight hospitalization, greater similarity to normal conditions, and good compliance. The observation of changes in heart rate associated with apneic events has a potential to be used as an alternative technique for identification of subjects with OSAS. In regard to the feasibility of screening OSAS by HRV analysis by holter electrocardiogram monitoring, it has already been reported that a 24-h electrocardiographic monitoring might be useful to diagnose OSAS. It became a more feasible technique to use following the development of a convenient recorder for OSAS screening by analyzing changes in heart rate.
Sonocloud-9 in Association With Carboplatin Versus Standard-of-Care Chemotherapies (CCNU or TMZ) in Recurrent GBM The brain is protected from any toxic or inflammatory molecule by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This physical barrier is located at the level of the blood vessel walls. Because of these barrier properties, the blood vessels are also impermeable to the passage of therapeutic molecules from the blood to the brain. The development of effective treatments against glioblastoma is thus limited due to the BBB that prevents most drugs injected in the bloodstream from getting into brain tissue where the tumour is seated. The SonoCloud-9 (SC9) is an investigational device using ultrasound technology and specially developed to open the BBB in the area of and surrounding the tumour. The transient opening of the BBB allows more drugs to reach the brain tumour tissue. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy that is approved to treat different cancer types alone or in combination with other drugs, and has been used in the treatment of glioblastoma. Despite its proven efficacy in the laboratory on glioblastoma cells, carboplatin does not readily cross the BBB in humans. A clinical trial has shown that in combination with the SonoCloud-9, more carboplatin can reach the brain tumour tissue. The objective of the proposed trial is to show that the association - carboplatin with the SonoCloud-9 - will increase efficacy of the drug in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

Role of Nitric Oxide in Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow Regulation During Isometric Exercise in Healthy Humans Autoregulation is defined as the ability of a vascular bed to adapt its vascular resistance to changes in perfusion pressure. In the eye, several studies have reported that retinal blood flow is autoregulated over a wide range of ocular perfusion pressures. The investigators recently showed that nitric oxide (NO) is a key metabolite in the regulation of vascular tone in the eye and plays an important role in the blood flow autoregulation of the choroidal circulation. However, no data is yet available for the optic nerve head. Thus, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that NO plays also a role in optic nerve head blood flow autoregulation. Therefore, subjects will perform squatting to increase systemic perfusion pressure during administration of either a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NMMA), an α-receptor agonist (phenylephrine) or placebo. Optic nerve head blood flow will be continuously measured during the procedure to investigate optic nerve head autoregulation.
The Use of Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Abdominal Aortic Surgery The aim of the present study is the evaluation of cardiovascular biomarkers in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) or abdominal aortic occlusive disease AOD) undergoing open (OR) or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) with regards to short- and long-term outcome.  By blood collection and measurement of the serum biomarkers Copeptin, N-terminal- pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), high sensitive Troponin T (hs-cTnT) and C-reactive Protein (CRP) we expect an improvement of patients stratification by assessment of cardiac stress tolerance. Data gathered may help to simplify the decision whether an open or endovascular approach for abdominal aortic repair (OR and EVAR) should be performed.  Study Hypothesis:  The evaluation of the predictive value of cardiovascular biomarkers (Copeptin, NT-proBNP, hsTnT, cTnI, CRP) improve patient stratification and selection of surgical treatment.

Pediatric Preventative Health Screenings - Obesity and Family-Centered Outcomes In 2012, an Expert Panel of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute published guidelines on cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children; among these guidelines were screening recommendations for obesity and obesity-related conditions. Following publication of this report there was a call for caution and for increased patient (parent, child) input on implementing these guidelines. There are limited current studies evaluating patient-centered outcomes (PCO) in the well-child setting, however, given the childhood obesity epidemic, there is a clear need for such an evaluation. The city of Detroit, MI ranks first among 22 cities with data for the prevalence of overweight and obese youth (39.7%), making Henry Ford Health System, which is located in Detroit, MI, an ideal setting to study childhood obesity related research questions.
Mechanical Properties and Clinical Efficacy of Two Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) Archwires Objective: to compare the changes of the mechanical properties measured by tensile test and three point bending test of two NiTi archwires (heat-activated and superelastic); when exposed to the oral conditions during the first three months of orthodontic treatment and to evaluated their clinical efficacy in lower arch crowding resolution in the anterior mandibular arch.  Methods: Randomized clinical trial in 54 orthodontic patients with moderate crowding. They are going to be randomly assigned in to two intervention groups, each group with 27 patients. One group are going to be treated with heat-activated NiTi archwires and the other group with superelastic NiTi archwires. The patients are going to be followed up for three months and cast models will be taken every month. Measures of anterior lower arch crowding resolution are going to be taken by previously-calibrated operators. Six archwires of each group will be chosen at random and will have tensile test and three-point bending test and the mechanical properties are going to measure before and after its clinical use. The outcomes are going to be determined and compared between groups, with correspondent statistical test and the results are going to be analyzed.

Retreatment Protocol for BL22 Immunotherapy in Relapsed or Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia BL22 is a type of protein that scientists have created to interact with certain cancer cells. Experiments have shown that BL22 can bind with cancer cells that have a particular kind of protein (called CD22 ) on their surface, and can kill those cells. CD22 is present on certain types of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cancer cells, and researchers have been working on treatments that will use BL22 and other related proteins to interact with and kill these kinds of cancer cells. The primary purpose of this study will be to provide access to and treatment with BL22 for patients who have HCL in order to determine their response to the treatment. In addition, the study will assess potential side effects of BL22 and examine why some patients respond better than others to treatment with BL22 and related therapies.  This study will include about 21 to 25 adults who have been diagnosed with forms of HCL that have not responded well to standard treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. These adults also will have received anti-CD22 therapies before, potentially including treatments with BL22, and have not developed immunity or resistance to these treatments.  Prior to the study, patients will undergo a 1- to 2-week screening period to assess their eligibility for treatment. Eligible patients will participate in the study for up to 16 cycles of treatment, with each cycle lasting approximately 4 weeks. For each cycle, patients will receive 1 prescribed dose of BL22 every other day for a total of 3 doses per cycle, and will be assessed after every cycle to evaluate the success of the treatment. During the evaluation visits, patients will be required to have a brief physical examination, give blood and urine samples for testing, and undergo other tests as need to check heart and kidney function and assess the state of the leukemia. Patients who agree will give additional blood, urine, or bone marrow samples for future research purposes.

Brain Imaging to Predict Toxicity in Elderly Patients After Radiotherapy The investigators' aim with the BRITER study is to produce a way of predicting who might be more or less likely to suffer side effects from radiotherapy prior to starting treatment for a glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain tumour.  GBM is the commonest primary malignant brain tumour. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or best supportive care. The focus should be on maintaining a good quality of life for as long as possible.  Radiotherapy to the brain is an effective treatment, however it can produce side effects. The degree of side effects different patients experience can vary widely. It has been thought that if the patient's underlying normal brain is fragile due to an underlying mild dementia or problems associated with high blood pressure or cholesterol then this might make them more vulnerable to radiotherapy.  MRI scans can be used to assess whether there are changes in the normal brain. The BRITER study aims to use MRI scans to see whether the investigators can predict those patients who might be more at risk of side effects from radiotherapy. The trial is aimed at patients aged \> 65 who have been newly diagnosed with a GBM and are going to receive radiotherapy. Patients who agree to take part in the trial will have had an MRI scan as part of their normal diagnosis. Participants will undertake some questionnaires before starting their radiotherapy which will aim to assess their quality of life and their mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning (called cognitive function). Participants may also need an extra MRI scan.  Participants will repeat these questionnaires 4 and 8 weeks after treatment when they come for their follow up appointments. The investigators will compare them to measurements made on the pre-treatment MRI scan.  Participation in the study does not change the treatment the patient receives.  The investigators hope that the BRITER study will enable them to predict the degree of side effects a patient is likely to experience before embarking on radiotherapy treatment. This will enable more informative, individualised discussions surrounding the best treatment path for older patients with a GBM.
Caudal Block and Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in Pediatric Inguinal Hernia Repair Pediatric inguinal hernia repair (IHR) candidates experiences ordinarily mild to moderate pain, rarely severe pain in the postoperative period. Caudal epidural block (CEB) and transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) are two effective postoperative analgesia options. In this randomized study, it is aimed to compare the effects of CEB and TAPB on postoperative pain scores, additional analgesic requirement, postoperative nausea and vomiting incidence, procedural complications, family and surgeon satisfaction, length of hospital stay, chronic pain development in pediatric bilateral open IHR.
Anisodine Hydrobromide For The Preventive Treatment Of Episodic Migraine In this study,288 adult migraine patients aged 18-65 years (diagnosed with migraine without aura and/or migraine with aura, with at least a 1-year history)will be collected to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Anisodine Hydrobromide in preventing migraine attacks in episodic migraine in adults.
High Intensity Interval Training and Technologies in COPD Trials in COPD have shown that HIIT leads to the same positive outcomes as constant load training but causes less breathlessness and leg discomfort during training. However, HIIT protocols in existing trials have all been different and use relatively long interval durations (30 s) and short rests. This is sub-optimal because long interval durations lead to greater breathlessness and patients may fear that they will not fully recover during short rests, potentially decreasing adherence. A novel HIIT protocol involving very brief intervals (e.g. 10 s) with longer rests may provide the same benefits with less distress due to breathlessness.
Pneumocystis Jerovici Pneumonia in Infants and Steroids This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of adjuvant corticosteroids in clinically diagnosed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in infants.
Preventing Tobacco Relapse With Omega-3s Trial Almost 12% of women report smoking during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes and up to 35-75% of women quit smoking during their pregnancy. Clinical trials of tobacco cessation medications have reported safety concerns along with limited efficacy. Subsequently, these medications are not generally recommended in pregnancy and most women who stop smoking do so unassisted. Not surprisingly, the rates of smoking relapse in the post-partum period are up to 67%. To date, clinical trials of behavior interventions in the post-partum period have been largely null. Pharmacotherapy has not been studied as a means of preventing relapse in smokers who quit without the use of medications. Additionally, these medications are excreted in breast milk, which limits there use for lactating women. Thus alternative, safe, and effective strategies to prevent smoking relapse in high-risk, former smokers during the post-partum period are needed.  n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) have anti-inflammatory properties and appear effective as adjuvant therapy for depression. In animal models, n-3 LCPUFA deficiencies can result in hypofunctioning of the dopamine mesocorticolimbic pathways which are related to reward and dependence. Nicotine results in an elevation of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens which is associated with the pleasurable sensations related to nicotine use. It has been hypothesized that correcting the hypofunctioning dopaminergic system through n-3 LCPUFA supplementation might reduce nicotine cravings. Taken together, these studies suggest that supplemental n-3 LCPUFA might be useful in preventing smoking relapse.  The investigators' hypothesis is that post-partum former smokers randomized to n-3 LCPUFA supplementation will be less likely to relapse and have less nicotine cravings compared to women allocated to placebo. To test this hypothesis they will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study of 4 grams/day n-3 LCPUFA supplementation versus placebo. Participants will be enrolled prior to hospital discharge. The primary outcomes of the trial will be time to smoking relapse and change in self-reported nicotine cravings. The secondary outcome will be point prevalence abstinence at 6- and 12-weeks. compliance will be monitored by measuring red blood cell phospholipid fatty acid content and verify smoking cessation through end-expired CO and cotinine.
Primary Aesthetic Breast Augmentation: Comparative Study Between Breast Implants and Autograft of Adipose Tissue The use of autograft of adipose tissue for aesthetic breast augmentation is increasing year after year. According to the latest meta-analysis of 2016, autograft of adipose tissue in augmentation mastoplasty seems to be a promising method with a satisfactory resorption volume and patient and surgeon satisfaction. However, this technique allows for small to moderate breast augmentation and is therefore not suitable for patients wanting a significant increase.  Breast prostheses allow a significant increase. Numerous studies have shown an improvement in patient satisfaction and quality of life assessed using the BREAST-Q questionnaire.  On the other hand, very few studies have objectively evaluated the satisfaction of patients who have benefited from an autograft of adipose tissue as part of aesthetic breast augmentation. No study has yet compared the satisfaction of patients who have benefited from breast implants or lipofilling.  The aim of this study is to compare the satisfaction of patients who have benefited from breast augmentation by prosthesis or by lipofilling using a remote satisfaction interview.
An Open-label, Long-term Extension Study With Filgotinib in Active Psoriatic Arthritis. This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single arm, Long Term Extension (LTE) safety, tolerability and efficacy study of filgotinib in subjects with moderately to severely active PsA. It is estimated that approximately 105 subjects will be rolled-over after they have completed the 16 weeks of double-blind treatment in core study GLPG0634-CL-224. Subjects will be administered filgotinib in this study until filgotinib is registered for PsA or until Week 304, whichever occurs first. The LTE study is concluded with a follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after the last intake of study treatment.

Biodentine Partial Pulpotomy of Pulpally Exposed Primary Molars Objective: To compare success rates of biodentine partial pulpotomy versus formocresol pulpotomy treatment of pulpally exposed lower primary molars.  After caries removal resulted in a pulp exposure, the pulp at the exposed area is amputated to a depth of 2 mm. The wound surface is irrigated and dried. After homeostasis is obtained, an assistant drew lots to randomly allocate the case to either the biodentine partial pulpotomy (PP) or the formocresol pulpotomy (FP) group.  The follow-up for clinical and radiographic evaluation will be carried out at 6-month intervals.
Effect of the Menstrual Cycle on the Symptoms of Depression and Treatment Response Objectives: This prospective investigation will compare premenopausal, perimenopausal and postmenopausal women's response to antidepressant medication. The effects of the menstrual cycle on the symptoms of depression and antidepressant response will also be examined.  Hypotheses: Premenopausal women will show a significantly better response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) than peri- or postmenopausal women. Premenopausal women during lower estrogen phases of the menstrual cycle will complain of increased depressive symptoms despite treatment. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with irregular periods and generally low estrogen levels will show less symptom variability over time.  Method  Subjects: Eighty-four women (28 premenopausal, 28 perimenopausal, 28 postmenopausal) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder will be enrolled in the study.  Procedure: All the subjects will be followed prospectively for 12 weeks and through 2 menstrual cycles while receiving treatment with a standard SSRI antidepressant agent. All eligible women will have a structured clinical interview and will complete questionnaires assessing their depressive symptoms. Blood samples will be collected to evaluate for reproductive hormone levels during the late follicular, midluteal and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle for two consecutive cycles. Serum SSRI levels will also be collected at these times. As the women in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal groups either have irregular menstrual cycles or no longer cycle, they will have blood samples drawn at baseline and on 6 other occasions.  Research Implications: As the majority of psychiatric medication is prescribed to women, understanding the interplay between the menstrual cycle and antidepressant medication will ultimately translate into more diverse and improved patient care. The proposed study is one within a developing research program, which will in part be further guided by this study.

THE GIRAFFE Study: Genomic Risk Markers for Atrial Fibrillation Following Extended Cardiac Rhythm Monitoring Our primary hypothesis is that a risk score comprised of approximately 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with atrial fibrillation at the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) level is associated with the development of atrial fibrillation among previously undiagnosed patients at high risk for atrial fibrillation. A current example of these SNPs is shown in Table 1. As a secondary hypothesis, we will test the association between atrial fibrillation diagnosed in this study with a subset of SNPs reported to be associated with atrial fibrillation and with fine-mapping SNPs. We will also test the association between atrial fibrillation of less than and greater than 30 seconds and a panel of approximately 10 SNPs.

Suture vs Staples for Skin Closure After Liver Resection Closure of the skin after liver resection (surgery to remove part of the liver) may be achieved by one of several methods. The standard method at our institution is to use stainless steel staples to adjoin the two sides of skin. Alternatively, a continuous absorbable suture may be used to "sew" the skin together.  The ideal method of closure should be safe, effective, associated with minimal patient discomfort and have a good cosmetic result. At present, there is no scientific evidence to describe which method is most suitable following liver resection.  The primary aims of this study is to investigate which method (subcuticular sutures vs staples) offers the best result in postoperative rate of (1) skin infection, (2) skin dehiscience (separation of skin) and (3) time taken to perform skin closure. In addition, we are interested in which method is best for patient satisfaction and cosmetic appearance and which method is most cost effective.

eMotiph: E-mental Health Solution for Patients With Schizophrenia Although the main objective of current schizophrenia intervention programs is the reduction of symptoms, its rates are around 36%, and recovery rates are 16.5%. Between 30 and 50% of people with schizophrenia obtain little benefit with conventional therapy. They are considered resistant to treatment. Therefore, the development of innovative evidence-based interventions adjunctive to pharmacological and psychological treatment are necessary for improving results in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Studies with digital solutions have shown feasibility, acceptability and even preliminary efficacy data. But no earlier published study has focused on TRS.  The eMOTIPH is an innovative solution addressed to TRS and born from the outcomes of the previous study eMOTIPH Part 1 (study of beliefs, needs, and limitations associated with current intervention in TRS patients).
Lactoferrin Supplementation and Iron Metabolism in Healthy Pregnant Women To assess the effects of a lactoferrin supplemented formula on fetal development , iron metabolism and immunity in healthy pregnant women. One hundred and twenty healthy pregnant women (24\<gestational weeks\<26) are enrolled and randomly assigned to lactoferrin-supplemented formula group (active group) or normal formula group (control group, without lactoferrin supplementation). Subjects allocated in active group consume lactoferrin supplemented formula (85mg lactoferrin per 100g) 3 times a day (81g totally), while those in control group consume formula without lactoferrin supplementation (\<6mg lactoferrin per 100g formula) according to the same schedule. Routine blood test including hemoglobin and serum ferritin, and food frequency questionnaire-based review and 24h\*3 dietary record are performed every 4 weeks during intervention until delivery. Body weight of newborns are recorded after delivery. The differences in iron deficiency anemia morbility of pregnant women and anthropometric measurements of newborns between groups would be analyzed after completion of this study.

Dose-response Effect of Pine Nut Oil as a Dual FFA1 and FFA4 Agonist on Glucose Tolerance in Healthy Humans. Several free fatty acids receptors (FFARs) have been discovered. These have been implicated in metabolic processes and inflammation. Consequently, these receptors have attracted interest as targets for the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Two of these FFARs (FFA1, FFA4), which is activated by specific free fatty acids (FFAs), is expressed on enteroendocrine cells, pancreatic beta-cells and adipocytes. They have been linked to 1) increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and hence the incretin-mediated increase in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and suppression of glucagon secretion, 2) a direct positive effect on GSIS, 3) reduced inflammation and 4) improved insulin sensitivity. These functions and the abundance of fatty acids in food suggest that FFARs can be considered as nutrient sensing regulators of metabolism. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), frequently results in immediate beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and often complete remission of type 2 diabetes. This may in part be explained by increased GLP-1 levels after surgery. It appears that the effect depends on nutrient delivery directly to the lower parts of the small intestine. It is possible that the RYGB effects are partly due to enteroendocrine stimulation of FFA1 and perhaps FFA4 by direct nutrient delivery, i.e. FFA release in the lower intestines. Pinolenic acid from pine nuts has been shown to be a potent dual FFA1/FFA4 agonist.  Based on these findings the investigators have planned a number of human intervention studies in order to investigate 1) the optimal oral formulation of pine nut oil 2) whether it is possible to mimic the beneficial effects observed after RYGB, 2) if it is possible to increase GLP-1 secretion by stimulating FFA1/FFA4 on enteroendocrine cells causing improved GSIS and increased satiety and 3) enhancement of GSIS by directly stimulating FFA1 on beta-cells.

PARTNER II: Improving Patient and Family Centered Care in Advanced Critical Illness This is a stepped wedged randomized controlled trial comparing the PARTNER intervention with usual care in 5 Intensive Care Units. The overarching goal of this research project to ensure patient-centered decisions about the use of intensive treatments for patients with advanced critical illness. In a prior project, the investigators developed the PARTNER program (PAiring Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse-driven Education and OutReach), a 4-facet, team-based intervention that re-engineers how surrogates are supported in ICUs, including: 1) changing care "defaults" to ensure clinician-family meetings within 48 hours of enrollment and frequently thereafter; 2) protocolized, nurse-administered coaching and emotional support of surrogates before and during clinician-family meetings, 3) increased use of palliative care services for patients with a poor prognosis. The investigators propose to begin deployment of the PARTNER II program in the spring of 2015 enrolling 690 surrogate decision makers in 5 ICUs using a stepped wedge design. The investigators expect to achieve the following project goals:  1. To increase the patient-centeredness of end-of-life decisions, and to increase the quality of clinician-family communication. 2. To decrease the psychological burden on family members acting as surrogates. 3. To reduce total health care costs by decreasing the duration of use of burdensome, invasive treatments at the end of life.
SUSY Study (SUture StudY) Comparing Scarring With Polypropylene vs Polyglactin 910 Sutures Entropion is a common condition in which the ageing eyelid becomes lax and rolls inwards, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the surface of the eye. This can cause discomfort, excessive watering and in severe cases inflammation of the surface of the eye which may lead to permanent scarring and impairment of vision.  There are several options for surgical management of entropion. One of the quickest and simplest treatments to turn the eyelid outwards is to have three stitches ('everting sutures') placed into the eyelid. However recurrence of the entropion is common following this procedure alone. A more permanent operation ('definitive surgery') is to shorten and tighten the eyelid ('wedge excision') in addition to the everting sutures. One approach is to perform the everting sutures soon after the patient attends, as this procedure can be done in a clinic or minor operations theatre and provides immediate relief of symptoms, followed by the wedge excision at a later date, when a slot is available in the operating theatre (which has a longer waiting list). These procedures are routinely offered to patients at our hospital.  Different surgeons use different types of stitches to turn the eyelid outwards e.g. polypropylene or polyglactin 910. Currently, there is no consensus as to which stitch causes less inflammation in the eyelid. The aim of this research study is to compare the inflammatory reaction between the two types of stitches. If there is a significant difference, this could provide useful information for surgeons in deciding which stitch is more appropriate for patients, especially those prone to scarring. We will assess the outcome of each type of stitch in terms of objective and clinical assessment of any scars (through questionnaires) and amount of inflammation caused (through examination of the tissue in the lab).
A Drug-Drug Interaction Study of GK Activator (2) and Simvastatin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

Dosing will take place on study days 1, 8 and 15, and there will be a 7-14 day follow-up period after the last dose. The anticipated time on study treatment is \<3 months, and the target sample size is \<100 individuals.
Covid-19 Antibody Responses in Cystic Fibrosis Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF have protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres throughout the United Kingdom. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on, lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.  Associations will be examined between socio-demographic and clinical variables and serologic testing. The investigators will also examine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyse end-points to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung-transplant recipients and pwCF receiving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies. As pwCF receive COVID-19 vaccination the investigators will perform a comparison of the development and progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination SARS-CoV-2 over time.
A Method for Communication With Arabic Patients Suffering From Classic Locked- in Syndrome Aim of the work The aim of this study is to test an Arabic alphabet communication system designed to train physicians to communicate with Arabic-speaking patients with LIS.  Subjects and methods  * Place of study: Department of Neurology at Sohag university hospital * Type of study: clinical trial. * Subjects: Thirty healthy subjects from three different educational levels. Ten subjects have a preparatory education level, ten subjects with a high school education or its equivalent, and ten subjects who have a university education or are still in a university education stage. They will be collected from among patients' relatives and employees of Sohag University Hospital.  Methods of the study: The method shown in the figure No. 1 is the Arabic alphabet (arranged in the traditional order) printed on double-sided cardboard, with one copy facing the person and one facing the doctor.  The code will be in the case of a positive selection (the desired line or letter) by looking up or one blink, but in the case of a negative selection (not the desired line or letter), it will be by looking down or two blinks.  The person will choose the letters of each word and then choose the end of the word and after selecting all the words of the sentence choose the end of the sentence.  After the strategy has been taught to the subject, he or she will be asked to communicate with the physician using this way.

TT-CMV Observational Birth Cohort Study The spread of viruses through transfusions is the cause of serious illness and death in recipients whose immune systems are unable to fight infection. Another group of patients whose immune systems are underdeveloped and can be affected by a particular virus known as cytomegalovirus (CMV) is low birthweight infants (LBWIs). CMV can be spread through the placenta, during the birth process, through breast milk, while in the hospital or while caring for someone carrying the virus as well as through a transfusion, known as transfusion-transmitted (TT-CMV).  The spread of TT-CMV in LBWIs can be curtailed by transfusing blood products that are CMV negative as well as to filter the white cells in blood that carry the virus (leukoreduction). The purpose of this study is to see if the use of these two strategies can lower the spread of CMV through a transfusion. How "safe" the blood actually is through leukoreduction is not known and CMV still occurs in LBWIs. It is not clear whether this approach is optimal or whether additional safety steps are needed to completely prevent TT-CMV. Specific actions that could tell us when virus has reached the blood product or breast milk is to test each of these to determine if virus slipped "unnoticed" and/or when the product was not thoroughly filtered.  In this study, the investigators believe that the use of both prevention strategies will result in a lower rate of TT-CMV, and that the "cause" of TT-CMV may be found in the presence of CMV at the DNA level or by unfiltered white cells that remain in the blood product. Thus, the most significant clinical question that remains to be addressed is whether this double strategy for transfusion safety actually provides a "zero CMV-risk" blood supply or whether further safety measures (DNA testing + 100% leukoreduction) must be used to protect this extremely vulnerable patient group from CMV infection. This birth cohort study will be done with 6 participating NICUs, and will study both CMV positive and negative mothers in order to estimate the rate and pathway of CMV transmission to the LBWI who receives a transfusion. Another study goal is to compare or link any CMV infection by either transfused units where the virus was undetected, or filter failure. If CMV disease occurs, the investigators will be able to describe the course and outcome in LBWIs who develop TT-CMV.
The Effects of Health Education About Human Papilloma Virus and Cervical Cancer Prevention on Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs and Behaviors Aim: To determine the effects of health education about Human Papilloma Virus infection and cervical cancer prevention on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of adolescent girls and their mothers.  Background: To combat with cervical cancer, it is urgent that prevention Human Papilloma Virus related disease all around the world.  Design: A randomized trial with a control group (n=108) and an intervention group (n=108).  Methods: The study was applied between January to June 2019 in the two different adolescent outpatient clinics in Turkey. The outpatient clinics were randomly assigned as intervention and control groups by numbering and opaque and sealed envelopes. Based on the intention-to-treat principle, all participants were analyzed according to the group they were assigned to, regardless of whether they received the intervention or not. In addition to the routine clinical practice, the adolescent girls and their mothers who participated in the intervention group were given health education twice in the first interview and in the fifth week. Follow-up continued for 12 weeks. The adolescent girls and their mothers in the control group received routine clinical practice. The effects of health education were evaluated with Human Papilloma Virus Knowledge Scale and Health Belief Model Scale for Human Papilloma Virus and its Vaccination.  Impact: Human Papilloma Virus vaccine, which has an important place in primary protection from cervical cancer, is expected to provide effective results by facilitating access to vaccine accompanied with health education.

Pantoprazole Prophylaxis Against Delayed CINV for Patients Receiving Breast Cancer Chemotherapy This study explores whether a commonly used medication called Pantoprazole can help prevent delayed nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy for early breast cancer.  Delayed nausea, and occasionally vomiting, can occur after breast cancer chemotherapy, affecting quality of life. A potential cause of these delayed side effects is that the chemotherapy may cause stomach irritation. Pantoprazole is commonly used to treat stomach irritation by reducing stomach acid, which may in turn improve nausea and/or vomiting.  Patients undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy before or after primary surgery will be invited to participate in the study. They will be asked how much nausea or vomiting they have with and without Pantoprazole from Day 2 until 5 after they receive chemotherapy. All participants will still receive all of the usual anti-sickness medications, which are very effective in preventing sickness in the first 24 hours after treatment, but not for delayed symptoms.  Information from the study may lead to a change in practice with patients using Pantoprazole to reduce the risks of delayed nausea and vomiting.
A Randomized Study of Safety and Efficacy of Pazopanib and Gemcitabine in Persistent or Relapsed Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths, and the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in women. While approximately 75% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer will respond to first-line chemotherapy with platinum and paclitaxel, most patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer will experience disease recurrence. Pazopanib is a novel agent has recently been approved for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and preclinical studies suggest it may be effective in other cancers such as ovarian cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of a novel agent, pazopanib, as an adjunct to a standard treatment, gemcitabine, for recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. This is an open label study in which subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 4 cycles of either gemcitabine, or gemcitabine with pazopanib. Gemcitabine will be administered as an IV infusion weekly on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Subjects randomized to receive pazopanib will take 800 mg daily during the 21 day cycle. All subjects will be monitored for toxicity and other indicators of safety (labs, physical exams, vitals) at intervals throughout the treatment cycles. Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years following the conclusion of treatment to evaluate efficacy. The primary endpoints of the study are progression free survival and overall survival, which will be assessed at three years.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:  * Can n-3 PUFA improve mood disorders (depression, anxiety), craving for alcohol, cognitive impairments and sociability disorders ? * Are the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs due to a modification of the gut microbiota and/or the inflammatory status?  Participants will :  * take a supplementation of omega-3 or placebo during 3 months * do a brain MRI * be interviewed for a dietary anamnesis * provide blood, stool and saliva samples * perform psychological tests and neuropsychological tasks  Researchers will compare active comparator (omega-3) with placebo comparator (olive oil) to see if omega-3 can have a beneficial effect on AUD patients.
Microdissection Testicular Sperm Extraction (MicroTESE) and IVF-ICSI Outcome in Non-Obstructive Azoospermia (NOA) We evaluated the application of surgical testicular exploration with the aid of a microscope (MictoTESE) to increase the chances of obtaining sperm in men with impaired sperm production, a condition known as non-obstructive azoospermia.  We also evaluated the outcomes of these couples when the sperm obtained were used in ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) during assisted reproductive technology treatment.  We believe that excellent results may be obtained with the use of the following techniques in the treatment of couples where non-obstructive azoospermia is a significant cause.

THE LASER-AMI STUDY - Excimer Laser Versus Manual Thrombus Aspiration in Acute Myocardial Infarction The occurrence of no-reflow phenomenon after recanalization of the infarct related artery in acute myocardial infarction is described in up to 40% of cases. This event is associated with a worse prognosis at follow up and an unfavourable left ventricular remodelling. Two main pathogenetic mechanisms cause no-reflow: distal embolization, ischemia-reperfusion injury and individual susceptibility. In such a context, Excimer Laser (EL) may play an important role in order to reduce the rate of microvascular obstruction.  Thus, in this randomized study we will assess the effect of EL versus Manual Thrombus Aspiration for ST elevation MI using ST segment resolution on standard 12 leads ECG as primary endpoint of myocardial reperfusion.

Surveillance and Treatment of Prisoners With Hepatitis C The purpose of the study is to assess how feasible it is to treat and prevent the transmission of Hepatitis C in the prison setting to achieve substantial reductions in the incidence and prevalence of Hepatitis C.  It is hypothesised that a rapid scale-up of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) treatment with interferon-free Direct Acting Anti-virals (DAAs) in prison inmates will achieve a \>50% reduction in the incidence of HCV infection over a two year period in the prison setting.
Lifestyle Intervention Feasibility for Arrhythmia and Symptoms With Intermittent Fasting (LIFE AS IF) BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  Two out of three Americans are overweight and obesity is associated with hypertension, sleep apnea, atrial fibrillation. Metabolic syndrome with centripetal obesity is also a precursor to insulin resistance and the development of Type II diabetes mellitus. While multiple strategies for weight reduction are often recommended in physician visits, calculating calories and energy expenditure is often inconvenient and does not promote compliance. Intermittent fasting, or time-restricted eating, is a methods to limit caloric intake by fasting for 16 hours to promote ketosis and suppress insulin secretion. Weight loss and reduction in body fat has been observed with brief periods of intervention as time-restricted eating results in reduction in overall caloric intake. Prospective feasibility studies and randomized comparative trials with intermittent fasting are lacking.  The investigators recommend caloric restriction in all of our patients that suffer from arrhythmias and BMI \>30. However, they have not systematically measured compliance and the efficacy of lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle counseling and weight loss has been shown to decrease the progression and burden of symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Intermittent fasting can result in consistent reductions in body fat and weight without specific lifestyle counseling. The aim of the present observation cohort study is to assess the feasibility of recommending intermittent fasting in an arrhythmia clinic with regard to compliance and efficacy.  The investigators hypothesize that compliance and adherence to a 16/8 intermittent fasting regimen will be \>25% and result in weight loss, compared to the 6 month trend prior to the intervention. This pilot study will serve as the basis to power the first randomized trial comparing intermittent fasting with other types of dietary counseling for arrhythmia outcomes.  OBJECTIVES  To prospectively assess compliance to prescribed intermittent fasting, measured by adherence and change in weight at 6 months.
Duration of Effect of Alipogene Tiparvovec Treatment, Which Was Administered in Other Studies LPL (Lipoprotein Lipase) is an enzyme which plays an important role in the elimination of triglycerides (fat) and the clearance of dietary fat particles known as chylomicrons (CM) in the blood. In patients who have an abnormal LPL gene, the enzyme does not work (total, hereditary LPL deficiency), which results in a large increase in the amount of triglycerides (fats) and chylomicrons in the blood. This increases the risk of inflammation in the pancreas and leads to long term negative effects for bloods vessels (atherosclerosis). Current medications and / or a strict and low fat diet do not sufficiently reduce the level of triglycerides in order to prevent these conditions. To solve this problem, the company, AMT is developing a gene therapy (AMT-011).  In normal healthy individuals, fat particles are rapidly cleared from the circulation following a standard meal. Within approximately 3 hours the highest levels of fat is reached and clearance is achieved within the subsequent 9 hours. In LPLD subjects, the clearance of fat is greatly reduced as a direct consequence of the lack of LPL. During this study, a standard meal with a tracer (3H-palmitate) is given. Since palmitate is incorporated in the dietary fat, this study enabled monitoring of appearance of newly formed dietary fat into- and clearance of these newly formed dietary fats from the circulation, over time.  The principal aim of the study is to verify if the gene therapy (AMT 011) is still effective in the treatment of this condition. Systemic appearance and clearance of new formed dietary fat particles after ingestion of the meal will be determined by measuring the level of tracer at different time points.
Test of a Preventive Effect of a Deodorant Device Against Respiratory Infections This study is to test whether a chlorine dioxide gas-generating device, which releases a low concentration gas of chlorine dioxide in a sustained manner, can protect against respiratory infections in elderly individuals living in nursing homes. Such a device is used as a deodorant for normal domestic purposes. The investigators reasoned that the antiviral and antibacterial properties of chlorine dioxide might lead to a lowering in the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases. The study is designed as a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover multicentre trial involving approximately 1500 subjects.
Vitamin E Pharmacokinetics and Biomarkers in Normal and Obese Women Background:  * Vitamin E is an antioxidant that reduces the damaging effects of oxygen in the body. Most American men (90%) and women (96%) do not get enough vitamin E from their diets; however, the amount of vitamin E needed by the body has been studied only in men, not women. In addition, it is unknown whether another antioxidant, vitamin C, helps vitamin E in protecting the body. Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, how much body fat a person has could affect the amount of vitamin E needed for protection.  Objectives: This study has three arms to examine vitamin E requirements:  * To determine the amount of fat required to get the best vitamin E absorption from a meal. * To determine the amount (i.e., best dose) of vitamin E that must be consumed before it can be measured in the blood. * To examine how vitamin E and vitamin C work together in the body, in conjunction with diet and vitamin supplements.  Eligibility:  * Arms 1 and 2: Women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have a normal weight and body mass index (BMI) of 27 or less. * Arm 3: Women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have a normal weight (BMI 27), who are overweight (BMI \> 27), or who are overweight (BMI \> 27) and have non insulin-dependent diabetes.  Design:  * Arm 1: Five studies, each lasting 1 month with 1 month off between studies (total study = 10 months). Participants will take 500 1,000 mg of vitamin C twice daily for 2 weeks before admission to the clinical center for 1 week. * Study 1: Participants will eat breakfast containing a known amount of fat, after which they will take a vitamin E pill as well as receive an IV injection of vitamin E. Other foods contain only negligible amounts of vitamin E. Blood and urine samples will measure levels of vitamin E and other substances. * Studies 2 5: Outpatient visits will consist of the same tests as in Study 1; however, the amount of fat in the breakfast will range from 0% to 40% in random order. During one of the studies, an adipose tissue biopsy will be collected to determine how much vitamin E is in the tissues. * Arm 2: Five studies, each lasting 1 month with 1 month off between studies (total study = 10 months). Preparation for Arm 2 is the same as in Arm 1. The proportion of fat, muscle, and water in the body will also be measured. * Study 1: Participants will eat breakfast containing 30% fat, after which they will take a vitamin E pill as well as receive an IV injection of vitamin E. Conditions and procedures are the same as in Arm 1. * Studies 2 5: Outpatient visits will consist of the same tests as in Study 1; however, the amount of vitamin E in the breakfast will range from 2 to 30 mg in random order. * Arm 3: Outpatient (2 to 6 weeks) and inpatient studies (4 to 6 weeks). * Outpatient study: Participants will take 500 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily and provide blood and urine samples, as well as an adipose tissue sample. * Inpatient studies: Two vitamin E inpatient studies. Before these begin, participants vitamin C blood levels will be reduced by means of a diet low in vitamin C. Blood tests will determine how quickly vitamin C leaves the body. Once the vitamin C level is reduced, the first vitamin E study will begin.  Study A: The procedure for this study is the same as in Arm 2, Study 1.  Study B: The procedure for this study is the same as in Study A, except that the participants blood vitamin C levels will be higher.
A Randomized, Equivalence Trial of Percutaneous Lumbar Adhesiolysis and Caudal Epidural Steroid Injections The purpose of this study is to:  * evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain in patients without post lumbar surgery syndrome or spinal stenosis and compare with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid injections. * evaluate and compare the adverse event profile in all groups.

Correlation Between Circulating Tumor Cells and Brain Disease Control After Focal Radiotherapy for Metastases of Breast Cancer This study assesses the number of CTCs before and 4-5 weeks after focal stereotactic radiotherapy, in single or fractionated dose, and correlate with the local and distant brain progression-free survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Registry to Evaluate INOmax in Newborn Babies With Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries to the lungs. It is a serious condition. It causes the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs to become hard and narrow. When this happens, the heart has to work harder to pump the blood through.  Some babies are born with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Doctors might use INOmax (a gas the baby breathes) to help newborn babies (neonates) with PH. This study will use information from the records of registered babies to see how effective and safe INOmax is for treating premature and other newborn babies for up to 11 days after they are born.
Ultra-brief Intervention for Problem Drinkers The major objective of this proposal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an ultra-brief, personalized feedback intervention (a pamphlet) for problem drinkers. Subjects will be recruited via a telephone survey which will collect baseline data. The households of half of the subjects will receive the pamphlet as unaddressed ad mail shortly thereafter. Follow-up interviews will be conducted, by telephone, three and six months after the mailing of the pamphlets.  Hypothesis 1: Respondents from households who receive the pamphlet will display significantly improved drinking outcomes at the three-month and six-month follow-ups as compared to respondents from households in the no intervention control condition.  Hypothesis 2: More calls will be received on a help-line listed on the pamphlet (and advertised elsewhere) from residents of households who receive the pamphlet as compared to residents from households who do not receive the pamphlet.  Hypotheses 3 - 6 deal with mediator and moderator hypotheses, exploring the role of perceived risk, perceived drinking norms, and drinking for social reasons.

NET-Works:Community Preschooler Obesity Prevention The goal of the Minnesota center is to integrate primary care, home, and community-based intervention strategies to promote sustained patterns of change in food intake, physical activity, and body weight among low income, ethnically diverse children. A culturally matched family connector will create linkages among the settings to support parents in making home environment and parenting behavior changes conducive to healthy growth and development in their children.  Specific Aim 1 To evaluate the effects of a three-year multi-setting parent-targeted randomized controlled intervention on the primary outcome, child BMI, compared to a standard primary care-only intervention among 500 low income ethnic minority two to four year old children who are at or above the 50th percentile of BMI for age and gender.  Hypothesis 1: Children in the multi-setting parent-targeted intervention will have a lower BMI at 24 and 36 months, compared with children in the standard primary care only control group.  Specific Aim 2 To evaluate the effects of a three-year multi-setting parent-targeted intervention on secondary outcomes, including change in child energy intake and physical activity energy expenditure, compared to a standard primary care-only intervention.  Hypothesis 2: Children in the multi-setting parent-targeted intervention will have lower energy intake and higher energy expenditure over the three-year period, compared with children in the standard primary care-only control group.  Specific Aim 3 To evaluate the effects of the multi-setting parent-targeted intervention on hypothesized mediators of change in dietary intake, physical activity, and BMI.  Hypothesis 3: It is hypothesized that changes in parenting behaviors and the home food and physical activity environment will mediate changes in child energy intake and expenditure, and body mass index (BMI).
The Therapeutic Efficacy of Neurofeedback in Depression The investigators examined the therapeutic efficacy of neurofeedback in depression subjects. The investigators hypothesize that 5 weeks neurofeedback training will be able to alleviate depressive symptoms.
The Effects of Epinephrine in Endotoxemia in Normal Volunteers Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a substance produced by the body (in the adrenal gland) in response to stress such as infection or injury. Endotoxin is a man- made substance, which causes the body to "mimic" sickness (fever, chills, and achiness) for a few hours. This study is designed to give epinephrine before and/or after endotoxin to determine if this medication can prevent or relieve any of the symptoms caused by endotoxin.

Endothelial Leakage and the Association to Endothelial Biomarkers After Surgery The primary aim of this study is to investigate fluid loss from the blood stream (''endothelial leakage'') and the damage on the vessel wall (''endothelial function'') during surgery.  Cardiovascular complications during surgery are said to have different causes, e.g. lack of fluid in the blood stream (''hypovolemia'') and decreased vascular tone. Hypovolemia can have different causes, one being damage to the endothelial function. During trauma and infection, it has been previously shown, that damage to the endothelial function causes fluid loss from the blood stream. Nevertheless, this has never been demonstrated during surgery.  Secondary this study will measure the blood flow using a thermo-camera during surgery. This will together with selected blood tests provide information on various possible causes to hypovolemia.  The purpose of this study is to describe and quantify endothelial damage (assessed by selected endothelial biomarkers) and albumin escape rate as a proxy for endothelial leakage (assessed by measuring radioactive 125-I labeled HSA injected postoperatively), combined with assessment of MTS (assessed by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) and digital thermography). This will allow a detailed description of the surgery's impact on the endothelial integrity and contribute to a better understanding of the physiological changes that occur postoperatively.  The study will investigate patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) and total pancreatectomy. These patients have a vast clinical need, being one of the most extensive abdominal surgical procedures with great stress response.  The study is a prospective exploratory cohort study and methods include blood sampling pre- and post-operatively, 125-I labeled humane serum albumin postoperatively (and preoperatively if logistically possible) and thermography.  The hypothesis of this study is that the extent of endothelial damage measured by selected biomarkers is associated with the level of albumin escape rate after major abdominal surgery. Secondly, inflammation increases albumin escape rate after major abdominal surgery.
Brain Imaging Studies of the Effects of Cocaine Abstinence This study evaluates theories regarding cocaine abstinence which propose that increased presynaptic and postsynaptic dopamine activity and increased serotonin activity are associated with abstinence in cocaine dependent subjects at the beginning and three to six months after a treatment program. We are using positron emission tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in cortical and subcortical areas in a series of brain imaging studies testing these theories of abnormalities in the dopamine and serotonin system for cocaine addiction by examining the distribution of 18F-fallypride, 18F-altanserin, and FDG. We are evaluating genetic theories associated with cocaine addiction through the examination of genetic markers and functional genomics.
Effect of Short Term Ovarian Suppression on Androgen Overproduction in Overweight Girls With Androgen Excess This study will test whether short-term suppression of ovarian function can ameliorate androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight girls with androgen excess. The investigators hypothesize that one dose of depot leuprolide agonist administration will improve androgen levels in girls with ovarian androgen overproduction. Specifically, this intervention will improve androgen levels after ovarian stimulation testing with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG).
Study on Immune Status of Patients With COVID-19 This study is a prospective cohort study aimed to clarify the continuous immune state changes of patients with COVID-19. Investigators include the patients admitted to the hospital within one week after the onset of COVID-19. 10ml of patients' blood was collected day 1, day 7, day 14 , and day 20 after the patients admitted to the hospital. The blood inflammatory factors, immune related molecules, and immune cells were detected to determine the changes of patients' immune status. The impact of immune status changes on prognosis and quality of life in later follow-up period was evaluated by various questionnaires and evaluation scales.
Radiofrequency Ablation of Painful Soft Tissue Neoplasms Radiofrequency ablation is used to treat patients with many different conditions. It is used to treat heart arrhythmia and benign bone tumors, and to control bleeding during surgery. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for soft tissue ablation (removal). The technique involves inserting a probe, guided by computed tomography or ultrasound, and sending radio waves through the probe. The radio waves generate heat, which both destroys adjacent tissue and cauterizes blood vessels.  This study will enroll 15 adults (age 18 or older) with soft tissue metastases who suffer pain that is not well controlled by other means, such as drugs. The goal is to reduce their pain or their use of analgesics by partially destroying some of their tumors.  Patients will be ineligible for the study if they change the class of pain medication they use within 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after the study treatment. Patients will fill out short questionnaires about pain and daily activities (Brief Pain Inventory) before treatment and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months after treatment to ascertain whether their pain is better controlled with less pain medication.  For the treatment, most patients will receive local anesthetic in the area where the probe is inserted. Some patients may require general anesthesia. The probe will remain in place typically for 10 to 30 minutes. For larger tumors, it may be inserted at different positions.
Systemic Adverse Effects After Osteopathic Treatment and Vitamin C The goal of this triple-blind randomized clinical trial is to learn about systemic adverse effects in first visit patients who attend an osteopathic medicine center in Barcelona. The main question it aims to answer are:  • Check if there is a relationship between taking vitamin C and the reduction in the appearance of systemic adverse effects after osteopathic treatment (24-72 hours) First-visit patients, at the end of treatment, are asked to enter the study. If they accept, they are administered 1g. of vitamin C, or 1g. placebo or nothing.  If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare placebo group, control group and intervention group to see if there is a relationship between taking vitamin C and the appearance of systemic adverse effects\].
Brain and Cognitive Changes After Reasoning or Physical Training in Cognitively Normal Seniors Seniors 65 years of age and older represent one of the fastest growing segments of society with the population doubling within the next 25 years with dramatic rates of mental decline, costing society billions of dollars each year. The proposed research seeks to discover whether relatively short term mental or physical training can enhance gist reasoning, generalize to untrained cognitive areas and modify/strengthen brain function in areas susceptible to aging processes. To identify neuroprotective and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent mental decline and maximize cognitive brain health during the course of the adult lifespan has major public policy implications.
Intrathecal Pemetrexed for Recurrent Leptomeningeal Metastases From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer It has been proved that intrathecal chemotherapy is the main treatment strategy for leptomeningeal metastases. At present, the commonly used drugs for intrathecal chemotherapy include methotrexate, cytarabine, and liposomal cytarabine. In recent decades, no new effective drugs have been discovered for intrathecal chemotherapy. The recurrence of leptomeningeal metastases is inevitable even after aggressive treatment. There is no effective treatment for recurrent leptomeningeal metastases after comprehensive treatment which includes intrathecal methotrexate and/or cytarabine, central nervous system radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy as well as tyrosine-kinase inhibitor drugs. The quality of life is extremely poor, and the patients always die in short time. Pemetrexed is a newer multitargeted antifolate which has shown activity in various tumors. It has higher effectiveness and safety, which has been used as the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. In animal studies, pemetrexed was demonstrated to suppress tumor growth completely in mice with two types of transplanted human colon xenografts resistant to methotrexate. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intrathecal pemetrexed in patients with recurrent leptomeningeal metastases from non-small cell lung cancer.

Resistance Exercise in Rheumatic Disease People with rheumatic disease often have decreased strength, muscle mass, and bone mineral density due to repeated bouts of inflammation, normal effects of aging, disuse, and inactivity. The medications used to quell the disease process, such as prednisone, can also have detrimental effects on body composition, strength, and functional capacity. The investigators propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and effects of resistance exercise in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and vasculitis. The unique resistance protocol the investigators propose involves performing movements in a slow and controlled fashion (i.e., no acceleration or use of momentum in the lifting and lowering of the resistance) to minimize force on the joints and connective tissues. This will be conducted in an individually-supervised environment with a new generation of exercise equipment that will accommodate their musculoskeletal capabilities and allow for reproducibility of the exercise protocol. The investigators intend to investigate the feasibility, safety, musculoskeletal, and psychological effects of this resistance exercise protocol in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis by testing their strength, body composition, functional ability, mood, and quality of life before and after this 16-week resistance exercise intervention.

hCAP18 Levels and Vitamin D Deficiency in Healthy Subjects Vitamin D deficiency (low levels of vitamin D in the blood) is a common problem. A recently discovered protein, called hCAP18, likely plays an important role in the immune system and may depend on adequate levels of vitamin D. It is not known what levels of vitamin D are needed to allow the body to make this protein. Nor is it known if giving vitamin D to people who are found to be deficient will help boost levels of hCAP18. This study aims to clarify the relationship between vitamin D levels and hCAP18.

Comparing Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy and Mindfulness Based Self-compassion Therapy in a Psoriasis Sample Increasing research evidence supports the effectiveness of mindfulness based interventions; however, the exact mechanisms of change are poorly understood. Some evidence proposes that self-compassion is an important mechanism of change in the effectiveness of mindfulness based interventions. The current research will evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two mindfulness meditation approaches; Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness based Self-compassion Therapy (MBSCT), for individuals with psoriasis, a skin condition commonly associated with stress. Blood analyses will be conducted to assess and compare the impact of the interventions on the immune system. Self-report questionnaires will explore participants' psychological functioning (e.g. self-compassion, depression, anxiety, worry). This study will also examine whether a relationship exists between immune functioning and psychological factors. An audio-guided MBSCT programme will be piloted, with a view to trialling as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional mindfulness interventions. Findings will enable us to design more effective interventions in the future, and yield clear results regarding the existence of a definite link between immunological functioning and psychological functioning.  The main research hypothesis is that participants who complete a mindfulness based intervention will experience significantly greater psychological well-being, symptom reduction, and greater changes in telomerase and cytokine activity than individuals who only receive treatment as usual for their psoriasis.

Patients With Neck Pain Likely to Benefit From Thoracic Spine Thrust Mobilization Recently a clinical prediction rule (CPR) has been developed that identifies patients with neck pain who are likely to respond rapidly and dramatically to thoracic spine thrust manipulation and an active range of motion exercise. Although the initial predictor variables identified during the development of a thoracic spine manipulation CPR seem to have adequate face validity, there is no guarantee that these factors will persist in a different group of patients, even ones with similar characteristics as those used in the initial exploratory study. The purpose of this follow-up study in which patients will be randomly assigned to receive thoracic spine thrust manipulation followed by therapeutic exercises or therapeutic exercise alone will be to investigate the validity of the previously developed CPR. If the CPR is indeed meaningful, patients who are positive on the CPR and receive thoracic spine thrust manipulation should experience improved outcomes compared to patients who are negative on the CPR and receive thoracic spine manipulation, and compared to patients who are positive on the CPR but receive the intervention believed to be effective for another subgroup of patients with neck pain.

Phase I Study of BYL719 in Combination With Cisplatin and Radiotherapy in Patients With Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer This is a phase 1 study (the first step in testing a new drug or combination, to see how safe the drug and/or combination are) of investigational agent BYL719 in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (LA-SCCHN) in combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy (cisplatin).  BYL719 is a new drug that is able to bind (attach to) and block a protein called PI3K-alpha. PI3K-alpha is part of an important pathway called EGFR/PI3K/Akt. A pathway is a series of chemical reactions among proteins in the cells that are involved in the support of normal cellular function. If the pathway is too active, due to changes in those proteins, the pathway can lead to tumor cell growth, survival and invasion. BYL719 has been shown to stop cancers in laboratory and animal studies.  This study is the first time BYL719 will be combined with radiation and chemotherapy.
Effect of Ursolic Acid Administration on Insulin Sensitivity and Metabolic Syndrome The metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of overweight/obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension and an inflammatory state, which together increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). It is also characterized by a decreased insulin sensitivity, namely, lower ability of insulin to metabolize glucose, key in the physiopathogeny of disease process.  In the search for a pharmacological agent that can attend more components of the metabolic syndrome and above all improve insulin sensitivity to effectively prevent the development of CVD and DM2, ursolic acid is a promising compound.  Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic carboxylic acid present in medicinal herbs, parts of some fruits like apple peel, and plants such as rosemary. There is scientific evidence of important benefits of ursolic acid level in vitro and in vivo on insulin, metabolism of lipids and glucose, as well as on the body weight and metabolic parameters. However, the results are not clear and the mechanisms are not fully elucidate.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ursolic acid on the insulin sensitivity and metabolic syndrome.

Initial Correction Keratoconus Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, progressive disease in which corneal irregularity increases. As the condition develops, more advanced forms of optical correction are needed to improve vision for patients. Until recently, small diameter corneal gas permeable lenses were considered the primary mode of correction for patients with keratoconus. Now, however, practitioners have multiple options for reducing the optical aberrations caused by keratoconus, including scleral lenses. As of yet, no single option for optical correction has been identified as the preferred mode of correction in terms of overall patient satisfaction with vision, comfort, and ease of use. The order in which various forms of optical correction would be most logically introduced has yet to be determined. This is a study comparing small diameter corneal gas permeable and large diameter scleral lenses in individuals with keratoconus.

Use of Cognitive Stimulation Software for Patients Over the Age of 70 Followed for Breast Cancer: COG-TAB-AGE Feasibility Study Numerous studies have shown the impact of anti-cancer treatments on cognition and more particularly that of chemotherapy. Elderly patients also seem to be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment. These disorders can have a particularly negative impact in this population, in particular by having repercussions on the observance of oral treatments or even on autonomy. However, investigators still have little data concerning the management of cognitive disorders induced by oncology treatments, particularly in the elderly patient. It is therefore necessary to offer care adapted to this population which will allow the reduction of the sequelae induced by cancer treatments and the improvement of the quality of life of elderly patients.Although there are no preventive measures yet, recent studies of young women being treated for breast cancer with a cognitive complaint have shown a beneficial effect of cognitive stimulation on these cognitive disorders. Stimulation programs of this type have been developed in electronic format. However, to date, they have not been the subject of specific studies with elderly patients in whom the use of computer interface can be an obstacle.Sponsor propose to set up a study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of using cognitive stimulation software on tablets with elderly patients.The HAPPYNeuron® software, developed by a French team of neurologists, speech-language pathologists and psychiatrists, offers exercises to be performed online to stimulate the cognitive functions most impaired by oncological treatments (memory, attention, executive functions and speed of treatment).For this feasibility study, the sponsor plan to include 50 patients aged 70 and over to have them test the acceptance of cognitive stimulation by this software with a tablet interface.
Effects of Pramlintide on Endogenous Production of Very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL)-Triglyceride and Glucose in the Post Prandial State in T2DM Diabetes affects almost 21 million people in the United States. In this study we will test a drug called Pramlintide(Symlin), and see how it works to lower blood sugar and fat levels after a meal. Lowering high sugar levels and fat levels after a meal is very important in the prevention of the problems that persons with type 2 diabetes often encounter. Hypothesis is that Pramlintide will lower blood sugar and fat levels after a meal.
Preliminary Assessment of the Psycho-emotional State of Patients With TMD TMD (temporomandibular disorders) is the name for a collective syndrome of disorders that includes abnormal function of the muscles of mastication, the temporomandibular joints and surrounding structures. It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.  Nowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject \[4-11\].  The etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the "contractile" activity of the masticatory muscles.  TMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles. Activities such as daytime clenching of the teeth and bruxism, habits of chewing gum, biting lips, finger nails or cheeks are factors that cause significant strain on the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joints.
Prospective Evaluation of Iron Status in Cancer Patients Beginning Chemotherapy In cancerology, anemia is a frequently-found situation, with a prevalence ranging from 30% to 90%, according to the series, disease stages, primary tumor locations and age (Scotte, Launay-Vacher et al. 2012). Although very probably a major cause of anemia, iron deficiency (ID) has been seldom investigated in the field of cancer. Its prevalence and incidence have never been assessed in a prospective study. It is well-known that anemia in the cancer setting is a source of asthenia and deterioration of quality of life, and can even reduce the efficacy of anticancer treatments such as radiotherapy. Correcting anemia therefore constitutes a daily challenge. Before 2004-2005, a very large proportion of patients were treated with erythropoietin (EPO). However, prescriptions for EPO appear to have considerably declined since the warnings issued by various scientific societies and governments on account of the possible increase in death rates and a higher incidence of thromboembolic events, as reported in 8 studies published to date (NCCN 2012). Simultaneously, the transfusion rate augmented from 3.4% to 8.7% and the median hemoglobin level fell from 10.8 to 8.9 g/dL (Feinberg, Bruno et al. 2012). The use of injectable iron appears to have improved the correction of anemia by EPO, as reported in several concordant studies versus oral iron and placebo (Pedrazzoli, Rosti et al. 2009; Steensma, Sloan et al. 2011). However, no monotherapy study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of injectable iron, alone without EPO, for the correction of ID (with or without anemia) in cancer treatment. Consequently, there exists a wide variety of practices, with an injectable iron prescription rate which, a priori, does not match the number of patients with iron deficiency. There exist other iron-based parameters to characterize ID but these are not yet used routinely during chemotherapy and need to be validated in the cancer field.  These parameters include:  * An assay of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (rHC) * An assay of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) Soluble transferrin receptors are mainly located on red blood line cells receiving iron delivered by transferrin.  In this study, we propose to make a prospective assessment of the iron status of cancer patients beginning chemotherapy. The aim is to determine the proportion of patients who might benefit from injectable iron treatment. All ID will be covered prospectively over a 2-year period.
Retrospective Chart Review of the 5 & 2 & 2 and 4 & 2 & 1 Plans The purpose of this study is to retrospectively and systematically review records of overweight and obese Medifast Weight Control Center (MWCC) members who have been assigned to the 5 \& 2 \& 2 Plan or the 4 \& 2 \& 1 Plan for weight loss to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of these programs. The study will describe demographics of this population, along with weight loss, anthropometrics, body composition and effects on available cardiovascular parameters. Adherence to the plans will also be examined.  The study hypothesis is that the 5 \& 2 \& 2 Meal Replacement Plan and the 4 \& 2 \& 1 Meal Replacement Plan are both effective programs for weight loss in overweight and obese adults.
Perioperative Metabolic and Hormonal Aspects in Major Emergency Surgery Emergency laparotomies, which most often is performed due to high risk disease (bowel obstruction, ischemia, perforation, etc.), make up 11 % of surgical procedures in emergency surgical departments, however, give rise to 80 % of all postoperative complications. The 30-day mortality rates in relation to these emergent procedures have been reported between 14-30 %, with even higher numbers for frail and older patients. The specific reasons for these outcomes are not yet known, however, a combination of preexisting comorbidities, acute illness, sepsis, and the surgical stress response that arise during- and after the surgical procedure due to the activation of the immunological and humoral system, is most likely to blame. The complex endocrinological response and consequences of this response to emergency surgery are sparsely reported in the literature.  The aim of this PHASE project is to evaluate and describe the temporal endocrine, endothelial and immunological changes after major emergency abdominal surgery, and to associate these changes with clinical postoperative outcomes.
Cyclobenzaprine Extended Release (ER) for Fibromyalgia Amrix (Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride Extended release capsules) is approved by the FDA as a muscle relaxant, indicated for the treatment of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Cyclobenzaprine ER (Amrix TM) has a distinct pharmacokinetic profile providing early systemic exposure and consistent plasma concentration over several hours. Overall, a single dose of Amrix 30 mg is similar to that of cyclobenzaprine immediate release 10 mg three times daily. This ER formula should improve compliance, with similar efficacy and possibly less side effects as is often the case with slower release formulations.  There are clinical studies showing that cyclobenzaprine can alleviate pain secondary to Fibromyalgia induced muscle tone. This multi-layered evidence base suggests that cyclobenzaprine may be able to alleviate pain in fibromyalgia. Theoretically in fibromyalgia, pain is interpreted centrally and possibly occurs due to said muscle spasm . Cyclobenzaprine may relieve this pain, thus allowing patients to function better during the day and sleep better at night. Cyclobenzaprine has tricyclic antidepressant structure which may also allow pain signal dampening in the spinal cord as well, similar to amitriptyline which is used off-label for neuropathic pain as well.  Fibromyalgia (FM) is an illness that may involve medical, rheumatologic, autoimmune, sleep, endocrine and psychiatric pathology. It is a syndrome of recurrent pain at trigger points. Greater than 90% of these patients will report fatigue as a key symptom as well. There are several investigation lines into the treatment of FM induced pain. Exercise, behavioral therapy, amitryptiline, duloxetine, tramadol, sodium oxybate, pregabalin all have randomized trials and almost all focus on pain. There are very few studies evaluating cyclobenzaprine and none studying to Cyclobenzaprine ER formulation. None evaluate pain reduction, sleep and fatigue improvement.  Cyclobenzaprine is a drug with minimal adverse effects (dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, somnolence, nausea, and dyspepsia). It may have a safer tolerability profile than some of the FM medications noted above. As cyclobenzaprine is often studied and often added as an augmentation agent to patients' regimens who suffer from acute painful musculoskeletal conditions, the authors feel that cyclobenzaprine would also be effective in this population. The authors wish to conduct a study to determine if cyclobenzaprine ER is safe and tolerable in the treatment of FM induced pain, and secondary fatigue and insomnia. This initial study may allow for continued regulatory studies with this product in FM subjects. The authors propose a double-blind placebo controlled study to determine if cyclobenzaprine ER is safe and effective in reversing FM induced pain, and secondary fatigue and insomnia.

Comparing EEG Patterns in Different Age Groups During General Anesthesia With Sevoflurane This study is being conducted to evaluate and assess the electroencephalography wave patterns in different age patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. The aim of our study is to compare the raw EEG waves in different age patients and analyze any changes in these patterns among various age groups and which of these groups will have the EEG signal of high-frequency waves or low frequency waves. Previous studies have shown that light sedation is often accompanied by decreasing posterior alpha waves and increasing the intensity of frontal/central beta waves. It is therefore of neuroscientific interest to assess whether the electroencephalographic correlates of sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness have different or similar frequency range among the age groups.

Life Story Book for Older Adults and live-in Migrant Caregivers The relationship between older adults and live-in migrant caregivers is always challenged by weak emotional connectedness, ineffective communication, power struggling and unmet needs of both, that may lead to poor care quality and negatively influence their well-being. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility to train live-in migrant caregivers to adopt Life Story Work for promoting the dyadic relationship with the older adults, through communication and negotiation, mutual understanding and expression of needs. This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial. The caregivers of the intervention group will receive training on life story work. Then they will be asked to create a life storybook of the older adult at home individually, with the support from the team. The caregivers in the control group will receive training on communication skills only, and will be asked to conduct social activities at home. Outcomes such as quality of relationship; well-being, depressive symptoms and level of loneliness of the older adults; and job satisfaction of the caregivers will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 3 months follow up. Focus group interviews will be conducted with the caregivers of the intervention group for soliciting their comments regarding to the intervention.
Childhood Allergy and the Neonatal Environment The purpose of this research study is to study the relationship between childhood asthma, allergies, and early-life environmental factors that may cause childhood asthma and allergies. Previous birth cohort studies have found early-life environmental factors such as allergies, pollutants, viruses and bacteria have all contributed to the development of asthma and allergies. Investigators are doing this research because there continues to be a strong need to understand the root causes of asthma and allergies. The CANOE study is an observational cohort study, which means investigators are not asking participants or participant's child to change their medications and investigators will not be giving participants or participant's child a study drug.

Pulmonary and Ventilatory Effects of Trigger Modulation in Intubated ICU Pressure support ventilation allows intubated ICU patients to breathe spontaneously. Among specific settings, the adjustment of the trigger value (or threshold for triggering the ventilator) has not been explored to date. The trigger threshold corresponds to the sensitivity of the ventilator to detect patient's inspiratory effort and then deliver the predefined pressure support to inflate the lungs and deliver a tidal volume. The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of trigger level on pulmonary and ventilatory physio (-patho)logical parameters in spontaneously breathing ICU patients.
Intracoronary Injection of Epo After Myocardial Infarct "Intra-CO-EpoMI" Primary endpoint: Is intracoronary injection of a single dose of darbepoetin alpha, during reperfusion in patients hospitalized for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), able to reduce infarct size ?  In in vivo studies, many experiments evidenced infarct size reduction, due to anti-apoptotic compounds, when given during reperfusion, after cardiac ischemia. In humans, post-conditioning offers such a protection, as the investigators have previously showed (Staat P et al. Post-conditioning the human heart. Circulation. 2005 112(14):2143-8).  Infarct size reduction could lead to a reduced rate of complications (heart failure, rhythmic complications) and finally, morbidity and even mortality. This protection depends on anti-apoptotic properties (Zhao ZQ et al. Inhibition of myocardial injury by ischemic postconditioning during reperfusion: comparison with ischemic preconditioning. Am J Physiology Heart Circ Physiology 2003 Aug; 285(2):H579-88). Many drugs have been proposed to be able to mimic this phenomenon. Among them, many are efficient but toxic in vivo or difficult to manage (insulin, morphin). One of the most promising agent could then be erythropoietin (EPO) (Opie LH et al. Postconditioning for protection of the infarcting heart. Lancet. 2006; 367(9509):456-8). In order to target ischemia-reperfusion injuries, EPO impact is better and better demonstrated (e.g.: Mudalagiri NR. Erythropoietin protects the human myocardium against hypoxia and reoxygenation injury via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and ERK1-2 activation. Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Oct 22). The purpose of the study is to test this hypothesis in humans, on the onset of the reperfusion, after myocardial ischemia (acute myocardial infarct). EPO could contribute to protect myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury. This impact could rely on anti-apoptotic properties.

18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography in Oncology Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from radiolabelled tracer molecules. These radiotracers allow biologic processes to be measured and whole body images to be obtained which demonstrates sites of radiotracer accumulation. The most common radiotracer in use today is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) which is a radiolabelled sugar (glucose) molecule. Imaging with 18F-FDG PET is used to determine sites of abnormal glucose metabolism and can be used to characterize and localize many types of tumours.  Cancer treatment and outcome depend largely on the accurate diagnosis and staging of disease. There is extensive data in the literature indicating the importance of FDG-PET imaging in accurately characterizing disease, as well as determining stage and sites of recurrent disease in many cancer types. For these indications, functional imaging with PET provides unique information which is not available from standard medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound, X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The objectives of this study are to document the safety and efficacy of 18F-FDG produced by the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) at its Tri-University Meson Facility (TRIUMF) production facility and to evaluate FDG-PET as a diagnostic and decision making tool in the management of oncology patients in British Columbia. With a population base of over 4 million people, standardized cancer treatment protocols, and evidence based guidelines for FDG-PET imaging, the BCCA is positioned to make an important contribution to defining the role of PET in the Canadian health care system.

Atomized Intranasal Vs Intravenous Ketorolac in Acute Renal Colic Pain Management. Introduction: Pain is a common reason for individuals to seek health care, especially emergency care. Ketorolac has numerous advantages over other pain medications, especially the opioids. The intranasal administration of ketorolac has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of postoperative pain following major abdominal surgery and post dental surgery, but there have been no studies evaluating the use of intranasal ketorolac for the treatment of acute renal colic pain in the emergency department.  Methods: This is a double blinded randomized controlled trial. two hundred renal colic patients presented to the emergency department will be randomized to intervention (30 mg intranasal ketorolac) and (30mg intravenous ketorolac) case groups. Their pain before and after receiving ketorolac will be measured by visual Analog Scale (VAS pain score). Patient, attending physician and administering nurse will be blinded throughout the study. The analgesic effects will be assessed by several measures including pain relief, pain intensity difference, global pain evaluation, global assessment of analgesia, and the summed pain intensity difference. The safety will be assessed by documentation of adverse events, vital signs, and clinical assessment before and after drug administration.  Aim: The aim of this study is to compare analgesic effects of intranasal Ketorolac tromethamine versus intravenous Ketorolac tromethamine in adult patients with moderate to severe renal colic.  Primary Objective: Analgesic effects of Intranasal Ketorolac on the visual analog scale (VAS).  Secondary Objectives: Adverse Events, the need of rescue pain medications, time to discharge and recurrent visit within 24 hours.  Patient Population: Adults (from age 18 to 64 years) who presents to emergency department (ED) at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital with moderate to severe acute flank pain suggestive of renal colic (visual analog scale 7 or more).  Intervention: Single dose of intranasal ketorolac 30mg.  Clinical measurement: Visual Analog Scale will be assessed at 0, 30 and 60 minutes after intervention. Number and dosage of rescue medication, any reported events by patient or attending physician will be documented.  Outcome: Decrease in pain measures by VAS pain score after intranasal ketorolac is given, tolerability and safety evaluation.
Randomized-controlled Trial of Preoperative Inspiratory Muscle Training on Postoperative Complications Rehabilitation strategies after abdominal surgery enhance recovery and improve outcome. A cornerstone of rehabilitation is respiratory physiotherapy with inspiratory muscle training to enhance pulmonary function. Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing functional capacity before surgery in order to compensate for the stress of surgery and postoperative recovery. There is growing interest in deploying pre-habilitation interventions prior to surgery.  The aim of this study is to assess the impact of preoperative inspiratory muscle training on postoperative overall morbidity. The question is, whether inspiratory muscle training prior to elective abdominal surgery reduces the number of postoperative complications and their severity grade.
Safety & Efficacy of Durvalumab+Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for High-risk Urothelial Carcinoma of the Upper Urinary Tract Following radical nephrectomy (RNU) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) most patients face a poor prognosis. Indeed, patients who have undergone RNU for UTUC have 5-year recurrence-free and cancer specific survival probabilities of 69% and 73% respectively.  The primary objective of this study is to assess the pathological complete response rate to combination therapy with neoadjuvant durvalumab and chemotherapy (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) before surgery in patients with high-risk, localized, non-metastatic urothelial carcinomas of the upper tract.
Clinical Investigation of Wysa Mental health concerns are a large burden for individuals, healthcare systems, and the economy. Over a million people are referred to UK mental health services each year, but more than half only receive one session of workbook-based support. Many others have to wait over 12 weeks for assessment and treatment. Wysa is a digital health app with over 3 million users that uses an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot and a series of self-care exercises to provide mental health support and to help people develop strategies to manage their mental health and improve their resilience.  This project aims to examine the impact of using Wysa on patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression during the referral process for standard UK mental health services. Patients will be given access to Wysa at the point of referral to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme and can begin to explore the self-support tools, while they are on the waitlist for assessment and treatment. The investigators will gather a group of patients and members of the public to contribute to the recruitment of patients for the study, the methods we use to evaluate Wysa, and to provide insights on how best to share the results of our study with the general public.  The investigators will use the standard IAPT measures of anxiety and depression to look at the effect of using Wysa patients' mental well-being. These questionnaires will be provided through the app and the results will be compared with a waitlist control group. The investigators will examine whether Wysa can identify people who are experiencing severe mental health difficulties so that they can be provided with additional support. Users' levels of engagement with Wysa will be assessed and some participants will be randomly selected to do an interview so the investigators can get a better understanding of what people liked and disliked about using the app and why. Finally, the investigators will be evaluating the cost-effectiveness of Wysa compared with usual care.  The investigators expect that the study will show that Wysa helps reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression in people who are on the waiting list for IAPT. If the study shows this positive impact, this will provide evidence to support the use of Wysa to improve the accessibility of mental health support in clinical pathways. The investigators will be publishing the results of our study in academic journals as well as in more generally accessible platforms.
the Influence of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Inflammation During Human Endotoxemia In a wide range of auto-inflammatory and infectious diseases attenuation of the immune response could be beneficial. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been identified as a means of protecting patients undergoing cardiac surgery from perioperative myocardial ischemic damage. This protection can be divided in a 'first window of protection' directly after preconditioning and a 'second window' that protects patients 12-48 hour after preconditioning. Repeated RIPC might have additional value, possibly by combining beneficial effects of the first and second windows of protection. The mechanisms behind these effects are under investigation, but attenuation of the inflammatory response is a major candidate. However, this has not yet been demonstrated in the setting of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo. This study aims to investigate the effects of (repeated) ischemic preconditioning on inflammation during human endotoxemia.

Preventing Nephrotoxicity and Ototoxicity From Osteosarcoma Therapy Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer in children, adolescents and young adults. Treatment with surgery and a combination of three conventional chemotherapy drugs can cure nearly two-thirds patients with osteosarcoma, but the treatment can also cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and cause permanent hearing loss. The purpose of this study is to evaluate new approaches to prevent these side effects without interfering with the beneficial effects of the chemotherapy drugs on the cancer by using our knowledge of how the drugs damage the kidney and cochlear hair cells in the ear to selectively block these side effects. Preventing these side effects without interfering with the anti-cancer effect of the drugs will improve the outcome in survivors and may also improve the effectiveness of the chemotherapy regimen by preventing treatment delays and dose reductions that are often caused by the side effects. Patients will be carefully monitored to ensure that the new interventions do not adversely affect response to the treatment and do not increase the other side effects of the chemotherapy. Specifically, we will monitor the nutritional status of the patients closely and ask patients to complete a survey describing the side effects after each treatment cycle. We will also collect a small sample of cancer tissue at the time of biopsy and surgery from each patient on this study for testing to determine new classes of anti-cancer drugs currently under development may have a role in treating osteosarcoma. If effective, these new approaches to prevent kidney damage and hearing loss will be applicable in other types of cancers treated with the same chemotherapy drugs.
Sorafenib and Topotecan in Refractory/Recurrent Pediatric Malignancies H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute will be the Sunshine Project Coordinator, but will not be recruiting locally.  The purpose of this research study is to establish a dose of the combination of drugs, Topotecan and Sorafenib in children. This will be called the maximum tolerated dose. The chemotherapy in this study is a combination of Topotecan and Sorafenib. The investigators are trying to find the highest dose of Topotecan and Sorafenib that can be given safely to children with Refractory or Recurrent Pediatric Solid Malignancies. The investigators will do this by testing different doses of these drugs in different groups of children. The investigators will also study how the body processes these drugs.
The Covid-19 Outpatient Symptom Montelukast Oximetry Trial Primary care physicians face limited availability of therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral therapies that are currently approved for use in the outpatient setting by Health Canada have excluded pregnant women and older adults from their clinical trials, are contraindicated for many patients, and most are prohibited for use by pregnant women. Identification of a safe, COVID-19 outpatient therapeutic with 20-year safety record remains urgently needed.

Validation of BIVA for Nutritional Assessment in Cirrhotic Patients Despite the importance of nutritional status in patient's outcome, there is no gold standard for nutritional assessment. Traditional techniques used in healthy subjects to assess nutritional status cannot be used in cirrhotic patients due especially to ascites and peripheral edema, and altered rates of biochemical markers due to liver failure.  Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis has emerged as a useful method to assess body composition and nutritional status especially in patients at the extremes of body weight (fluid overload, excess of adipose tissue, etc.).  With previous results from our research group, BIVA showed to be useful for evaluating cirrhotic patients.  The aim of this study is to validate our previous results and validate BIVA for nutritional assessment in patients with liver cirrhosis

Factors Influencing Postural Balance and Movement in Individuals With Stroke There are several factors influencing on balance and movement in individuals with stroke, such as previous stroke, age, bowel incontinence, visuospatial problem. However, those factors involving in postural control and voluntary movement were studied in subacute and chronic phase of stroke, but not in the acute period. The aim of the study is to determine factors for postural control and voluntary movement in individuals with acute stroke and then follow at the first, third, and sixth month.
Effectiveness of Intensive Perioperative Nutrition Therapy Among Adults Undergoing Gastrointestinal & Oncology Surgery Perioperative malnutrition is common in patients undergoing gastrointestinal and oncological surgery and it also associated with longer hospital stays, reduced responses to and increased complications from therapies, increased costs, poorer quality of life and lower survival rate. Evidence has shown that appropriate perioperative nutrition therapy have a significantly improve perioperative outcomes. Current practice emphasises the roles of early nutrition therapy as early intervention in order to combat the post-operative complications of patients and the implementation is now widely adopted. However, there is very limited data to date on the effects of perioperative nutrition therapy in patients before hospital admission, during hospital stay and after discharge to prevent the post-operative complications. Therefore, there is a need to study in this area in order to determine the effects of perioperative nutrition therapy to overcome the post-operative complications in patients undergoing surgery. This is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial will be conducted among sixty eight adults patient undergoing major elective surgery in Hospital Serdang. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups by means of sealed envelope into Intervention Group (SS) or Control Group (NN). All data will be collected during a face to face interview, blood sampling and direct anthropometric measurement with the participants at Hospital Serdang. The effects of intervention between treatment groups on outcome parameters will be carried out by using the SPSS General Linear Model (GLM) for repeated measure procedure. The perioperative nutrition therapy intervention implemented in the study will serve as a baseline data for providing an appropriate nutritional management in patients undergoing surgery.
The Impact of Perceptual Impairment on Social Participation in Stroke Patients The perceptual change on stroke patients during the movement recovery and its relationship with social participation still remain unclear. The purposes of this study are: 1) to observe the progression of perception deficit and 2) to understand the relationships among perception deficit and other functional indicators.  A total of 90 stroke patients will be recruited. Each patient will receive three times evaluation, including perception tests, motor function test, daily living ability tests and social leisure participation questionnaires.

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation as a Novel Therapeutic Approach in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive weakness and muscular atrophy due to the degeneration and loss of motor neurons, the nerve cells that, in the central nervous system (motor cortex, brainstem and spinal chord), control voluntary movement. Riluzole, the only drug approved for ALS treatment, modestly slow disease progression.  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique of neuromodulation that is currently studied as a possible therapeutic tool for several neurological and psychiatric diseases and has been found safe and well tolerated. Based on experimental evidence in animals and human subjects, tDCS is expected to reduce motor cortex excitability and excitotoxicity, that is neuronal injury induced by excessive glutamatergic stimulation, one of postulated pathophysiological mechanisms in ALS.  This study will investigate if transcranial direct current stimulation of motor cortex is useful in delaying disease progression and is well tolerated in ALS patients.

ANI and NoL Index Variations After Standard Nociceptive Stimulus at 0, 50, 25 % of Inhaled N2O in the Anesthetic Mixture N2O has been used during general anesthesia (GA) for more than 100 years. It is known to have anesthetic agents sparing effect. But small is know on his real analgesic effect during GA. So far, the only way to monitor pain during GA was based on vital signs that are not specific and not sensitive. Few devices tried to evaluated pain under GA during the last 2 decades. More recently, better devices were proposed such as the Physiodoloris device and the PMD200 device. The first offers an index called ANI based on heart rate variability (HRV) assessment. The second offers the NoL index based on the analysis of 5 parameters. The aim of the present study is to evaluate quantitatively the analgesic index of N2O during GA using the two indices ANI and NoL.

Self-management Intervention for Children With Chronic Medical Complexity: Pilot Feasibility Trial The investigators have developed a tool to facilitate self-management for children with medical complexity (complex, multisystem chronic diseases) called MyChildCMC (My Child's Complex Medical Condition). MyChildCMC is an online, phone application (app) that engages parents daily in ongoing monitoring of common, crosscutting acute symptoms, including respiratory distress, inadequate feeding/fluid intake, fever, altered mental status, pain, and seizure status. The MyChildCMC app also guides parents to recognize early warning signs for health deteriorations to avoid acute events (i.e., ED visits and/or hospitalizations).  Parent comments during the development of the MyChildCMC application revealed that the tool had potential in helping them manage their child's chronic conditions. This study will be the first to explore if online home monitoring using online technology is feasible, scalable, and can lead to improved CMC outcomes. This pilot feasibility trial for the MyChildCMC app will determine app feasibility and if successful, our approach will be a model for improving CMC care and reducing costs for families and children with medical complexity. Future MyChildCMC trials will integrate care coordination and a more robust alert system to help facilitate care and follow-up for patients.
Rhythm Effect on Dance Learning in Children With and Without Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral Palsy (CP) leads to motor impairments and impacts activities of daily living and academic and social achievement (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Children with CP present impaired procedural learning abilities that is the ability to acquire cognitive-motor skills with practice (Gagliardi et al., 2011; Gofer-Levi et al., 2013). However, some rehabilitative rhythmic interventions, such as adaptive dance training, appear to improve motor, cognitive, psycho-emotional, and social functions in these children (Cherriere, Martel, et al., 2020; Cherriere, Robert, et al., 2020). Rhythm seems to be an important factor in these benefits, probably because regular rhythm improves motor control and learning (Thaut, 2015; Lagarrigue et al., 2021; Ghai et al., 2022). To validate this hypothesis, the investigators propose to evaluate the effects the presence of a regular rhythm on learning of a danse choreography in typically developing children and children with CP.

First-in-human Study of OVM-200 as a Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine OVM-200 will be tested in humans for the first time in Study OVM-200-100. Up to 52 patients aged 18-75 with prostate, lung or ovarian cancer will be enrolled in the Study to find out if OVM-200 is safe to continue studying it in patients with cancer. The Study consists of 2 parts: a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part. In the dose escalation part, up to 4 increasing doses of OVM-200 will be evaluated in small groups of cancer patients to find the recommended dose for the expansion part. The recommended dose of OVM-200 will then be given to cancer patients in the dose expansion part to confirm safety and understand how effective it is against their disease and if there are any side effects.  Patients who agree to participate in the Study and pass screening will receive 3 doses of OVM-200 in total at 2-week intervals as an injection under the skin. After completing treatment with OVM-200 patients will be followed up for side effects and to monitor changes in their cancer. Patients will stay on the Study for about 6 months in total during which they will have 10 hospital visits. The Study will run at around 5 sites in the UK.

Improving Antibiotic Use in Acute Care Treatment Purpose The emergence and rapid rise in antibiotic resistance among common bacteria are adversely affecting the clinical course and health care costs of community-acquired infections. Because antibiotic resistance rates are strongly correlated with antibiotic use patterns, multiple organizations have declared reductions in unnecessary antibiotic use to be critical components of efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. Among humans, the vast majority of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are used to treat acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) that have a viral etiology. Although the rate of antibiotic prescribing for ARIs by office-based physicians in the US has decreased about 16% from its peak in 1997, the rate of antibiotic prescribing in acute care settings (eg, emergency departments and urgent care centers), which account for 1 in 5 ambulatory antibiotic prescriptions in the US, has shown only a modest decline (6%) during this period. Translation of lessons from intervention studies in office-based practices is needed to improve antibiotic use in acute care settings.
Inhaled Sedation Using the Anesthetic-conserving Device ( ANACONDA) in Prehospital Emergency Medecine. Achieving the optimal sedation level for patient management is not always possible using our standard intravenous medications in Pre-hospital Emergency medicine. Inhaled sedation is possible with the Anesthetic-conserving device with a standard respirator.  The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of halogenated agents allow deep sedation quickly after absorption.  The feasibility of inhaled sedation has never been studied in hospital.

A Study of Revumenib in Combination With Chemotherapy for Patients Diagnosed With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia This phase II trial tests the safety and best dose of revumenib when given together with chemotherapy, and how well the treatment regimen works for infants and young children with leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) and is associated with a KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangement (KMT2A-R). Revumenib is an oral medicine that directly targets the changes that occur in a cell with a KMT2A rearrangement and has been shown to specifically kill these leukemia cells in test tubes and animals. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, prednisone, asparaginase, fludarabine and cytarabine work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial is being done to find out if the combination of revumenib and chemotherapy may help to treat the cancer cells better than either treatment alone.

Hyperpolarized Xenon Imaging in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis Chronic lung diseases show a gradual onset of irreversible lung damage which can lead to severe breathing problems and/or respiratory failure. Imaging is central to guiding treatment; however, current techniques are either inaccurate or involve exposure to radiation. Recent developments in lung magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide promise as a radiation-free alternative. However, conventional MRI cannot directly show changes in distribution of inhaled air or absorption of gas which are important signs of early lung disease. Recently MRI imaging of the inhaled gas contrast agent Xenon has been developed which can provide this important information. This study aims to determine how Xenon MRI can help determine air flow distribution and gas uptake in the lungs. The investigators will also be able to compare the information from patients with that from healthy volunteers. This should give insight into the processes involved in chronic lung diseases and help evaluate disease extent in patients.

Clinical Decision Support for Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major public health problem: it impairs quality of life and independently heightens the risks of ischemic stroke, heart failure and all-cause mortality. AF is a common reason for presenting to emergency departments (ED) in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and is associated with frequent hospitalization. Additionally, inter-facility hospitalization rates for AF vary across KPNC. Improvements in modifiable components of ED AF care could potentially reduce low-yield hospitalizations and the associated costs, patient inconveniences, and complications that can ensue. Real-time clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can transform entrenched physician practices and improve patient outcomes. The investigators will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial of a CDSS intervention across 13 KPNC EDs for the comprehensive management of acute AF with the following three aims: 1) To evaluate the impact of the CDSS intervention on index hospitalization rates; 2) To evaluate the impact of the CDSS intervention on ED AF rate and rhythm control process-of-care metrics; and 3) To evaluate the impact of the CDSS intervention on AF stroke prevention actions for eligible participants at the time of ED discharge. The investigators hypothesize that the CDSS intervention will safely reduce index hospitalization rates, improve rate and rhythm control process-of-care metrics, and increase stroke prevention actions for eligible participants at ED discharge and within 30 days.

Implementing Resistance Exercise to Reduce Frailty for Older Adult To develop an intervention specifically targeted for these clients who have the frailty syndrome. The Investigators propose to develop an exercise intervention that can reduce frailty in older adults to facilitate their ability to age-in-place. The long-term objective of this work is to develop a package of interventions that can be administered within the existing Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver programs. The specific goal of this proposal is to develop a resistance exercise intervention to reduce frailty in older adults receiving long term care services in their home through the Illinois Community Care Program, a HCBS Waiver Program.
Long Sleep Duration and Vascular Function Sleep duration has received much attention in recent years due to strong evidence that not enough sleep can increase risk for a number of diseases and disorders. Research is emerging that too much sleep also has a negative impact on health, particularly higher risk for myocardial infarction and stroke. The investigators hypothesize that long duration sleep has the ability to impair peripheral and cerebral vascular function in middle-aged to older adults.

Study participants will be randomized into two arms for different breathing practices.
Methyl-donor Nutrient Supplementation and Methylation Profile in Lupus Patients With Obesity Dietary supplementation with methyl donors has been demonstrated to increase DNA methylation in leucocytes whereas a limited dietary intake of methyl donors was associated with DNA hypomethylation. Considering SLE disease, previously study showed that high doses of vitamin B6 and folate were associated with less severe SLE. Furthermore, some evidences reported a relatively high incidence of decreased serum B12 levels in rheumatic patients. This led to the suggestion that diets rich in methyl group donors could have beneficial effects on SLE.

Testing New Marketing Models for Improved Cookstoves - Uganda The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of different sales offers and different marketing messages to increase the uptake of energy efficient cookstoves.  This research will address the following major barriers to the acquisition and correct use of improved cookstoves into four main categories:  * Inappropriate product or marketing for intended users * Lack of consumer trust in new products * Failure to address consumers' financial constraints * Failure to achieve behavioral change  To do so this research includes 3 Randomized Controlled Trials including:RCT 1- Testing the Effectiveness of Marketing Messages in Increasing Willingness to Pay; RCT 2- Testing the Effectiveness of the Novel Sales Offer and its ability to Increase Uptake of Purchasing Energy Efficient Cookstoves; and RCT 3-Measure the Effects of Fuel Efficient Cookstoves on Health, Fuel Use and Time Spent Collecting Fuel.  RCT 1 studies the price women are willing to pay for the improved stove. It will also test the effects of the two most effective marketing messages identified during the Phase 1 Feasibility stage (e.g., improved health, saves time, and has high status) on increasing willingness to pay. RCT 1 will run second price auctions in 36 parishes with an average of 60 participants per meeting.  From RCT 1, RCT 2 tests the effect of a Novel Sales Offer- which includes a free trial, and time payments- on purchasing decisions of participants versus those that receive the Traditional Offer- a cash and carry offer. Based on a pilot in urban Kampala conducted by Dr. David I. Levine (co-P.I. on this project) results show a 44% uptake for households offered the novel offer vs. a 4% uptake for those offered the traditional offer. The hypothesis is a novel offer will significantly increase uptake of fuel efficient cookstoves in rural Uganda when compared to a traditional offer.  RCT 3 measures the impacts of fuel efficient cookstoves on health, fuel usage, and time spent collecting fuel. For RCT 3 we will randomize those who accept the Novel Offer into early and late groups. To measure the impacts of improved stoves on health, fuel use, time spent collecting fuel, etc., there will be a baseline and follow-up survey and associated quantitative measures on our full sample and a small endline on select quantitative measures for a sub-sample.

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Elderly Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Lung cancer is responsible for one of the highest incidences of cancer-related mortality globally, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the biggest subtype of lung cancer. In recent years, the use of immunotherapy has revolutionised the management of NSCLC, with better response rates and survival outcomes reported in the literature, compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Despite this, doubts remain regarding the true efficacy of immunotherapy in patients \> 75 years old, given that this age subgroup is mis-represented in prospective phase III trials, in terms of numbers and baseline functional status, compared to real-world experience.  Furthermore, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is associated with a spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), affecting a range of organ systems. Once again, there are doubts about the safety of the use of these agents in patients \> 75 years old, and whether baseline performance status and comorbidities are good predictors of efficacy and safety outcomes in this elderly patient subgroup.  Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) and the vulnerable elders survey (VES-13) are assessment tools that provide a good indication of functional status in elderly patients, in a similar capacity to performance status and comorbidities. This study therefore aims to prospectively examine patients \> 70 years old with a diagnosis of NSCLC, commencing immunotherapy. It will assess CGA and VES-13 scores at baseline, and correlate this with certain outcomes such as the incidence of severe adverse effects from immunotherapy at 3 and 6 months, any admissions to hospital arising from immunotherapy toxicities (and the subsequent length of inpatient stay), and mortality within 30 days. In doing so, it will help to determine if CGA and VES-13 scores can be used as a reliable indication of possible future efficacy and toxicity outcomes in this elderly patient subgroup.
Alemtuzumab to Treat Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of alemtuzumab (Campath® (Registered Trademark)) for improving muscle strength in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). The most common inflammatory muscle disease in people over the age of 50, s-IBM progresses steadily, leading to severe weakness and wasting of the muscles in the arms and legs. The cause of s-IBM is not known, but it may be an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune cells (white blood cells) attack and destroy parts of muscle. Alemtuzumab is a laboratory-made antibody currently approved to treat certain leukemias. It has also been used to treat patients with autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, multiple sclerosis, and tissue rejection associated with transplantation. Alemtuzumab destroys white blood cells that have a protein called CD52 on their surface and that might be among the cells attacking muscle.  Patients with s-IBM are eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with physical and neurological examinations, blood tests, and an electrocardiogram. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:  * Campath administration: Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 1 to 1-1/2 weeks for intravenous infusions of Campath, given every other day for a total of 4 infusions. * Follow-up visits after infusions: Patients are monitored for up to 1 year with periodic blood tests, physical and neurological examinations, medical history, muscle strength measurements, and a review of symptoms, including the ability to perform daily living activities. * Lymphapheresis: Patients undergo this procedure for collecting large numbers of white blood cells twice - once at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months. Blood is removed through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a machine that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells and plasma are removed and the red cells and platelets are returned to the patients through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm. * Muscle biopsy: Muscle biopsies are done in the operating room under local anesthetic. A small incision is made in the thigh or upper arm and a small piece of muscle is removed. Biopsies are done at the beginning of the study and again after 6 months.

Evaluating the Pharmacokinetics and Patient Outcomes of Buprenorphine Microdosing There are more than 2.1 million people in the United States with opioid use disorder, and according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention opioid overdose deaths rose 36% to more than 69,000 deaths in 2020. Treatment with buprenorphine or methadone reduces overdose deaths in patients with opioid use disorder. However, most patients with opioid use disorder do not receive treatment. In addition to the rising rates of morbidity and mortality, the healthcare, social, and societal costs of the opioid epidemic are roughly one trillion dollars annually. Rapidly scalable strategies are needed to increase access to treatment and improve treatment retention.  The investigators propose a novel buprenorphine micro-dosing study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, treatment retention, and qualitative outcomes in participants transitioning from methadone maintenance therapy to buprenorphine using a micro-dosing initiation in the outpatient setting. The proposed study will report participant pharmacokinetics, treatment retention, Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score, Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) score, and other qualitative outcomes.

The secondary objective of each trial is to compare the long term safety of tiotropium with placebo in this patient population.
Dissector Assisted Malar Elevation for Rhytidoplasty BACKGROUND: Endoscopy was first used in plastic surgery for the treatment of frontal rhytides. This minimally invasive approach allows the treatment of frontal wrinkles using a practical procedure that does not directly interfere with the frontalis muscle, acting only on its antagonists.  It is also possible to treat the middle third of the face, but these evolutions depends on special surgical instruments. Videoendoscopic approach in rhytidoplasty have been improved by new devices and surgical instruments.  The mid third of the face can be treated in different ways. Zygomatic projection can be achieved by the use of the Dissector Assisted Malar Elevation (DAME) procedure.  AIM: Evaluate the zygomatic projection achieved by DAME in videoendoscopic rhytidoplasties.  METHODS: 30 non-white female patients, 30 to 59 years old, will be submitted to videoendoscopic rhytidoplasty with malar elevation by the DAME. Pre- and post-operative facial appearance will be evaluated by digital photogrammetry.
Aldesleukin With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma RATIONALE: Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill tumor cells.

Patients-Controlled Epidural Analgesia After Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity Using Morphine-Levobupivacaine Regimens Adequate postoperative analgesia can facilitate recovery following gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity. The efficacy and safety of intravenous patient - controlled analgesia has been studied, but up to date no data are available concerning the use of thoracic epidural patient-controlled analgesia regarding the use of levobupivacaine combined with morphine in morbidly obese patients. The investigators' aim in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was to compare the analgesic effectiveness, the dose requirements and side effects of thoracic epidural patient controlled analgesia 0.1% and 0.2% levobupivacaine combined with a continuous epidural administration of morphine, with or without a loading dose, after open gastric bypass for morbid obesity.
Clinical Application of Stem Cell Educator Therapy in Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease that results in loss of body hair in varying degrees. The condition is estimated to affect more than 6.8 million people in the United States alone (naaf.org), with a worldwide prevalence of 0.1% to 0.2% and calculated lifetime risk of 2%. AA is the most common form of the disease, in which areas of complete hair loss arise within normal hair-bearing skin. Other forms include alopecia totalis (AT), characterized by total loss of scalp hair, and alopecia universalis (AU), characterized by complete loss of body hair. AA and its variants can have devastating effects on patients' quality of life and social functioning. At present, curative therapy for AA does not exist. Therapeutic options are currently very limited, such as intralesional injections of glucocorticoids and induction of allergic contact dermatitis. These therapies are not effective for many patients and are generally impractical for patients with diffuse AA, AT or AU. Recently, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors were effective for the treatment of severe AA. However, for those patients who do respond, relapses are common after discontinuation of treatment, due to the existing of autoimmune memory T cells. Stem Cell Educator (SCE) therapy, which uses only autologous mononuclear cells that are externally exposed to cord blood stem cells, has previously been proven safe and effective in subjects for the improvement of type 1 diabetes (T1D), T2D and other autoimmune diseases such as alopecia areata. Minoxidil is the FDA approved drug for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in 1988. This trial will explore the therapeutic potential of Stem Cell Educator therapy for the treatment of AA by using topical minoxidil as control.

Post-operative or Early Salvage XRT and ADT for High Risk PCa RATIONALE: Conformal radiation therapy uses a 3-dimensional (3-D) image of the tumor to help focus thin beams of radiation directly on the tumor. Giving conformal external-beam radiation therapy in higher doses over a shorter period of time may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy, such as leuprolide acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective when given together with or without hormone therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer who have undergone surgery.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with radiation therapy given together with hormone therapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III prostate cancer.

Modulation of Cognitive Control by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Insufficient cognitive control over emotional distracters is characteristic for major depressive disorder (MDD). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is associated with this deficit. In this study the investigators assess the effect of an enhancement of dlPFC activity in MDD patients by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive control.  In a double-blinded, balanced randomized, sham-controlled crossover trial the investigators determine the effect of a single-session tDCS to the left dlPFC on cognitive control in MDD patients and healthy controls. To assess the cognitive control the investigators use a delayed response working memory (DWM) task with pictures of varying valence presented during the delay period.
Effect of TA-65MD on Healthy Volunteers TA-65 MD® is pure, natural, plant-based compound that can help maintain or rebuild telomeres. A telomere is a region of repetitive DNA at the end of a chromosome, which protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration. They shorten during cell division and eventually signal an irreversible state of growth arrest known as cellular senescence. The length of a person's telomeres is an indicator of his or her overall health status; short telomeres have been associated with cellular aging and dysfunction.
Effects of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment and Bio Electro-Magnetic Regulation Therapy on Low Back Pain in Adults. It is clear that low back pain (LBP) is a major challenge in our society, which can lead to severe disability in many individuals. Although there are several different treatments and approaches to help individuals with LBP, the number affected by this condition has been steadily increasing.  OMT has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of LBP. In fact, the use of OMT has been shown to increase mobility of the lumbar myofascial tissues, visceral motion and decrease pain in patients with LBP. Bio Electro-Magnetic Regulation (BEMER) Therapy is a therapeutic modality that deploys a biorhythmically defined stimulus through a Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF), which leads to an increase in blood flow. The positive effects of BEMER on the circulation has been shown to result in significant increases in arteriovenous oxygen difference, number of open capillaries, arteriolar and venular flow volume, and flow rate of red blood cells in the microvasculature. Therefore, BEMER can potentially be used in the treatment of LBP by improving microcirculation in muscular tissue. In fact, BEMER with physiotherapy showed reductions in pain and fatigue acutely in patients with chronic low back pain. A systemic review of randomized controlled trials that investigated whether PEMF was effective in low back pain showed there was decrease in pain intensity and improved functionality in individuals with different low back pain conditions.  Therefore, it is plausible that the combination of OMT and BEMER therapy may help increase circulation to myofascial structures that influence low back restriction and pain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the individual and combined effects of OMT and BEMER therapy on low back pain.
Comparing the Rate of Insufficient Cells for Diagnosis Between Surepath® and Conventional Smear in Women After Radiation Therapy for Cervical Cancer Background/Purpose: This is a large scale, multicenter randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility of using SurePath® in cervical cancer patients after radiation therapy by comparing the incidence of unsatisfactory smear and the accuracy of detecting cervicovaginal lesions between the SurePath® and the conventional smear.  Patients and Methods: The investigators will invite all women who had received radiotherapy for cervical cancer in the investigators outpatient clinics. All enrolled cases will ask to receive randomly the SurePath® or the conventional smear.  Expected Results: The investigators will get the incidence of unsatisfactory smear and the accuracy of detecting cervicovaginal lesions between the SurePath® and the conventional smear in patients who underwent radiotherapy.
The Association Between Parental Anxiety and Child Behavior. Parents' dental anxiety is demonstrated as a significant indicator for children's dental anxiety and parents play a key role in children's anxiety and fear development.  Studies have shown that parents who are fearful and anxious about dental treatments are associated with an increase in the occurrence of caries disease in their children, since they are more resistant to accompany their children to the dentist.  People with a high level of dental anxiety, both children and adults, can be difficult to treat, take longer, and have behavioral issues, all of which can lead to a stressful and unpleasant experience for both the patient and the dental practitioner
Characteristics of Patients With Dementia Who Are Screaming in Nursing Homes Patients with dementia develop behavioral problems over time. Among these, the investigators object screams or cries or disruptives vocalizations. Their cause is multifactorial and their management difficult in nursing homes. Often this patients are polymedicated, sedated or/and isolated.  Many scientific studies are interested in drug and non-drug treatments. In this study, the investigators are looking for a profile for disruptives vocalizations's patients. Thus, the investigators will study the global profile of demented patients residing in EHPAD to determine if there are any similarities between them.

A-botulinic Toxin for Symptomatic Benign Prostate Hypertrophy BPH is very common in elderly men, it is a stromal as well as epithelial invasion of the prostatic gland. Due to an imbalance between growth and apoptosis cellular mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. It is the same for symptomatology and urodynamic obstruction without clear identification of the part which is due to static phenomena (volume increase) and dynamic reports (α 1-receptor action). That explains the multiplicity of treatments and the difficulty of therapeutic indications between monitoring, medical treatment, and surgical operation. Experimental studies of BONT-A intra prostatic injection on animal and human models, have shown efficacy in BPH cell apoptosis, decrease in cell growth and decline in the number of adrenergic α1 receptors.  Many studies in humans show therapeutic efficacy leading to a possible use of BONT-A as mini invasive treatment of symptomatic BPH, as an alternative to medical or surgical treatment.  PROTOX study proposes to evaluate tolerance and effectiveness of the intra-prostatique BONT-A injection in the treatment of symptomatic BPH.

Effect of Time-Restricted Feeding on Fat Loss and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Overweight Adults Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a novel type of intermittent fasting that involves eating within a daily period of 10 hours or less, followed by fasting for at least 14 hours daily. Several studies in rodents report that TRF reduces body weight, improves blood sugar control, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease-even when food intake is matched to the control group or no weight loss occurs. Preliminary evidence suggests that TRF may also increase weight loss, fat loss, and reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in humans. This study will test whether TRF enhances fat loss and increases weight loss in adults with obesity, relative to conventional dieting alone. In addition, this study will determine whether TRF reduces risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and will measure the feasibility and acceptability of TRF.  In conjunction with the parent study described above, four ancillary studies will be conducted:  1. Effect of weight loss on nitrogen metabolism and bacteria in the mouth. The primary endpoints for this ancillary study are plasma and salivary nitrate and nitrite, and the secondary endpoints are salivary nitrate reductase activity and salivary bacterial abundance. 2. Effect of weight loss on several biomarkers related to kidney stones. The primary endpoint for this ancillary study is urinary oxalate, and the secondary endpoints are urinary citrate, chloride, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, and creatinine. 3. Effect of meal timing on blood pressure regulation and kidney function. The primary endpoints of this ancillary study include urinary aldosterone excretion, sodium, potassium, and endothelin, whereas the secondary endpoints include nitric oxide and albumin. Additional exploratory endpoints include renal injury markers (KIM-1, nephrin, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio), measures of reactive oxidative stress (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and TBARs), and urinary exosomes. Urine will be analyzed in 12-hour bins to determine how meal timing affects differentially affects these endpoints during the daytime and nighttime. The effects of weight loss on these endpoints may also be considered. 4. Validation of a meal timing questionnaire to assess the distribution of food intake throughout the day.

Potential EEG Biomarkers and Antiepileptogenic Strategies for Epilepsy in TSC To determine whether EEGs during infancy is a reliable biomarker to identify TSC patients that will develop infantile spasms/epilepsy in the near future and thus are appropriate candidates for an antiepileptogenic drug trial. Since not all patients with TSC develop epilepsy, it would be useful to have a biomarker that could predict those patients destined to have epilepsy and thus identify those TSC patients most appropriate for an antiepileptogenic drug trial. A recent study suggests that treating TSC patients with an abnormal EEG prior to onset of infantile spasms with vigabatrin may improve neurological outcome, but the use of EEG as a reliable biomarker of future epilepsy has not been rigorously validated. In this specific aim, we will test the reliability of EEG in predicting future development of infantile spasms or epilepsy in TSC patients during the first year of life.

Total Knee Arthroplasty and Augmented Reality-based Navigation System The purpose of Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is to remove worn cartilage surfaces and replace them with artificial parts of the same shape. TKR can be used in cases of osteoarthritis, inflammatory rheumatism, bone necrosis of the knee or following malformative or traumatic sequelae.  Implant alignment is paramount in TKR and the last years have seen a proliferation of alignment techniques following the introduction of computer and robotic-assisted surgery. Among Computer-assisted surgery, the augmented reality-based navigation system can be an option to improve accuracy in orthopaedic surgery.  The hypothesis of this study is: the use of augmented reality-based navigation system allows a prosthesis alignment and positioning that is at least as good as with the traditional mechanically aligned technique, and therefore improves knee functional results. This study also aims at assessing the cost-effectiveness of this new technology.
Remote Postconditioning in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated by Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Background: Experimental studies suggest that remote limb ischaemic postconditioning (RemPostCon) can reduce infarct size in pigs. Initial clinical applications support the beneficial role of RemPostCon in preserving endothelial function during upper limb ischemia in healthy volunteers and in patients with stable coronary artery disease.  Aim of the study: To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of RemPostCon in the setting of STEMI and primary PCI (pPCI) and to investigate potential circulating mediators of its effects.  Patients and methods: Patients who undergo pPCI for anterior STEMI within 6 hours since the onset of symptoms are randomly assigned to receive either RemPostCon + pPCI or pPCI alone in a single-blind fashion. All patients receive therapy according to the current international guidelines. Three cycles of ischemia-reperfusion are provided to the lower limb inflating a cuff to 200 mmHg. Each cycle consists of 5' of ischaemia, followed by 5' of reperfusion. RemPostCon is started at the time of angioplasty in the infarct related artery. Primary endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) of creatinine kinase - MB (CK - MB). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is performed early before discharge and 4 months after the event, if there are no contraindications.

The Effect of Training Given to Nurses Caring for Dying Cancer Patients and Their Families on Care and Difficulties Nursing is a profession that is human and is based on nursing care. Humans are social creatures that need care from the moment they are born.Today's scientific developments and changing technology have affected the health system.Many dying patients want to be hospitalized in order to receive better care and treatment. Depending on this situation, the frequency of nurses giving care to dying patients and their families has increased in hospitals. In order to increase the quality of the care given to the dying patient and his family and to reduce the difficulties experienced while giving this care, the nurse who provides the care should have sufficient knowledge and skills about the care of the dying patient and his family.  This research will be conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine the effect of education on the nursing care given and the difficulties experienced by the nurses who care for the dying cancer patients and their families.

Pentostatin and Lymphocyte Infusion in Preventing Graft Rejection in Patients Who Have Undergone Donor Stem Cell Transplant This phase II trial studies pentostatin and donor lymphocyte infusion in preventing graft rejection in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant. Giving pentostatin and an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after a donor stem cell transplant may stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving pentostatin before donor lymphocyte infusion may stop this from happening.

Digitised Home Based Care for Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease is the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes a wide range of movement-related (motor) problems (slowness, stiffness, tremor, balance difficulties) and non-motor problems (disturbances of thinking, memory, perception, mood, bladder, bowels, blood pressure). Even before the pandemic, NHS services were struggling to meet the demand for care.  To address this need for support, the investigators have co-designed an innovative digital care pathway, Home Based Care (HBC), with people with Parkinson's (PwP) and care partners (CP) to deliver self-management support and clinical expertise to the patient's home. This pathway is supported by remote monitoring with a wrist-worn sensor and questionnaires.  In this study, the investigators will be digitising this pathway so that data from a variety of sources (including the sensor, questionnaires, and patients' health records) can be combined in one place to enable more personalised care and to provide advice to support self-management of symptoms by patients.  After the investigators have set up the digitised pathway, its implementation will be evaluated with a group of 120 people with Parkinson's and their care partners and associated healthcare providers through the Plymouth Parkinson's Service. The investigators will examine participants' adoption of and engagement with the patient-facing digital platform over the course of 3 months and gather their feedback about its usability and acceptability. A smaller group of the participants will discuss their experiences in more detail to help pinpoint aspects that work well and those needing adjustment and development.  The investigators anticipate that this system will result in improved quality of life and care and increased knowledge and confidence for self-managing symptoms. The results of the study will be used to improve the digitised Home Based Care pathway. People with Parkinson's and care partners involved in the project will help guide the sharing of these results with healthcare providers and the general public.

Bioequivalence Study of CRushed TriUMeq With or Without Drip Feed Compared to the Whole Tablet Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor which is marketed as a single tablet (Tivicay®) and in a fixed dose combination tablet with abacavir and lamivudine (Triumeq®, referred to as TRI). For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be problematic and tablets are cut or crushed to ease administration.  Currently there is no information about crushing TRI tablets. Therefore this study will be conducted to investigate whether crushed and suspended TRI and crushed and suspended TRI with drip feed are bioequivalent to taking TRI as a whole.
Mother and Child Health Outcomes After Maternal Bariatric Surgery Childhood obesity has been a growing problem with more than 30% of children between 6 and 19 years old being considered overweight or obese. Obese children are at increased risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and are susceptible to the sociological effects of being overweight. Obesity is a multifactorial disease, is often familial and multi-generational, and studies have shown that parental obesity can increase the risk of a child becoming obese. Currently, one of the most successful treatment options for obesity is bariatric surgery. The Nebraska Medicine Bariatric Center offers patients counseling in improved dietary management, methods to increase physical activity, and psychological support. As part of the programs standard-of-care, each bariatric surgical patient receives consultation with a dietician, psychologist, and an exercise physiologist. We propose that mothers who are enrolled in the surgical weight loss program bring their children to attend the presurgical specialist consultation. Subjects enrolled in the study will have their height, weight, and physical activity assessed at preoperative and postoperative study visits. Study subjects will also complete questionnaires of their self-reported physical activity and eating habits at these study visits. The goal of this pilot study is to examine whether this behavioral intervention will have an impact on the overall health and weight of children whose mothers have received bariatric surgery.

Phase Ib/II Trial of Interleukin-2 and PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitor, Nivolumab In Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer This will be a single arm, multi-site phase Ib/II clinical trial of standard doses of High Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL2) (600,000 IU/kg/dose intravenously during two 5-day cycles 9 days apart) in IL-2 eligible clear cell metastatic RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) subjects in combination with Nivolumab.  Investigators hypothesize that concurrent PD-1 inhibition synergistically enhances the anti-tumor immune response to HD IL-2 in metastatic clear cell RCC. Investigators postulate that the combination of the two therapies would result in an increase in the overall response rate, complete response rate, and improved survival outcomes compared to either of the individual therapies.

Enhanced Problem-Solving Training Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is among the most common injuries sustained by Veterans of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom. It is also highly co-morbid with mental health conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. While mTBI alone is not typically thought to cause lasting deficits in personal functioning or cognitive abilities, Veterans with a history of mTBI nonetheless report chronic psychological distress, as well as subjective difficulties with attention, concentration, poor frustration tolerance, and decision-making. Although current clinical practice guidelines for mTBI emphasize primary care-based symptom management, there are presently no evidence-based interventions to treat mental health symptoms in this setting. This research proposal therefore seeks to adapt and pilot test a brief, primary care-based intervention (E-PST) to reduce psychological distress in Veterans with mTBI by augmenting problem-solving skills, and helping them to develop specific cognitive and behavioral skills to improve upon their self-reported cognitive inefficiencies. The investigators hypothesize that Veterans who complete E-PST will report improvements in psychological distress compared to participants in the control condition.
Kinematic and Neuromuscular Deficiencies Phenotypes Associated With Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the kinematic deficiencies specifically associated with each of the 3 main clinical phenotypes of patellofemoral pain syndrome. The prevalence of patellofemoral pain is high with a high rate of chronicity and recurrence and an overrepresentation of young, athletic and female populations. There are multiple classifications of patellofemoral pain syndrome. A pragmatic classification distinguishes 3 main clinical phenotypes of patellofemoral pain syndrome: with objectively displaceable patella, with extra-patellar alignment problems and without alignment problems.  The pathophysiology of patellofemoral pain syndrome is multifactorial involving static and dynamic dysfunctions of the hip, knee and foot, which remain incompletely elucidated to date. The links between the clinical and biomechanical aspects are still unclear and the kinematic and neuromuscular deficiencies associated with the 3 main clinical phenotypes are poorly understood. A validated non-invasive device allows the 3D evaluation of femorotibial rotations during walking.

Evaluation of Postoperative Quality of Recovery Score in Radical Prostatectomy With Erector Spinae Plane Block Radical prostatectomy is performed with a median incision below the umbilicus. Although the position is supine, the waist extension movement is created in order to facilitate access to the surgical site. The investigator think that this may be a factor affecting the postoperative comfort, not only in the pain in the surgical field, but especially in patients with low back pain (facet joint pain, etc.). Techniques that provide quality postoperative recovery with reduced morbidity and rapid return to daily activities are important for anesthesiologists.  In this study, the investigator aimed to evaluate the postoperative recovery quality (Quality of Recovery score (QoR-40)) of patients who underwent open radical prostatectomy and underwent erector spina plan block and wound infiltration for postoperative analgesia.
LONsurf and G-CSF Use: Being On A Right Dose-intensity to Optimize Treatment Efficacy Prospective cohort of patients treated with trifluridine/tipiracil, maximal sample size 250 patients. It is expected, that 89 patients will experience a grade 3-4 neutropenia and will be included in the phase II.
Influence of Weight Loss or Exercise on Cartilage in Obese Knee Osteoarthritis Patients Obesity and osteoarthritis (OA) co-exist in an increasing part of the population.  The two diseases intertwine in several ways. The evolution in the population shows a tendency towards deterioration of both by increasing general age and weight. The two diseases share pathogenetic features and the development of one disease increases the risk of the other and may be the onset of a vicious circle.  There is a link between treatments of these two diseases as well. There is now solid (gold) evidence that by treating effectively the obesity of patients with co-occurring OA, the functional status is dramatically ameliorated; the short-term results are equal to that of a joint replacement. The long-term efficacy of a weight loss remains to be shown. OA is definitely one of many diseases in which obesity must be taken seriously into account when planning a correct treatment of patients. This trial has two phases, the first (16 weeks) consisting of a dietary intervention with low-energy diet and the second (52 weeks) a randomized, three group (each n\>50 patients) controlled study of maintenance of weight loss by either continuing dietary instruction, exercise, or a control group. The hypothesis is that maintenance of an initially induced weight loss is dependent on attention rather than any specific therapy.

The hypothesis is that the new single-use flexible video-scope for intubation performs as well as the traditional scope.
Analysis of Patient Seeking Second Opinion Who Are Undergoing Full Mouth Orthodontic Treatment Patient safety is a great concern for the whole society. Since the investigators have a leadership in the medical field in Taiwan, the investigators should be courageous to face the reality from the patients seeking second opinions undergoing orthodontic treatment.  Orthodontics just became a recognized specialty by the Department of Health in Taiwan in 2009. It is just a beginning to set up the training course criteria at the national level. It will be a good timing for us to look at the treatment quality when patients seeking second opinions at NTUH. Whether the unsatisfied results are from the patient's unrealistic expectation, patient's compliance issue, doctor's diagnosis, treatment planning or skills, or a simple communication problem, depend on a good systemic analysis from the records and questionnaire collected in a timely fashion.  The investigators plan to ask patients who are undergoing full-mouth orthodontic treatment and seeking second opinion to join this study. The investigators will thoroughly explain to patients before they agree to take records and fill in questionnaire. Then the investigators use these records to perform root cause analysis.  Our hypothesis is that the risk of adverse event (AE) is related to the training quality, communication skills, patient's understanding and compliance. From these results, the investigators shall be able to assess the risk of AE and make the education policy either at continued education level or special training courses towards a patient satisfied treatment.
A Study of Chemoradiation in Combination With Tislelizumab as First Line Treatment in Participants With Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma This study is a multicentre, randomised, parallel-controlled, open-label, 3 phase clinical trial. The subjects were untreated, unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with low PD-L1 expression. Patients were randomly assigned to receive chemoradiation or chemotherapy in combination with Tislelizumab at a ratio of 1: 1. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We hypothesized that in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with low PD-L1 expression, chemoradiation versus chemotherapy in combination with Tislelizumab will significantly improve PFS.

The secondary endpoint indicators were: quality of life score (EORTC-QLQ-C30), nutritional risk score (PG-SGA, NRS2002), nutritional assessment indicators, changes in immune microenvironment, analysis of psychological status, survival time (1-year progression free survival rate), treatment tolerance (dose intensity, rate of treatment interruption, delay), etc.
Evaluation of the Use of Medical Scribes in VAMC Emergency Departments and Specialty Care Clinics Background and study aims: Medical scribes are trained paraprofessionals that assist providers with documenting patient encounters. Prior evidence suggests that scribes may be effective in increasing provider productivity and satisfaction, and decreasing provider time spent on documentation without negatively affecting patient satisfaction. Section 507 of the MISSION Act of 2018 mandated a two-year pilot of medical scribes, which will begin in March 2020 in specialty clinics and emergency departments (EDs) of twelve VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) across the country. The aims of this study are to understand how the introduction of scribes and scribe training affect provider efficiency, patient and provider satisfaction, wait times, and daily patient volume in the VA context.  Who can participate? Urban and rural VAMCs willing to be assigned medical scribes for use in EDs or selected high wait time specialty clinics (cardiology, orthopedics).  What does the study involve? Four medical scribes will be assigned to each of the 12 VAMC sites randomized into treatment with the VA hiring half as new employees and contracting out for the remaining half. 30% of the scribes will be assigned to emergency departments and the other 70% will be assigned to specialty care. Remaining sites that expressed interest in the pilot but were not randomized treatment will be used as comparators. Provider productivity, patient volume, wait times, and patient satisfaction from the treated sites will be compared to baseline (pre-scribe) data as well as data from comparison sites.  What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? VAMCs where medical scribes are introduced may see gains in provider efficiency, reduced wait times, and increased patient satisfaction due to the shifting of administrative burdens associated with documenting patient encounters in electronic health records from providers to these trained professionals. The introduction of medical scribes could complicate patient encounters by making some patients and/or providers uncomfortable.  Where is the study run from? This study is being coordinated by the Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center (PEPReC) at the VA Boston Healthcare System in collaboration with the VA Office of Veterans Access to Care (OVAC).  When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? March 2020 to February 2022  Who is funding the study? U.S. Veterans Health Administration

The Use of Furosemide in Patients on Dialysis Patients often begin dialysis taking diuretics (stimulate the kidney to excrete salt and water). Once on dialysis, these drugs are often continued. Whether these drugs are still needed, or even effective is often unclear.This study,by evaluating the composition of the patients' urine when off the drug, will predict which patients should benefit from the drug. By comparing their 24 hour volume both off and on the drug, the impact of the drug will be established. The results will allow the prediction of which patients, in the future, should take the drug. The hypothesis is: Among dialysis recipients, evaluation of the random urine sodium concentration will help predict the likelihood of a positive response to Furosemide, as manifested by an increased urine volume and sodium excretion.
The Obstetric Cook Double Balloon Catheter in Combination With Oral Misoprostol for Induction of Labor The current study is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial of Obstetric Cook Catheter combined with oral misoprostol for induction of labor in pregnant patients.

Secondary outcomes to be studied include the safety of the method, composite maternal morbidity and composite neonatal morbidity.  The hypothesis is that there is a higher vaginal delivery rate in the patient whom receive both the Obstetric Cook Catheter and the oral misoprostol.
The Treatment of Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Patients PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: To compare the combined rate of failure during therapy and relapse after therapy between two durations of intermittent therapy (6 versus 9 months) for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected patients. To compare toxicity, survival, and development of resistance in these two regimens.  ORIGINAL: To compare the efficacy and safety of induction and continuation therapies for the treatment of pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients who are either from areas with known high rates of resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs or from areas where TB is expected to be susceptible to commonly used anti-TB drugs.  PER 5/30/95 AMENDMENT: In HIV-negative patients, intermittent anti-TB therapy has been shown to be as effective as daily therapy, but the optimal duration of therapy in HIV-infected patients has not been established.  ORIGINAL: In some areas of the country, resistance to one or more of the drugs commonly used to treat TB has emerged. Thus, the need to test regimens containing a new drug exists. Furthermore, the optimal duration of anti-TB therapy for HIV-infected patients with TB needs to be determined.

Cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT for Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension in Hong Kong Hypertension (HT) is an important risk factor for stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure and renal diseases, and the leading risk factor of global disease burden. A multitude of interventions have proven efficacy in lowering blood pressure and reducing long term HT complications, including pharmacologic treatment, DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), exercise, weight reduction, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation and self-monitoring of blood pressure.  Objectives:  To evaluate long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Programme-for-Hypertension (RAMP-HT), a multi-disciplinary structured service to enhance quality of hypertension care in primary care compared to usual care  Hypotheses:  1. RAMP-HT is effective in reducing HT complications, based on previous results showing RAMP-HT was effective in improving patients' blood pressure 2. RAMP-HT is cost-effective  Design and Subjects:  Retrospective study of 5-year longitudinal data on matched cohorts of public primary care patients with uncontrolled HT under RAMP-HT and usual care will be conducted to evaluate long-term effectiveness and direct medical costs. Results from the long-term effectiveness and costing analyses will be applied to Markov modeling to determine the life time cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT.  Main outcome measures:  1. 5-year incidence of cardiovascular complications 2. Direct medical costs of RAMP-HT and usual care HT patients 3. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by RAMP-HT compared to usual care  Data analysis:  Cox regression will be performed to estimate the effect of RAMP-HT on the development of HT complication adjusted for baseline covariates. Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate costs of RAMP-HT and annual direct medical costs for HT patients. Markov modeling will be used to simulate 2 patient cohorts (RAMP-HT versus usual care) to estimate the respective lifetime direct medical costs and QALY gained/person. Cost/QALY of RAMP-HT will be compared to that of usual care to determine the ICER.  Expected results:  The results can provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RAMP-HT for primary care patients with uncontrolled HT, which can inform health policy and service planning.

Pattern of Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders Among Nurses at Main Assiut University Hospital The term work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) is defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO), as a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative diseases and disorders that result in pain and functional impairment. They arise when individuals are exposed to work activities and conditions that significantly contribute to their development or exacerbation, but which may not be their sole cause (1,2).  Another definition The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health defined WRMDs as "an injury of the muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, joints, cartilage, bones, or blood vessels in the arms, legs, head, neck, or back that is caused or aggravated by work tasks such as lifting, pushing, and pulling(3-5).  They represent the second largest cause of short-term or temporary work disability after the common cold (6).Apart from lowering the quality of workers' life and reducing the productivity, WRMDs are the most expensive form of work disability, attributing to about 40% of all costs toward the treatment of work-related injuries(7).  It is estimated that almost one-third of all cases of sick leave among health care workers are related to musculoskeletal disorders(8).According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 2013, WRMDs cases accounted for 33% of all worker injury and illness cases(9).  Most WRMSDs develop over time with usually, no single cause but various factors work in combination. According to the European Occupational Safety and Health Agency (EU-OSHA), the most common physical causes and organizational risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include:  * Prolonged sitting or standing in the same position * Performing the same task over and over * Continuing work while injured * Awkward and static postures * Load handling, especially when bending and twisting * Repetitive or forceful movements * Vibration * Insufficient work breaks(7,10-12).

A key component of HIV prevention for communities at risk is diagnosing HIV infections through regular HIV testing. A significant proportion of young Black MSM and transwomen have not tested in the prior year. This research study seeks to address low HIV testing rates among young Black MSM and transwomen by testing a brief Internet-based HIV testing intervention optimized for mobile devices. The intervention takes advantage of the variety of HIV testing options now available, including the HIV self testing, couples-based HIV counseling and testing and traditional clinic-based testing and will provide men and transwomen with a tailored recommendation of their optimal HIV testing approach. The investigators are conducting a pilot randomized study among young Black MSM and transwomen followed for 6 months to estimate the intervention's potential efficacy in increasing HIV testing.
Impact of Mixed Reality Training on Motor Skills in Children With Autistic Spectrum Disorder People with autistic spectrum disorder frequently present impaired motricity, or at least different motricity from neurotypical subjects (walking; postural balance; fine motor skills; motor control, etc.). Motor impairment can have impact on the performance and learning of simple tasks (bathing, dressing, writing, using tools, etc.), especially in children and teenagers.  These last years, new therapeutics such as Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality technologies have developed. Their therapeutic interest has been identified in various pathologies like phobia. However, their influence on motor skills has been little studied. The first results obtained with disabled adults described a significant increase in walking speed after a 3-month Mixed Reality training.
Immunogene-modified T (IgT) Cells Against Glioblastoma Multiforme This study aims to treat patients who have been diagnosed with brain cancer including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The treatment combines two different approaches to fight cancer: immune modulators and antigen-specific T cells. Immune checkpoint antibodies have been tested on various tumors with good outcomes. GBM is known to express increased levels of certain antigens that can be targeted by antigen-specific T cells. Thus, in this study, the gene-modified T cells specific for GBM antigens will be combined with immune modulatory genes to treat patients in dose escalation cohorts.
Cardiotoxicity in Locally Advanced Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Chemoradiation Therapy This observational cohort will evaluate the cardiovascular effects of chemoradiation used to treat locally advanced, non-small cell lung cancer.

Effect of Protein Composition on Gastric Emptying The protein composition of nutrition may affect the rate of gastric emptying and gastric fysiology. This is espesially important in children with neurologic impariment, who commonly rely on tube feedings, have feeding problems, nausea, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux and delayed gastric emptying. We aim to find out whether 4 different protein sources affect the rate of gastric emptying and electrofysiology in this group of children.
A Study Evaluating a Urinary Catheter With Different Activation Times for the Wetting Solution, in Healthy Male Volunteers. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the subject's perception (separately for each randomized catheter) of practicing catheterization when using catheters with sodium chloride in wetting solution (using two different activation times) with a standard reference catheter. The hypothesis is that the subjects' perception of catheterization is the same or more positive when using the test catheters compared to the reference catheter.
Targeting Central Pulsatile Hemodynamics in Chronic Kidney Disease Heart failure (HF) is an epidemic and is a major burden on the US healthcare system. The most common cardiovascular endpoint is HF. Thus, novel interventions to prevent HF in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are highly desirable. This study will assess: the variability in the response to isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) therapy; the degree of change in central hemodynamics and cardiac endpoints through analysis of changes in left ventricle (LV) mass, diffuse myocardial fibrosis, and myocardial systolic and diastolic function.

Data will be analyzed following a prospectively define plan and by intention-to-treat analysis.
Hepatitis B Reactivation During Treatment With Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents for Chronic Hepatitis C Infection Background:  Treatment of some diseases can suppress the immune system. This can cause other conditions to reactivate. Recent cases have shown that hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivates in people who had already recovered from it during treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Their treatment was direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents. Researchers want to see how common this reactivation is. They want to learn what the effects are. They will study data that have already been collected.  Objectives:  To study HBV reactivation in people with CHC and resolved HBV infection who are being treated with interferon-free DAA-based therapy.  Eligibility:  Data were collected from adults 18 and older in studies that were done in 2012 and 2016.  Design:  Researchers will screen the records from the previous studies. They will identify participants who had HBV infection before they got DAA-based treatment.  Researchers will take data from those records. This will include data on:  * Age, sex, race, and ethnicity * Treatment and disease status * Lab results  Researchers will test stored samples. They will test samples that were taken before, during, and after treatment. They will check if HBV was reactivated. They will also check if other clinical outcomes occurred.
Organ Protection by Remote Ischemic Preconditioning for Surgical Treatment of Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease Cardiac surgery is associated with risk of perioperative inflammation and ischemia leading to cerebral and myocardial morbidity and mortality. Ischemic preconditioning by repetitive ischemic episodes at an organ can reduce damage resulting from consecutive prolonged ischemia in that organ. Remote ischemic preconditioning is defined as ischemic preconditioning by repetitive ischemic episodes of an organ remote from the organ to be protected, e.g. ischemic episodes of a limb can reduce ischemic damage of the heart. Animal studies as well as human studies have shown that ischemic preconditioning can protect the heart from intraoperative ischemia. Remote preconditioning by repetitive limb ischemia has been applied in humans in some studies.12-14 However, the published data is not yet sufficient to support evidence based recommendations for clinical practice. In particular, available data regarding the influence of remote preconditioning on inflammatory and ischemic damage of brain and heart in children following surgery of congenital heart disease are limited. Hence, this prospective, controlled and randomized study was designed to perform remote ischemic preconditioning in children after induction of anesthesia for pediatric heart surgery and to investigate the effect on postoperative organ function in comparison to a control group.
A Comparison of Optical Coherence Tomography Guidance and Angiography-only Guidance for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold It is well-known that non-optimal stent implantation associated with under-expansion or incomplete strut apposition during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) leads to a higher incidence of restenosis and stent thrombosis. OCT-guided PCI with metallic stent has previously been shown to be safe and feasible, resulting in better clinical outcomes compared with angiography-only guided PCI. Everolimus-eluting bioabsorbable vascular scaffold (BVS; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was made from a bioabsorbable polylactic acid backbone which is coated with a more rapidly absorbed polylactic acid layer that contains and controls the release of the antiproliferative drug, everolimus. BVS has a number of proposed advantages over current metallic stent technology. These include elimination of chronic sources of vessel irritation and inflammation, which can reduce the potential risk of late scaffold thrombosis after complete scaffold bioresorption. Although the current generation of the Absorb BVS have larger strut thickness of 150 μm compared with 80 μm of strut of Xience stent, the acute recoil of the polymeric device was similar to that of metallic stent. However, operators tented to use dilating devices less aggressively because of the concerns about limitation in elongation-at-break of polylactide. Previous studies reported 20-30% of under-expansion or malapposition with BVS, which would increase the risk of adverse events including late stent thrombosis. OCT-guidance may improve more optimized scaffold placement and also better outcomes. Therefore, investigators will compare OCT guidance and angiography-only guidance for PCI with BVS regarding incomplete scaffold apposition and neointimal scaffold coverage. Investigators are also going to compare these two strategies regarding clinical outcomes with verification of the cut-off value by OCT-acquired uncovered scaffold rate.

FitEx for Endometrial Cancer Survivors The purpose of this study is to determine whether a physical activity tracking program called FitEx would be useful to endometrial cancer survivors. Each interested endometrial cancer survivor will recruit 1 to 5 additional friends/family members to participate in the intervention with them, forming a team.  Each team will be randomized to FitExEC (control group) that receives FitEx for endometrial cancer survivors, or FitExEC+yoga (experimental group) that receives FitEx for endometrial cancer survivors plus yoga cueing. FitExEC is based on FitEx, a program used to encourage adults to improve their fruit and vegetable intake while increasing their physical activity. FitEx works by having participants join a team with their friends and loved ones, so they can support one another in meeting their goals. In this study, teams of endometrial cancer survivors/support members will receive watches that track how much they walk.  Each day, participants record how much exercise, how many fruits, and how many vegetables they've eaten that day for a total of 8 weeks. Participants will be encouraged to attend a virtual session 15 minutes per week that will focus on 1-mile worth of exercise points (all control) or 15 minutes of yoga (all experimental) followed by 15 minutes of support (endometrial cancer survivors only \[control and experimental survivors in different groups\]).  Participation in the study lasts roughly 10 weeks, and participants will be followed for 6 months afterward. The investigators think that FitEx may help people with endometrial cancer improve their daily physical activity and slowly improve their health and quality of life. The investigators hypothesize this intervention is feasible and acceptable to Carilion Clinic endometrial cancer survivors.
Influence of Cola on the Absorption of the HCV Agent Velpatasvir in Combination With PPI Omeprazole. Epclusa® is a pan-genotypic, once-daily tablet for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection containing the NS5B- polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF, nucleotide analogue) 400 mg and the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir (VEL) 100 mg.  Velpatasvir has pH dependent absorption. At higher pH the solubility of velpatasvir decreases. It has been shown that in subjects treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, the absorption of velpatasvir is reduced by 26-56%, depending on the dose of omeprazole, concomitant food intake, and timing/sequence of velpatasvir vs. omeprazole intake. As a result, concomitant intake of PPIs with velpatasvir is not recommended.  For a number of reasons, the prohibition of PPI use with velpatasvir is a clinically relevant problem. First, PPI use is highly frequent in the HCV-infected subject population with prevalences reported up to 40%. Second, PPIs are available as over-the-counter medications and thus can be used by subjects without informing their physician. Third, although HCV therapy is generally well tolerated, gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and nausea are frequently reported, which my lead to PPI use.  One solution of this problem could be the use of other acid-reducing agents such as H2-receptor antagonists or antacids. In general, they have a less pronounced effect on intragastric pH, and are considered less effective than PPIs by many patients and physicians.  A second solution would be the choice of another HCV agent or combination that is not dependent on low gastric pH for its absorption such as daclatasvir. Daclatasvir, however, is not a pan-genotypic HCV agent and may be less effective against GT 2 and 3 infections than velpatasvir. Second, not all subjects have access to daclatasvir, depending on health insurance company or region where they live.  A third solution, and the focus of this COPA study, is to add a glass of the acidic beverage cola at the time of velpatasvir administration in subjects concurrently treated with PPIs. This intervention has been shown to be effective for a number of drugs from other therapeutic classes who all have in common a reduced solubility (and thus reduced absorption) at higher intragastric pH, namely erlotinib, itraconazole, ketoconazole.  The advantages of this approach are: (1) only a temporary decrease in gastric pH at the time of cola intake; the rest of the day the PPI will have its therapeutic effect (2) cola is available worldwide (3) the administration of cola can be done irrespective to the timing of PPI use.

The effective management is avoiding a spectrum of food and drugs causing oxidative stress. No data is available about the hazards of consumption of non-fava beans diet.
Partial Versus Total Fundoplication in the Surgical Repair of Para-esophageal Hernia. Short-term follow up after surgery of para-esophageal hernia comparing two different types of fundoplication
Effectiveness of Pretreatment Letrozole Versus Misoprostol Alone in Missed Abortion Background and Rationale Abortion accounts for about 8% of maternal mortality worldwide. Surgical intervention is the definitive treatment for abortion but it is invasive. Misoprostol, a PG E1 analogue, is exten¬sively used for induction of abortion with success rate less than 90%. Estrogen is important in the maintenance of pregnancy \& aromatase enzyme is essential for its production. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. So we assume that suppression of serum estradiol by letrozole will facilitate termination of pregnancy.  Objectives :  To compare the effect of a combination of letrozole with misoprostol versus misoprostol alone in successful induction of medical abortion.  Study population \& Sample size 150 women will be recruited. Women included will be \> 18 years with singleton pregnancy of gestational age ≤ 20 weeks having missed abortion. They will be excluded if they have prior CS, twin pregnancy, allergy to letrozole or liver problems.  Study Design :  A randomized controlled trial in which patients will be divided into 2 groups; case group \& control group. Each group will contain 75 patients.  Methods :  Case group will receive pretreatment letrozole 12.5 mg for 2 days while control group will receive only misoprostol. Both groups will receive misoprostol in a dosage according to the ACOG guidelines based on gestational age.  Possible Risk (s) to study population :  Major risks (Sepsis, considerable vaginal bleeding leading to hemodynamic instability or necessitating blood transfusion). Minor risks (Nausea, diarrhea, headache, weakness, hot flushes).  Outcome parameter (s):  Successful medical abortion i.e. complete abortion with no need for surgical curettage within one week from the 1st dose of misoprostol.

It also serves as a means to increase the skills of local health professionals working with the children in this study, while providing them with appropriate wheelchairs to use.
Comparison Between Dual Energy/Subtraction CT With MRI for the Identification of Predictors of Malignancy in Cystic Pancreatic Lesions Cystic pancreatic lesions are increasingly detected incidentally in imaging studies, reportedly in up to 45% of the abdominal Magnetic Resonance (MR) examinations. The majority of these lesions have potential to become cancer, therefore requiring surgery or imaging follow-up to monitor the development of features indicative of malignant transformation. Abdominal MR is the current standard of care for the follow-up of pancreatic cysts (PCs). However, MR is expensive and access is limited, In our institution, more than 35 MR studies for assessment of PCs were performed each month in 2015, placing a significant burden on the health care system that includes contributing to longer MR wait times for other indications.  The investigators will compare MR to two new computed tomography (CT) techniques - dual energy CT (DECT) and Subtraction imaging - with regards to their ability to detect features associated with increased risk of malignancy (enhancing septa and mural nodules) in PCs. For cases where there is disagreement between these 2 CT techniques and MR, histopathology of the surgical specimen or the results of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) will serve as reference standard.  Using DECT or Subtraction instead of MR for the assessment and follow-up of PCs would save significant healthcare costs and MR slots, which could be released to other indications and to reduce waiting times. Furthermore, if DECT and/or Subtraction imaging end up demonstrating to be superior to MR for this purpose, patients with cystic pancreatic lesions could have a direct benefit.
The Effect of Motivational Interviews on the Digital Game Addiction Levels of Nursing Students The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of motivational interviewing based on change stages on digital game addiction.

Feasibility and Functional Outcome of Laparoscopic Nerve Sparing Radical Hysterectomy The aim of this study is to assess:  1. Evaluation of the feasibility of laparoscopic nerve sparing radical hysterectomy type III/C1 as regard surgical technique, blood loss and operative time. 2. Evaluate patients' outcome as regard bladder function.  in order to preserve the function of the bladder and the rectum, it is necessary to modify the traditional procedures, so as to identify the precise anatomical information directing the technique for optimal preservation of bladder function at the time of radical hysterectomy.  The laparoscopic technique offers several well-known advantages. Under the magnified view of the laparoscope, the anatomy can be clearly visualized to allow for the meticulous and precise dissection of the para-cervical structures and areolar tissue, including the blood vessels and the nerves.  Laparoscopic identification (neurolysis) of the inferior hypogastric nerve and inferior hypogastric plexus is a feasible procedure for trained laparoscopic surgeons who have a good knowledge not only of the retroperitoneal anatomy but also of the pelvic neuro-anatomy as this qualification could prohibit long-term bladder and voiding dysfunction during nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy
Pre-analytical Factors Affecting ctDNA Analysis in Early and Locally Advanced Breast Cancer This study evaluates pre-analytical factors affecting circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) analysis in breast cancer that not spread beyond the breast and or lymph nodes (early and locally advanced). ctDNA refers to freely circulating tumor DNA fragments found in the blood plasma. Pre-analytical factors such as blood collection tubes, delays in separation of plasma, centrifugation speeds, storage conditions, shipping and DNA extraction methods can all affect ctDNA measurements. Inappropriate processing can cause breaking down of the membrane (lysis) of peripheral blood cells that release background wild-type DNA and may also cause degradation of circulating tumor-specific DNA fragments. Both mechanisms will dilute levels of ctDNA in plasma and make it more difficult to detect. Evaluating the pre-analytical factors of the collection of blood and left over tissue samples for the research of cancer may help researchers to evaluate the impact of the blood collection/processing and long-term storage from patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

Involvement of SK3 Calcium Channel in Taxane Neuropathy Taxane neuropathy is a common and long-term side effect of long-term morbidity in patients surviving cancer. No preventive or symptomatic treatment has been shown to be effective. Its pathophysiology is poorly known and probably multifactorial. A possible mechanism would be mediated by the activation of the SK3 calcium channel: a retrospective study carried out at the University Hospital of Tours (Carina RUA) found a significant association between the number of CAG triplets in the KCNN3 gene coding for the SK3 channel and the appearance of a taxane neuropathy.
Social Decision Making in Parkinson's Disease Impulsive and compulsive behaviors occur in up to 46% of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients taking dopamine agonist (DAA) medications. While these abnormal social behaviors have been studied in other neurodegenerative disorders, the true incidence of social problems, and the relationship to dopamine therapy, in PD patients remains unknown. This study is aiming to determine if dopamine agonists alter social decision-making and to determine if impaired social decision-making relates to dopamine-induced mesolimbic network dysfunction in PD patients. The protocol will include a screening visit, and on-DAA visit, and an off-DAA visit. For both the on and off DAA visits, participants will continue taking Carbidopa-Levodopa, but will withdrawal off of other PD related medications. Both visits will include an MRI, fMRI shock task, questionnaires to be filled out by other the participant and the caregiver, moral-decision making computer tasks, and the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II and III. For the on-DAA visit, participants will take Pramipexole. For the off-DAA visit, participants will receive a placebo. Participants will remind blinded to which medication they are receiving that day and will be counterbalanced such that all participants will not take the Pramipexole or placebo on the same days.

Diaphragmatic Myofascial Release in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease This study is a double blinded randomized clinical trial with two arms which aims to study the effects of diaphragmatic myofascial release in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  GERD has become in the last decades a common disease at the occidental world affecting between 10 to 15% of this population. That implies a high socio-health cost and the decline of the quality of life of those patients.  The diaphragm muscle surrounds the lower esophageal sphincter, and helps to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. If one or both structures become incompetent, it may appear GERD. Until the moment, the treatment for GERD begins by lifestyle modification, and if it fails, the treatment becomes medical and, in selected cases, surgical.  It exists some studies that have demonstrate that diaphragmatic breathing training can have a positive effect in GERD and the need of drug usage. But until the moment, the effects of a myofascial release of the diaphragm haven't been explored on these patients.  Thirty patients with GERD referred from different hospitals of Valencia will be randomized into two groups:  * Intervention with myofascial release for the diaphragm * Sham treatment group which is going to receive the same number of session treatments with the same manual techniques, but without the myofascial stimulus The protocol that will be applied consists of 4 identical sessions of myofascial release techniques aimed to normalize the myofascial tension of the diaphragmatic muscle. These sessions will be distributed in two weeks.  The study focuses on the analysis of the following variables:  * Frequency and intensity of the symptoms of GERD: Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) * Specific quality of life for gastrointestinal disease: Gastrointestinal Quality of life Index (GIQLI) * Drug usage: weekly milligrams usage of proton pomp inhibitors (PPI) The results of these pre-intervention and post-intervention variables will be compared between the two groups at baseline (first session), at week 3 and at week 6.
Teaching Healthy Responsive Parenting During Infancy to Promote Vital Growth and dEvelopment (THRIVE) Study Background. Unprecedented rates of overweight and obesity are seen in childhood1 with evidence suggesting that infancy may be a critical period for the development of this high weight trajectory. This has led to a call for proposals for "understanding factors in infancy and early childhood (birth to 24 months) that influence obesity development (PA-18-032)." Objectives. The current study seeks to recruit a sample of mother-infant dyads to pilot a responsive parenting focused obesity prevention program delivered by behavior and development specialists in pediatric primary care. Methods. Approximately 80 mother-infant dyads will be recruited in pediatric primary care at their newborn visit and randomly assigned to one of two groups: a) Healthy Growth (new intervention) or b) Healthy Steps (as usual). We will obtain assessments of growth, feeding, and sleep throughout the study period for infants across five clinic visits and at-home measure completion. Research clinic visits will take place at their regularly scheduled well-child check visits at ages 1, 2, 4, and 6 mos and in-home measures will be completed monthly. The intervention program is hypothesized to show efficacy in both breast and formula fed infants as measured by the primary (i.e., BMI percentile and BMI z-score) and secondary outcomes (e.g., awareness of infant cues, use of alternative soothing strategies, when it is not time for a feeding).

Cardiac Output Optimization on Postoperative Complications in Major Hepatic Surgery Major hepatectomies are high-risk surgeries offered more and more frequently for the curative treatment of primary or secondary liver cancer, and for complex cases, representing a real challenge for medical teams. The 1st peroperative phase of "hepatic resection" requires a minimum supply of filling fluids to limit perioperative bleeding (Low Central Venous Pressure). However this strategy exposes the risk of organ hypoperfusion due to low cardiac flow, secondary to hypovolaemia, which may lead to ischemic situations favoring the onset of postoperative complications. On the other hand, the hemodynamic management of the 2nd peroperative phase "post hepatic resection" is marked by the need to correct this hypoperfusion by optimizing cardiac output by suitable vascular filling.  The major challenge is thus to restore cardiac output by refilling without excess, by correcting the hypovolemia that arose during the "post resection of the hepatic parenchyma" phase.  Our hypothesis is that an individualized protocol for optimizing intraoperative cardiac flow by guided vascular filling during the "post hepatic resection" phase is accompanied by a reduction in postoperative complications in patients operated on for major hepatic surgery.

Exercise and Respiratory Training as Supportive Treatments for Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Hypertension Background  -Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with restricted physical capacity, limited quality of life, and a poor prognosis because of right heart failure. The present study is the first prospective randomized study to evaluate the effects of exercise and respiratory training in patients with severe symptomatic PH.  Methods  -Patients with PH on stable disease-targeted medication will be randomly assigned to a control and a primary training group. Medication will remain unchanged during the study period. Primary end points will be the changes from baseline to week 15 in the distance walked in 6 minutes and in scores of the Short Form Health Survey quality-of-life questionnaire. Changes in WHO functional class, Borg scale, and parameters of echocardiography and gas exchange also will be assessed.  Prospects  -We hope this study will indicate that respiratory and physical training are a promising adjunct to medical treatment in severe PH.

A Novel Training Simulator for Portable Ultrasound Identification of Incorrect Newborn Endotracheal Tube Placement First seconds after birth, new born baby go through physiologic changes to successfully adjust to the external environment specially establishment of independent respiration. Majority of the organ systems adaptation in newborns occur gradually, but radical and rapid cardiopulmonary adaptation must occur for neonates to survive. It is during this period that approximately 10% neonates require some level of support in the form of resuscitation.  A knowledgeable, quick and skillful response by all caregivers is crucial for extra uterine survival. Tracheal intubation is performed frequently in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) and delivery rooms. Neonatal intubation is a critical and time-sensitive procedure, and failure deprives the sickest newborns of oxygen.  Current methods to detect a misplaced esophageal ETT in newborns are suboptimal. Physical examination findings are often unreliable, exhaled carbon-dioxide testing is often unavailable outside of resource-rich facilities and can lead to false positive results ,while chest radiographs are not only time consuming ,labor intensive but also expose vulnerable newborn babies to significant radiation However portable ultrasound machines are relatively available even in small centers mostly being used in the maternity units, being an indispensable tool for managing obstetrics, gynecology and trauma cases.  POCUS methods of assessing ETT position offer an alternative that is time saving, cheap and safe, thereby of critical importance in the neonatal "time-is-brain" scenario.  Our project aims to demonstrate that POCUS can effectively and accurately detect esophageal intubations, and in shorter period of time than current standard-of-care methods that are colorimetric end- tidal carbon-dioxide (CO2) detector and chest x-ray.

The Role of 68-Gallium-DOTATATE-PET/CT in the Imaging of Metastatic Thyroid Cancer Background:  About 5% to 10% of differentiated thyroid cancers become resistant to standard treatment with radioactive iodine. In these cases, treatment options are limited and generally not effective. Researchers want to see if they can better detect thyroid tumors by using a compound called 68Gallium-DOTATATE. This compound may bind to a tumor and make it visible during a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. This information might help guide future research and treatment.  Objective:  To identify the people with thyroid cancer whose tumors have a high uptake of 68Gallium-DOTATATE as analyzed by imaging with PET/CT.  Eligibility:  People ages 18 years and older with thyroid cancer that has spread outside of the thyroid.  Design:  Participants will have a medical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. Some samples will be used for research.  Participants will have imaging scans that follow standard of care. These scans may include:  CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis  Bone scan  Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, spine, or liver  18-FDG-PET/CT as needed  Participants will have a PET/CT scan. They will get an intravenous (IV) line. They will get an IV injection of 68Gallium-DOTATATE. It contains radioactive tracers. The PET/CT scanner is shaped like a large donut. It contains crystals. The crystals pick up small radiation signals that are given off by the tracers. The CT part of the scan uses low-dose x-rays. The pictures made by the scanner show where the tracers are in the body. The session will last 90 minutes.  Participation will last for about 3 months....
Initial Patient Evaluation in the Emergency Department With Point-of-Care Ultrasonography Background: It is well known that emergency physicians can conduct ultrasound examinations as a supplement to initial physical examination. No previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the total findings with ultrasound on a broad unselected group of patients in the Emergency Department.  Aim: We aim to identify the pathology found in an unselected cohort of patients in a Rural Emergency Department. Secondarily we aim to quantify the changes done in treatment as a result of the ultrasound examination performed bedside in the Emergency Department.  Hypothesis: Supplemental ultrasonographical examination will change diagnostics and treatment in 10 % of an unselected cohort of patients in the Emergency Department.  Method: We will perform a structured ultrasound examination of 406 patients on an unselected cohort in the emergency department. All patients age 18 years and above presenting in the emergency department will be included in the study. Patients unwilling to give informed consent will be excluded from the study. Patients will be excluded if the ultrasonographic examination cannot be performed within the first two hours after initial contact with the treating physician. The study will be conducted in two substudies. Sub study 1 including all patient legally competent to give informed consent. Sub study 2 including all legally incompetent patients who cannot give informed consent due to acute illness. These patients will be included in the study under the rules of emergency research.  After including the patients we will ask the treating physician a series of binary questions regarding diagnosis and treatment plan.  Outcome: Primary outcome is the pathology found by ultrasound in the department. Secondary outcome will be the changes in diagnosis or treatment plan. Pathology and changes in diagnosis/treatment will be stratified according to initial complaint, triage level, age and other factors. This has never been done on unselected patients in the Emergency Department.  Ethical considerations and adverse effects: Ultrasound transmits high frequency waves into the tissue, which is reflected to the ultrasound probe. The time and magnitude of the returning sound waves are interpreted into picture on the screen. No adverse effects have been reported on the basis of the sound waves transmitted through the tissue.  Some patients might experience discomfort due to the sticky sensation from the application of ultrasound gel. Others might experience discomfort from the pressure applied to the probe under the imaging. Adverse effects, which we are not aware of, may exist. However, clinical ultrasound has existed since the 1950'ies and new adverse effects are unlikely.  Publication: All results will be published in international peer-review journals. Also in the event of inconclusive results.
Total Knee Arthroplasty With and Without Tourniquet: Comparative Study Tourniquet use during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) improves visibility and reduces intraoperative blood loss. However, tourniquet use may also have a negative impact on early recovery of muscle strength and lower extremity function after TKA.Seventy Patients are involved in this study and were divided into two groups; Group A (35) patients were treated with TKA with pneumatic thigh tourniquet. Group B (35) patients were treated with TKA without tourniquet. All patients were suffering from severe knee osteoarthritis and they failed to respond to conservative treatment so they are candidates for primary TKA. The two groups are matched related to age and gender. Selection of patients into two groups done randomly with regard of odd number for group A and even number for group B
Temperature Sensitive Release of PGE2 and Diminished Energy Requirements in Synovial Tissue With Postoperative Cryotherapy - A Prospective Randomised Study After Knee Arthroscopy Abstract  Background:  Local external cooling of the postoperative field is a treatment paradigm aiming for enhanced recovery after joint surgery. It is supposed to reduce pain and improve mobilization, enabling same day surgery.  Hypothesis:  Systematic postoperative cooling and compression after knee arthroscopy will reduce pain and also be reflected by changes in local levels of metabolic and inflammatory variables in the synovial membrane.  Study design:  Prospective randomised study; Level of evidence 1.  Methods:  Forty-four otherwise healthy patients were included in the study and randomised to systematic cooling and compression or NO cooling and compression after knee arthroscopy. Microdialysis of the synovial membrane was performed postoperatively with measurements of PGE2, glucose, lactate, glycerol, glutamate and blood flow (ethanol exchange ratio). Local temperature was monitored as well as postoperative pain (VAS and NRS).  Results:  The application of a cooling and compression device after knee arthroscopy resulted in significantly lower temperature in the operated knee (skin, joint capsule and intraarticularly).  The cooling and compression diminished energy requirements in synovial tissue and a 3 temperature sensitive influence on inflammation (PGE2) were shown. No effect on postoperative pain was detected.  Conclusion:  Local cryotherapy and compression after knee arthroscopy significantly lowered local knee temperature postoperatively. A correlation with synovial PGE 2 and temperature was shown.  Since PGE2 is a pain and inflammatory marker this implicates a positive anti-inflammatory effect induced by postoperative local cooling and compression. Hypothermia is proposed to have a protective effect in ischemic tissue. This is probably due to a decreased metabolic rate and therefore decreased energy requirements as shown by stable levels of lactate despite lower blood flow indicated by increasing ethanol ratio.

Ultrasound-Guided Erector Spinae Plane Block or Interscalen Brachial Plexus Block Following Arthroscopic Shoulder Surgery Postoperative pain is important following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and shorter hospital stay.Ultrasound (US)-guided brachial plexus blocks such as interscalen and supraclavicular block are usually performed. Interscalen brachial plexus block (ISCB) is one of the most preferred techniques among these.  The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is a novel interfacial plan block defined by Forero et al. Local anesthetic injection is administrated into the deep fascia of erector spinae. ESPB provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level, abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level, and lumbar analgesia at T10-12, L3 levels. There are a few case reports about the efficacy of ESPB for acute and chronic shoulder pain. However, there are no randomized clinical studies. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the US-guided ESPB and ISCB for postoperative analgesia management after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

An Oral Amoxicillin-Clavulanate Regimen to Prevent Bacteremia Following Dental Procedures Although controversy exists regarding the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk of infective endocarditis, expert committees continue to publish recommendations for antibiotic prophylactic regimens. Recently, the investigators have evaluated the efficacy of the intravenous administration of 1000/200 mg of amoxicillin/clavulanate for the prevention of bacteraemia following dental extractions. The results of this study suggest that is highly effective, and that it might be considered a first-line choice for patients at high-risk for infective endocarditis who undergo dental procedures and for whom antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended. This new project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate in preventing post-dental extraction bloodstream infection.
Prevention of Weight Loss in Long Term Care Veterans Background: Numerous studies have shown that many LTC residents receive inadequate staff assistance with eating, which places them at risk for under-nutrition, dehydration and weight loss. Moreover, improvements in feeding assistance care have been shown to improve residents' daily food and fluid consumption and weight loss outcomes.  Objectives: The purpose of this program evaluation project is to train indigenous LTC staff how to improve nutritional care within the constraints of existing staffing resources.  Methods: A multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in one federal and one state VA LTC facility. Research staff collected baseline measures related to nutritional care processes and resident outcomes. All LTC units in each of the two sites were divided into two groups for program implementation. The program was implemented with staff and residents on the units in the immediate intervention group; while, the delayed intervention group remained in usual care and continued to be monitored monthly for all care process and resident outcome measures.  Status: This project ended 10/1/13. Five published papers resulted from this study.
Clinical Response to Rhinovirus Challenge Rhinovirus (RV) infections represent the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in children and adolescents. The investigators hypothesize that the immune responses generated in the nose of allergic rhinitics and asthmatics underlie subsequent systemic modulation of the immune system, and that - in susceptible individuals (i.e., those with pre-existing asthma) - this modified nasal milieu is responsible for the asthma exacerbation.  Open label single center study in asthmatics as well as allergic rhinitis (AR) and healthy controls. All subjects will undergo good manufacturing practice (GMP) RV16 inoculation and responses will be compared between the 3 cohorts.
Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Stribild Versus Atripla in Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Type 1 (HIV-1) Infected, Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adults The objective of this double-blinded, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Stribild, a single-tablet regimen (STR) containing fixed doses of elvitegravir (EVG)/GS-9350 (cobicistat; COBI)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) versus efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF (Atripla) in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment-naive adult participants. Stribild offers an alternative STR for patients who are not candidates for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptor (NNRTI)-based STRs.  Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive Stribild or Atripla. Randomization will be stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or \> 100,000 copies/mL) at screening. After Week 48, participants will continue to take their blinded study drug and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded (Week 60), at which point all participants will attend an Unblinding Visit and be given the option to participate in an open-label rollover extension (the extension is scheduled to be open until Stribild becomes commercially available, or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate the study).

Therefore, aim of the study was to investigate whether or not the treatment of prednisone in addition to aspirin was capable of improving reproductive outcomes in euthyroid infertile women.
Is Verapamil In TransRadial Interventions OmittabLe? Background Verapamil is traditionally applied prophylactically in transradial procedures to prevent radial artery spasm. However, verapamil may have side effects and is contraindicated in some clinical settings.  Methods: During an investigator-initiated, randomized, double-blind trial, we evaluate the need for preventive verapamil administration. After vascular access is established, patients receive either 5 mg verapamil (n=297) or placebo (n=294). We compare the rate of access site conversions as primary end point using a superiority margin of 5%. Occurrence of code breaks (composite of conversions and unplanned use of verapamil), overall verapamil use, procedural and fluoroscopic times, contrast volume, and subjective pain are investigated as secondary end points.
Investigating Clinical Trial Participation for Acne Patients Participation in medical trials usually favors a particular demographic group. But there is limited research available to explain what trial attributes affect the completion of these specific demographic groups.  This trial will scrutinize the experiences of patients diagnosed with acne as they take part in a separate medical intervention clinical trial. The focus will be on tracking the rates of completion and withdrawal among these individuals.  It will also try to analyze data from the perspective of different demographic groups to check for recurring trends which might yield insights for the sake of future acne patients.
New Approaches in MRI at 3T Dedicated to Targeting Subthalamic Nucleus on Parkinsonian Patients Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a validated procedure, used in many French and international centers for the treatment of severe forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The improvement of parkinsonian motor symptoms by stimulation of the STN is 50 to 80% on average. The main advantage of DBS is that the surgery has low morbidity and mortality, it is adaptable to the patient's symptoms and its effect is reversible. This treatment is now a routine and more than 85,000 patients worldwide have benefited from the installation of this system. Since 1997, this treatment is available to patients followed in the Pitié Salpêtrière (GHPS).  The accuracy of preoperative anatomic targeting in stereotactic neurosurgery will improve with the use of high-field MRI. However, several new issues and inherent in that high-field MRI should be evaluated before the images can be used directly.  The chosen sequences must be short to be feasible, minimizing patient discomfort, and evaluated on several patients to ensure the low interindividual variability. In addition, the quality of the display on all of the sections should provide a reliable three-dimensional information. Finally, the quality of targeting and its possible improvement should be checked.

DexCom Hospital Study-CGM Directed Insulin Delivery This is a pilot investigator initiated/sponsored clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of using real-time DexCom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM or glucose sensor) trend data and an insulin-dosing algorithm to control the glucose levels of type 2 diabetic patients undergoing hip/knee orthopedic surgery at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH).  Blinded CGM glucose data will be recorded prior to hospital admission, during hospital admission, and after hospital discharge to evaluate glucose control in this diabetic patient population in relationship to clinical outcomes (20 days of recorded blinded CGM data maximum). Prior studies have associated hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability with an increased incidence of nosocomial infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrhythmias, mental status changes, hospital length of stay, and cost.  The 20 type 2 diabetic patients in the Control Group will be managed according to standard-of-care methods at TJUH using finger-stick blood glucose measurements in an attempt to maintain the patient's blood glucose levels in the desired target range (80 to 180 mg/dL). Three blinded CGM will be used to record the patient's glucose trend data for future download to a computer and analysis.  The 40 type 2 diabetic patients in the Investigational Group will be managed by the orthopedic floor nurses using the real-time DexCom G6 CGM trend data to determine the appropriate therapy to maintain the patient's glucose levels in the desired target range (80 to 180 mg/dL). In addition, three blinded CGM will be used to record the patient's glucose trend data for future download to a computer and analysis.  The primary objective of this pilot study is to observe the blood glucose values and glucose sensor (CGM) values of diabetic patients before, during and after hospitalization for hip and knee arthroplasty surgery to determine whether there is a correlation between glucose control and clinical outcomes. This pilot data will be used to plan a future clinical trial in orthopedic surgery patients using CGM to determine patterns of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability that correlate with clinical complications, hospital length of stay, and cost.

A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of SM04690 for the Treatment of Moderately to Severely Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis This phase 2 study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study of four concentrations of SM04690 (0.03, 0.07, 0.15, and 0.23 mg per 2 mL injection) injected intraarticularly (IA) into the target knee joint of subjects with moderately to severely symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA). Based on previous studies of SM04690, key phenotypes of laterality (unilateral vs bilateral) as well as chronic pain (as measured by the Widespread Pain Index) were identified as confounding variables impacting the overall assessment of both radiologic and clinical efficacy outcomes. The design of SM04690-OA-04 is based upon previous study designs while assessing strategies to combat the confounding impact of laterality and chronic pain. To evaluate the effect of IA vehicle injection on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) such as pain, stiffness, and function in OA, this study also includes one cohort that receives a 2 mL IA injection of vehicle (placebo), and one cohort that receives a sham injection (i.e., a needle stick with 0 mL vehicle injected).
The Use of Prophylactic Antibiotics In the Management of Dog Bites This double blinded RCT will help to ascertain the usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics in the management of uncomplicated dog bites, utilizing currently best available antibiotics (Augmentin) and an important clinical outcome of infection.  By enrolling 100-150 patients in this pilot trial as part of a k-award the investigators plan to utilize the point estimates of infection, side effects and other important outcomes and incorporate these into a cost most to determine the most cost effective management of these wounds and to determine if further study is warranted based on the findings.
Postpartum Family Planning Program in Rwanda This trial wants to address high unmet need for postpartum family planning (PPFP) in Rwanda. A previous pilot study tested the intervention (informed by formative work with couples/clients, clinic providers, champions, and community health workers), which significantly increased the use of PPFP in government clinics. This study now proposes to use an implementation science framework to test the hypothesis that the proposed PPFP intervention is adaptable to large-scale implementation, cost-effective, and sustainable. This PPFP could dramatically reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion and improve birth spacing and maternal and newborn health.
MR Imaging of Diffuse Myocardial Fibrosis in Transfusion-Dependent Anemias Cardiac failure is the major cause of death in patients with thalassemia and chronic blood transfusion-related iron overload. The treatment of thalassemia has been revolutionized over the past decade with the implementation of cardiac MRI based assessment of iron overload. This has enabled detection of cardiac iron overload prior to symptomatic heart failure and now allows for timely therapy which has resulted in a substantial decrease in mortality. However, currently implemented MR imaging techniques assess for iron content only and not for iron related diffuse fibrosis which play a role in iron related heart failure. Histopathologic studies indicate that patients with iron overload have diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Quantitative MR techniques have shown that patients with various cardiomyopathies demonstrate diffuse myocardial fibrosis and that these changes correlate with changes in cardiac function. The investigators propose that quantitative cardiac MRI for assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis can further improve our ability to detect early damage to the myocardium and prevent morbidity and mortality from cardiac iron overload. Detection of fibrosis in patients with thalassemia may allow for earlier identification of cardiomyopathy when compared to other techniques in clinical use including T2\* analysis. Identification of fibrosis could affect patient management as it would allow for tailoring of iron chelation therapy and may lead to better understanding of the disease processes contributing to heart failure and arrhythmia in these patients.
Vorinostat in Combination With Palliative Radiotherapy for Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer This is a dose escalation study that will assess the safety of Vorinostat, a Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in combination with palliative radiotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Vorinostat has been approved for use in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, but several pre-clinical studies suggest activity in lung cancer cell lines. Several HDAC inhibitors,including Vorinostat, may enhance the effect of radiotherapy, and this study will seek to confirm this.

In addition, this survey will generate data that will serve as comparator for the open-label study SNT-IV-006.
Economic Mobility Pilot Research on economic mobility barriers consistently demonstrates that lack of access to jobs that pay living wages and to asset building opportunities coupled with cliff effects across public assistance programs (families losing multiple benefits at the same time when their incomes increase) traps families in a cycle of poverty and food insecurity, and as a result, negatively impacts their financial well-being and physical and mental health.  The investigators will explore the extent to which an Economic Mobility Pilot improves the financial well-being, physical and mental health, and reduces the social risks of study participants. Study participants will be eligible consented Boston Medical Center (BMC) employees.  The intervention developed for this study consists of six months of coaching session offered by the Career Navigator. Participant will receive support on career and financial through services, such as career pathway navigation, employee benefit maximization, financial literacy, wealth building, resources, and referrals.  A step wedge design will be implemented with participants randomized in two groups, Group 1, and Group 2 - intervention on different timeframe, analysis of the difference and similarities between groups pre- and post-survey. The qualitative component will include focus group of participants to provide information on the employee's perception of the intervention received, barriers to adherence and facilitators, and semi- structured interviews of the employer leadership to help assess the barriers and facilitators of the pilot.  A primary aim of this research is to monitor changes in economic mobility and financial well-being. Additional aims are to investigate changes in household hardships and employee, employee depressive symptoms, and their child's health. The investigators will examine whether the participants in the intervention group compared to those before receiving the intervention, are more likely to:  * Increase employee retention and self-reported financial well-being. * Improve self-reported food security. * Improve housing stability, energy security, childcare access, and/or health care access. * Improve employee self-reported physical health status, and/or reduce self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms. * Improve employee-reported physical health status of the employee's child. * Cost of delivery of the intervention * Increased family income as result of this intervention
Smartphone Addiction and Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction in Individuals With Nonspecific Neck Pain It has been reported that excessive use of smartphones increases the stress on the cervical spine, and changes in cervical curvature and pain in the muscles around the neck are associated with the increase in stress. Studies have reported that smartphone users with addictions have neck pain (68%), upper back pain (62%), right shoulder pain (52%), left shoulder pain (46%), and right hand pain (46%). As a result of our study, the frequency of smartphone addiction and temporomandibular joint dysfunction and related factors in individuals with nonspecific neck pain were examined and the results we obtained will contribute to the literature.

e-PAT Neuromod Evaluation of Personalized rTMS for Resistant Depression Although repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective therapy for resistant depression, it still fail to remit up to 70% of these patients. We hypothesize that personalizing the procedure using functional MRI to better select dysfunctional regions and robotic coil placement to stimulate these regions homogeneously, will increase its efficacy. Individualized rTMS will be compared to traditional rTMS procedure and to trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).  In this small proof of principle study our primary outcome measure will be the correction of the MRI anomalies. Symptoms reduction and the proportion of remitters will be secondary outcome measurements.

Imaging Techniques in CT: Technical Development Background:  - Computed tomography (CT) scanning is a procedure that helps doctors with diagnoses. It uses X-ray radiation to produce an image in three dimensions. Researchers want to study how to get the best quality CT scans using the lowest possible radiation dose.  Objective:  - To determine how to improve CT scanning.  Eligibility:  - Adults 45 years of age and older who have not had a CT scan in the past year and do not have kidney disease.  Design:  * Participants will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests. * Nurses will put an intravenous (IV) line into an arm or hand vein. It will stay in for several hours during the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scans. Through this IV, blood will be taken, dye will be injected, and medicine will be given. * Participants may have a CT scan of the heart, head, chest, abdomen, and/or pelvis. Participants will lie on their back on a table. The table will slide into a donut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube will move around the body, taking pictures. * Participants may be given a drug called a beta blocker by mouth or through the IV tube. * Participants heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored. * Participants may have an MRI scan. The MRI is a large hollow tube. The participant will lie on a table that will be moved into the tube, which contains a magnetic field. When the imaging starts, a thumping sound will be heard. Headphones or earplugs will be provided to muffle the sound. * Participants will give blood samples.
Longitudinal Validation of a Computerized Cognitive Battery (Cognigram) in the Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease This research project will test two new computerized technologies in the detection of brain changes related to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. These technologies are:  1. Computerized cognitive battery: Cognigram (CG) Computerized assessments have multiple advantages for the early detection of subtle changes in cognition in older adults. One of their main advantages is their higher precision when measuring accuracy and speed of responses, compared to pencil-and-paper tests. They also allow a greater reliability in measures, as tests are given in a standardized format without the interference of an evaluator. Finally, by including automatized instructions and reports, they are suitable for off-site or long-distance use.     The present study aims to validate the Cognigram™ (CG) computerized cognitive tool, in a prospective and longitudinal fashion, determining if changes in the CG scores over 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, can predict progression to dementia at 1-year, 2-years, and 3-years, for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). 2. The NeuroCatch™ Platform (NCP)  Event-related potentials (ERP) are non-invasive, low-cost, electrophysiological methods that allow recording of the electrical activity of the brain in vivo through an Electroencephalogram (EGG). They are free from cultural and educational influence and can provide insights into the cognitive processes. ERP could enable to detect brain changes and determine the prognosis of MCI subjects.  The NCP, an investigational medical device system developed by NeuroCatch Inc., consists of an EEG software and hardware that captures brain health information. It offers a quick (i.e., 10 minutes for EEG preparation and 6 minutes for each task of EEG recording), simple (i.e., includes only 8 electrodes), and easy-to-use solution (i.e., includes a computerized software that automatically analyzes data and outputs graphs in less than 1 minute) for the acquisition of EEG and ERP.

ESS as a Diagnosis Resource Aid of the Syndrome of Obstructive Sleep Apnea The aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of the Epworth's sleepiness scale as a recourse aid in the diagnosis of the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea. 475 patients attended this study, that sought the CESF to probable diagnosis of some sleep disorder. The data were collected from records, wich are of questionnaires, including the ESE, prepared by the CESF professionals and responded, previously, by the own patients. The study compared the result obtained in the scale of Epworth with the data of polysomnography. The analysis of data was performed using the SPSS, based on descriptive and inferential statistics, being used the average considering the standard deviation, and, to the crossing of variables, was used the chi-square test of Pearson, considering as significant statistically values of p\<0.05. The results showed that gender, age and BMI are predisposing factors to SOSA.
Platelet-Rich Plasma Intra-Articular Injection in Treating Hemophilic Arthropathy Severe hemophilia is characterized by frequent and lifelong bleeding, with more than 60% of bleeds occurring into joints . Repeated joint bleeding leads to chronic synovitis, cartilage damage and bony destruction. Currently available treatment of hemophilic arthropathy, such as analgesics, NSAIDs, and hyaluronic acid (HA), are predominantly directed toward the symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation, but they do little to reduce joint cartilage degeneration.  Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) is a simple and minimally invasive method that provides a natural concentrate of autologous growth factors from the blood. This method is now being increasingly applied in clinical practice to treat musculoskeletal disorders, such as tendon repairment and osteoarthritis. To the best of our knowledge, no study applies PRP for arthropathy of knee joint in hemophilia patients. The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and duration of benefit of single PRP injection versus five weekly intra-articular injections of HA in patients with hemophilic arthropathy of knee.
Safety and Efficacy of Allogeneic NK Cell Infusions in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory AML and High Risk MDS This study involves the use of an investigational cell therapy known as DVX201. DVX201 is an investigational cell therapy that contains a type of white blood cell called natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a normal part of your immune system and have a lifespan of only about two weeks. They are called natural killer cells because they have the natural ability to identify and kill cells in the body that are abnormal, like cancer cells or virally infected cells. But fighting cancer can also lead to exhaustion and abnormal function of NK cells. It can also result in a significant decrease in the number of NK cells in the blood, making it more difficult for the immune system to control the disease. We believe that infusion of healthy, functional NK cells into patients with AML or MDS may boost the immune system and help by killing cancer cells that remain after chemotherapy. DVX201 is an investigational NK cell therapy that may provide a rapid and temporary source of healthy NK cells that are better able to fight those cancer cells.

Single- Versus Multiple-dose Antimicrobial Prophylaxis for The Prevention of Infectious Complications Associated With Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy(POEM) for Achalasia Peroral endoscopic myotomy is a novel, promising endoscopic technique for achalasia considering its minimal invasive characteristics and comparable efficacy to Heller myotomy. Numerous studies have focused on the efficacy, safety as well as technical aspects of POEM. However, few efforts have been made to the issue of antimicrobial prophylaxis in POEM. Postoperative prophylactic antibiotics are universally initiated on call to the operating room or at the start of POEM and consist of second-generation cephalosporins. The mean duration of antibiotic regimen after POEM was 3 days ranging from 1 day to 7 days.  Numerous studies have shown that a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis in a variety of surgical procedures. Other studies have shown that prolonged administration of antibiotics for longer than 24 hours add no benefit in many surgeries. Prolonged use of antibiotics not only increases the costs and exposure to drug toxicity directly but also may be associated with an increased risk of acquired antibiotic resistance as well as infection with Clostridium difficile.  Thus, investigators intend to perform a prospective randomized study to confirm the validity of single-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infectious complications following peroral endoscopic myotomy.
Darunavir/Ritonavir and Rosuvastatin Pharmacokinetic Study This is a phase I, open-label, controlled drug interaction study to determine the effects of darunavir plus ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, in HIV-1-seronegative subjects.
Topical Cyclosporine for Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) in Rwanda Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a bilateral, chronic, external ocular inflammatory disease of unknown cause. It is a fairly common disease in hot, dry environments, representing as much as 3% of severe ophthalmic diseases and up to 33% of all eye pathology seen among young patients in eye clinics in Central Africa. Symptoms and signs can persist for years with an important visual morbidity and social impact. Corneal changes (e.g. corneal ulcers) can be sight threatening, occurring in up to 10% of VKC children. Topical steroid therapy remains the current standard treatment, but in developing countries its use often is chronic and not medically supervised, potentially leading to bacterial infections, steroid-induced glaucoma and cataract. Chromoglycate drops have less side effects but lack the power to control a flare-up. Topical cyclosporine has the potential to offer an efficient but safer alternative to steroid drops in the management of VKC in an African setting. Its safety and efficiency in the management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis have been described in several uncontrolled studies and double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, but those studies were relatively small and involved populations outside Africa with predominantly palpebral and mixed forms of VKC. Controversy still remains on the efficiency of cyclosporine in severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis like VKC. We therefore undertake a larger prospective randomized double-masked, standard treatment controlled clinical trial in Central Africa to compare the short-term efficiency of cyclosporine A (CsA) 2% eye drops, solved in olive oil vehicle, with that of steroid drops in predominantly limbal forms of VKC. During 4 weeks the participants will be randomised to either cyclosporine or dexamethasone as attack treatment for VKC. The 4 weeks thereafter all participants will receive chromoglycate drops as maintenance treatment. Additional objectives are to document any difference in rebound phenomenon while on chromoglycate during the maintenance phase between the 2 treatment groups and to evaluate safety and tolerance of the test medication.

Detrusor Activity Recovery in Acute Traumatic Spinal Cord Injuries Determining the most appropriate time to evaluate detrusor activity in urodynamic studies for both traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injuries
Nutritional Supplements and Hormonal Manipulations for Breast Cancer Prevention The overall hypothesis is that the combination of a low dose of the antiestrogen Raloxifene with omega-3 fatty acids will exert a synergistic breast cancer chemopreventive effect due to the crosstalk of their downstream cellular effects leading to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of premalignant mammary cells. Based on the investigators hypothesis that upregulation of functional estrogen receptors in the premalignant lesions is also responsible for the development of hormone independent tumors, the investigators postulate that the combination of antiestrogens and omega-3 fatty acids will reduce the development of both hormone-dependent and -independent tumors. At present, there are no known interventions able to decrease the development of hormone-independent tumors, which are more prevalent, more aggressive, leading to the patient's demise. In addition, the investigators postulate that this approach will be safe since it will combine a lower and hence a less toxic dose of Raloxifene with the administration of omega-3 fatty acids which are known to have health benefits, i.e., reduction in cardiovascular risk, beyond their possible chemo preventive effect in breast cancer.

Digital Home-Exercise Therapy Application For Patients With Non-Surgical Knee Injuries Knee pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders in the United States. Conservative treatments generally consist of pharmacological agents and physical therapy. Unfortunately, such conservative care is often mismanaged, and little data is collected on clinical outcomes. The proposed investigation utilizes a novel and state-of-the-art mobile application (DETP) to guide an at-home exercise therapy program for non-operative knee pain. The purpose of this study is conducting a single-blind randomized, controlled, superiority study to compare the DETP to conventional physical therapy (PT). The investigators will seek to determine improvement in pain and function in PROMIS measures as the primary outcome. The investigators will also evaluate satisfaction with the application as a secondary outcome.
Continuing or Discontinuing ACE/ARBs in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Undergoing Coronary Angiography Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is a well-known possible complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with an incidence varies from 3.3% to 14.5% in patients undergoing PCI.  Many previous randomized and non-randomized studies have shown very conflicting results regarding the use of ACE-Is prior to coronary angiography, and whether it decreases or increases the risk of CIN. The importance of this study is to help find an acceptable and reliable answer for the use of ACE-I/ARBs prior to cardiac catheterization.  This research aims to study the effect of withholding ACE-Is or ARBs on the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography who have chronic kidney disease (GFR\<60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and to help build evidence-based data and guidelines on the safety of continuing or withholding ACE-I/ARBs pre contrast administration.

SELECT-LIFE: A Research Study Looking at Long-term Effects of Semaglutide in People Who Took Part in the SELECT Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial Participants are being asked to participate in SELECT-LIFE study because participants take part in the SELECT trial.  SELECT-LIFE study is a survey-based study that will start when the SELECT trial ends.  SELECT-LIFE looks at the long-term effects of participants taking part in the SELECT trial including the trial medicine participants have been taking.  When the SELECT trial ends, participants will no longer get the medicine participants got in the study, even if participants decide to take part in the SELECT-LIFE study.  Participants will not get any specific treatment or medicine as part of the SELECT-LIFE study, and participants will be treated as participants normally would by their own doctor.  The SELECT-LIFE study will last for up to 10 years after SELECT trial ends, and participants will be asked to fill in a questionnaire about their health every 6 months.

Labor Pain and Postpartum Behavioral Health Outcomes Study In this pilot prospective longitudinal observational study, women who are pregnant and who will be experiencing childbirth for the first time will be recruited at the third trimester and observed longitudinally for psychiatric and pain characteristics until 3 months postpartum. The primary outcome is postpartum depression, assessed by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Infants will also be observed for infant development characteristics over time. Women who choose to receive labor epidural analgesia will be observed, as well as women who choose to avoid labor epidural analgesia. At baseline, women will complete baseline surveys as well as a baseline pain sensitivity test (quantitative sensory testing, QST). During labor, they will complete an electronic pain diary delivered by a bedside mobile device. Three postpartum assessments will occur over 3 months to assess maternal depression, other psychosocial variables, and infant development.
Making SPARX Fly in Nunavut: Pilot Testing an E-intervention for Boosting Resilience Against Youth Depression The goal of this pilot trial was to test SPARX with Inuit youth in Northern Canada. SPARX is an educational video game designed to teach cognitive behavioural therapy strategies and techniques. This "serious game" has previously shown promise in addressing symptoms of depression with Māori youth in New Zealand. Researchers in this study tested SPARX's suitability with Inuit youth in the territory of Nunavut using surveys that youth completed before and after gameplay.  Hypothesis 1: Youth who completed SPARX were expected to experience a decrease in depressive symptoms and risk factors related to depression. Hypothesis 2: Youth who completed the SPARX program were expected to experience an increase in factors related to resilience.  A team of Nunavut-based community mental health staff facilitated youth's participation in this remote pilot trial with 24 youth aged 13-18 across 11 communities in Nunavut. These youth had been identified by community facilitators as showing low mood, depression, and/or significant levels of stress.

Mechanisms Underlying Peanut Allergic Reactions in TRACE Peanut Study Participants: Extension Study Food allergy affects up to 10% of the population. The mainstay of management involves dietary avoidance and provision of rescue medication in the event of an accidental reaction. The Integrated approaches to food allergen and allergy management (iFAAM) collaboration is an EU-funded academic/clinical/industry consortium with the aim to improve allergen risk management including food labelling. Much of this work requires the validation of the minimum 'eliciting dose' for the food-allergic population and how this can be translated into risk management.  A number of studies (including iFAAM and the TRACE study - NCT01429896) have assessed the eliciting dose for peanut allergic patients, using food challenges where peanut-allergic individuals are eat incremental doses of peanut under strict medical supervision.  In this extension study, peanut-allergic subjects will have undergone (in a cross-over manner) three double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to peanut:  1. incremental doses of peanut in a water-continuous matrix; 2. incremental doses of peanut baked into a cookie biscuit; 3. a single dose of peanut in a water-continuous matrix.  The differences in eliciting dose, symptom pattern and underlying physiological mechanisms will provide essential data on how the presentation and consumption of peanut affects the amount needed to trigger an allergic reaction, to inform industry and food regulators as to how to best protect the food-allergic population.

Implementation of Incredible Years for Autism and Language Delay Program in Spain Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) usually present coexisting problems in emotion and behavior regulation, similarly as premature children with communication or socialization difficulties. Caring for children with neurodevelopmental difficulties is an important stressor for parents. Therefore, it is essential that families are offered evidence-based interventions at an early stage within the public health service. Group therapy is a cost-effective intervention that can help parents of children diagnosed with autism and those born prematurely. The Incredible Years - ASLD program is an example of this sort of therapy, consisting of a group intervention for parents of preschool children with a diagnosis of ASD or Language Delay. In Spain, group interventions for children with ASD and preterm children presenting with Language Delay are scarce in the public health service. The Incredible Years - ASLD program has not been translated into Spanish and it has not been previously implemented in our country.  The Incredible Years - ASLD group intervention will be carried out in three public Healthcare centers. It is intended to recruit 72 patients diagnosed with ASD or premature children with communication or socialization difficulties, which will be randomized to an Intervention Group or to Treatment as Usual (TAU) Group. The Intervention Group will receive fourteen sessions of the Incredible Years - ASLD program in addition to Treatment as Usual (TAU). In terms of clinical implications, this randomized pilot study could demonstrate the feasibility of implementing this intervention in the regular clinical settings within the Spanish public health service and could be a first step for future controlled studies that demonstrate its effectiveness.
24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring in Patients With Blood Pressure Above Thresholds in General Practice High blood pressure (HBP) is a major modifiable cardiovascular risk factor which prevalence is gradually increasing. Reducing blood pressure (BP) significantly decreases cardiovascular morbi-mortality. Nevertheless, BP control remains insufficient: only 51% of French patients using antihypertensive drugs achieve the BP control targets.  HBP is mostly diagnosed and managed in primary care. Nevertheless, office BP measurements are unreliable for BP control and poorer predict target organ damage. Ambulatory BP measurements are recommended for HBP diagnosis and follow-up. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is the most cost-effective strategy. Its superiority has been demonstrated for HBP diagnosis and cardiovascular prognosis.  In France, ABPM is poorly available and little studied in primary care. Therefore, the investigators conducted a regional prospective study to analyze the feasibility and benefits of ABPM among primary care hypertensive patients in daily practice.
Effects of Wearing a Powered Ankle-Foot Prosthesis on Amputee Walking Amputees wearing a conventional prosthesis require 20-30% more metabolic energy to walk at the same speeds as non-amputees and this discrepancy is more apparent at faster walking speeds. Amputees choose to walk at speeds 30-40% slower than non-amputees. Preferred walking speed is likely influenced by elevated metabolic energy, but the underlying reason for slower preferred walking speeds is not fully understood. Unilateral amputees exhibit highly asymmetrical gait patterns that likely require more metabolic energy and impair functional mobility, increasing the risk of degenerative joint disease, osteo-arthritis and lower back pain. Improvements in prosthetic devices could enhance mobility in amputees, thus positively effecting rehabilitation and ambulation in veterans. A prosthesis that allows amputees to reduce metabolic energy would be especially useful for rehabilitation in older, ill individuals with reduced exercise capacities and could literally restore walking ability in people that are currently non-ambulatory.  Hypotheses. Amputees wearing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Powered Ankle-Foot (PAF) prosthesis will have a lower metabolic cost, faster preferred walking speed, and improved gait symmetry during walking than amputees wearing a conventional prosthesis and will have nearly the same metabolic cost, preferred walking speed, and gait symmetry during walking as age, gender, height, and weight matched non-amputees.
Efficacy of Hydrocortisone in Treatment of Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock Patients With Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Severe sepsis/septic shock is a serious condition associated with high mortality rate. Hydrocortisone has been recommended as a useful treatment to decrease mortality in hemodynamically unstable septic shock patients, not response to fluid and moderate dose of vasopressor. During the progression of severe sepsis/septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction can develop. Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) is one of the common organ dysfunction associated with septic shock. Information from a meta-analysis suggested that moderate dose of hydrocortisone may improve the ARDS patients' outcome. Whether hydrocortisone can effectively prevent disease progression and death in severe sepsis/septic shock patients who complicated with ALI/ARDS has not been proven.

Assess the behavioral and neurological benefits of AICAR in patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease.  III. Examine the effect of AICAR on purine production.
Vascular Dysfunction in Offspring of Assisted Reproduction Technologies The prevalence of infertility has been estimated at 9% worldwide. The steadily increasing use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) has allowed millions of infertile couples to have children. These children make up for 1 to 4% of the population in developed countries. ART involves the manipulation of early embryos at a time when they may be particularly vulnerable to external disturbances. In line with this concept, studies in mice suggest that ART alters the activity of enzymes involved in the regulation of metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis. Alternatively, infertility itself or the drugs used to stimulate ovulation may have adverse effects on the outcome of the offspring. The safety of ART for long-term health is, therefore, of utmost importance. Among the potential long-term consequences of ART, cardiovascular disease may represent an important candidate, but there is no information.  Investigators show that, children born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) present systemic and pulmonary vascular dysfunction at high-altitude when compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects. A 5 years follow-up study shows that premature vascular aegieng persist and evolve to arterial hypertension. Arterial hypertension may induce cardiac dysfunction.  Therefore, the major goal of this proposal is to assess cardiac function in apparently healthy participants born after ART.
Functional Connectivity in Primary Focal Dystonia In this study we are looking at primary focal dystonias, including dystonias of the limbs, eyes, jaw or face, neck, and vocal chords. This study will use magnet resonance imaging (MRI) to see how the brain reacts while resting and doing a finger-tapping task.  The investigators will test the hypothesis that disturbances in functional connectivity within the motor, affective and cognitive basal ganglia networks in primary focal dystonia (PFD) underlie the motor and non-motor symptoms in this disorder.

The Impact of Multimodality Treatment on Physical Functions and Quality of Life in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Oral cancer (including the lip) alone, with 300.373 cases worldwide in 2012, is the predominant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. With an incidence of 6.5 cases per 100.000, south - east asia has the highest incidence worldwide. Many of these cases do present at a locally advanced stage, which often requires combined modality treatment that includes extensive surgery to the primary site and neck and flap reconstruction. This is often followed by either adjuvant radiation or chemo-radiotherapy. This treatment can come with a significant morbidity affecting the self-care ability of the patients as well as impact the quality of life(QOL) (3,4).At the SingHealth Duke - NUS Head and Neck Centre 340 complex cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) involving flap reconstructions and extensive resections have been operated in 2014 alone. Almost all of these patients need further adjuvant treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Side-effects following such treatments, Significant number of patients underwent subsequent adjuvant treatment. The adjuvant treatment and surgery may render these patients weakness of the shoulder and neck muscles, numbness and reduced sensation around the neck and shoulder region and a general impact on the patient's fitness. While survival remains the most important outcome in oncologic treatment, recovery of treatment related morbidity and return to pre-treatment QOL for patients after cancer treatment is equally important.  The aims of this study is to evaluate the impact of surgical and adjuvant treatment on physical functions and QOL of the patients. By measuring the impact of extensive treatments for head and neck malignancies on the fitness and QOL of these patients, the team aims to identify the risk factors that necessitate a more aggressive rehabilitation. This is to date the first prospective study investigating the impact of multimodality treatment on fitness and QOL in HNC patients in a structured and predefined manner. Ultrasound (US) elastography will be used to assess muscle and soft tissue stiffness and elasticity and correlate these with functional outcome measurements. Elastography has been previously described as a useful tool to assess stiffness of the neck soft tissues and muscles, however no study thus far has correlated these findings with functional measurements. Hence this trial aims to establish the following:  1. Due to the limited available data: to quantify and qualify the impact of surgery as well as adjuvant treatment on the fitness, physical function of the neck and shoulder \& QOL of HNC patients 2. To establish a workflow and assessment protocol for a subsequent larger prospective clinical trial 3. To identify performance markers in these patients, that allow a more targeted rehabilitation process 4. Many patients post head and neck treatment are economically compromised since they are unable to return to mainstream work and there exists a significant unemployment rate. The understanding we gain through objective analysis apart from targeted treatment for every individual patient, in the future this study hopes to address and improve the economic impact to the individual and probably reduce the health care burden.
American Indian and Alaska Native Men Who Have Sex With Men HIV & Substance Abuse Research This is a pilot study of the feasibility of the virtually reality, online, culturally grounded HIV prevention intervention for Native American men who have sex with men. The project will include 90 Native American men who have sex with men (MSM) from across the continental United States as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  The investigators will use a randomized clinical trial with a waitlist control condition to evaluate the intervention's impact on HIV / Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) testing behavior, condom use, and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, investigators will ask participants to spend 3 weeks exploring a virtual reality environment hosted in the Second Life® platform. The island consists of 3 levels: Learning Level, Skills building level, and Experiential level.  In the Learning level the participant's avatar will have the opportunity to attend up to 2 free Motivational Interviewing sessions to establish their goals for their time on the island. Additionally, they will explore 4 learning paths each covering a knowledge objective: HIV Testing, Condom Use \& Condom Use Negotiation, Safer Sex, and Harm Reduction. Each path will present knowledge via videos, interactive games, stories, and teachings. After completing level 1, participants will move on to the Skills building level. Here participants will have the opportunity to role play scenarios (e.g., obtaining an HIV test, requesting PrEP from their doctor, negotiating condom use) with pre-program virtual actors. All scenarios are based on the knowledge gained in the Learning Level. Participants will also engage on mini-quests for additional knowledge and in-world rewards. Finally, in the third level participants will be able to practice the skills learned in interactions with other participants' avatars.  If efficacious, this online HIV prevention intervention has the potential for widespread dissemination and could be particularly helpful for rural and reservation-based Native MSM who often have difficulty accessing services and support.

Collection of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immune Plasma Background:  The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. In most cases, COVID-19 is a mild to moderate respiratory illness. But it can also be more severe and even lead to death. There is no vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also no therapy to treat COVID-19. Researchers want to collect plasma from adults who have recovered from COVID-19, which may help them develop treatments.  Objective:  To collect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune plasma from adult volunteers who have recovered from COVID-19.  Eligibility:  Males and females ages 18 to 70 who have a history of COVID-19 like illness or positive test for SARS-CoV-2, and have a minimum level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as specified by the study.  Design:  This study consists of 2 parts: 1) screening for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and eligibility to donate plasma and 2) plasma collection by apheresis. Study sites may participate in 1 part alone (either screening or plasma collection only) or both parts (screening and plasma collection).  For screening part: Participants will be screened for their eligibility to join this research study with a medical history and physical exam. Their vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiration rate) will be taken. Their weight and height will be recorded. They will give a blood sample for clinical laboratory tests of their general health and a research test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They will discuss their history of COVID-19-like illness and any testing for SARS-CoV-2. They will be evaluated for their ability to donate plasma.  For plasma collection part: Subjects meeting criteria for plasma donation and found to have high neutralizing antibody titers and who plan to donate plasma under this part of the study will be scheduled for 1 (and up to 20) plasma collection sessions. These will occur no less than 7 days apart.  Prior to each donation, participants will have a brief physical exam and complete a donor history questionnaire. They will be asked about any current SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms.  At each donation, plasma will be taken through a standard apheresis procedure. For this, blood will be withdrawn through a needle placed in the participant's arm vein. A machine will separate the plasma from the red cells. The red cells will be returned to the participant, either through the same needle or through a second needle in the other arm.  Participation may last up to 240 days.
Use of Phytonadione to Reduce International Normalized Ratio (INR) Variability in Patients on Long-term Warfarin Therapy Background: Warfarin is used as an anti-coagulant in patients at risk of developing thrombosis. It has a narrow therapeutic index necessitating close monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR). According to a meta-analysis, patients were in therapeutic range only 63.6% of the time. This increases the risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Various retrospective and prospective studies have looked at supplementation with phytonadione in these patients to reduce the variability of INR showing an improvement in variability. Most of these studies have only been done in a small number of patients already on warfarin therapy. This study will focus on patients newly starting warfarin therapy.  Methods: This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial performed at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital (JAHVA). Patients who meet criteria and sign informed consent will receive either phytonadione with warfarin or warfarin alone. Based on a power calculation for 80%, a total of 370 patients will be enrolled (185 participants in each arm). Participants will be randomized to either intervention or control. Intervention group participants will be prescribed their usual starting dose of warfarin along with 200 mcg phytonadione by mouth daily. Control group participants will be prescribed their usual starting dose of warfarin. Both groups will follow the usual standard of care. They will come in for a follow-up INR and warfarin dose titration at least once per week until therapeutic, and then as instructed up to every 6 weeks thereafter. Both groups will participate in anticoagulation clinic activities that constitute the current standard of care. Intervention will last for a total of 6 months for each participant once enrolled.  Hypothesis:Participants in the intervention group being supplemented with 200mcg of phytonadione will spend more total time with a therapeutic INR than participants in the control group.

The Physiological Effects of Human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG)Blockade on Metabolism The human ether-a-go-go-related gene HERG (encoding Kv11.1 potassium channels) is expressed in different parts of the body including the heart, pancreas and intestines. In the heart, Kv11.1 channels play a role in ending depolarization by causing repolarization. Loss-of-function mutations of HERG cause long QT syndrome, a condition of elongated QT interval that can lead to ventricular tachycardia, syncope and sudden death. Kv11.1 channels are also found in pancreatic α- and β-cells and intestinal L-cells, where they seem to play a role in the secretion of insulin, glucagon and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). Carriers of loss-of-function mutations in the HERG gene have showed increased insulin and incretin responses after glucose ingestion and decreased fasting levels of glucagon compared to matched control persons. Blockade of Kv11.1 has shown to augment glucose dependent insulin secretion and decrease low-glucose stimulated glucagon secretion in isolated α- and β- cells. The investigators of this study hypothesize that a blockade of Kv11.1 channels will increase incretin and β cell function and decrease α cell function and thus lead to lower glucose levels in humans after glucose intake. To investigate this, The investigators of this study will perform a randomized, cross sectional study of up to 40 healthy study participants who will serve as their own controls. The study participants will undergo two 6-hours oral glucose tolerance tests, one after intake of a known Kv11.1 blocker (moxifloxacin) and one control oral glucose tolerance test after intake of placebo. Prior to both tests the study participants will wear a continuous glucose monitor and on the day of the tests they will fill out a glucose questionnaire. Investigation of the physiological role of HERG in metabolism may provide a better insight on metabolic regulation.

Effect of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Visual Functions of Adult Amblyopia: a Preliminary Study Amblyopia, with a prevalence rates of 3% in adult population, is a common cause of vision impairment. It is characterized by impaired vision in one or both eyes because of disruption of normal visual stimuli and underdevelopment of the visual cortex, leads to lifelong visual deficits affecting both monocular and binocular visual function. Common causes of amblyopia include refraction error, anisometropia, strabismus and visual deprivation arising from ptosis or congenital cataract. Our previous studies had shed light on the relationship between abnormal early visual experience, and development of later amblyopia and possible neural developmental disorders. Functional recovery is difficult when neuroplasticity slows down at the end of the critical period. To date, there is no established effective treatment for adult amblyopia.  Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is one of the non-invasive stimulations had been used widely as a research tool to understand the brain functions and an established treatment modality in neuropsychiatric diseases. Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a newer form of rTMS protocol which have a major advantage over traditional rTMS in their reduced administration duration and allowing stimulation at significantly lower intensities to attain comparable effects. TBS had been demonstrated to able to improve functions in participants with visual disorders. However, studies of its use on adult amblyopia are scarce. Due to lack of efficient treatment at present, it is of scientific significance to conduct placebo-controlled experiments on this topic. Investigators will evaluate the effect of three regimens of TBS (intermittent, continuous and sham), after one session and accumulative sessions, on visual functions of amblyopia adults shortly after treatment and 2 weeks later (lasting effect), in order to evaluate its potential role in amblyopia and find out the best paradigm for amblyopia treatment.
The Value of Ultralow Dosis CT and Ultrasound in the Diagnosing of Pneumonia in the Emergency Department Pneumonia is one of the most common infections in the emergency department (ED). Nevertheless, the current diagnostic tools are often slow and inaccurate. Currently, a chest x-ray is the first choice for diagnostic imaging for pneumonia in the ED, but is inaccurate with low sensitivity and specificity, resulting in both over-and underdiagnosing of pneumonia. Alternatively, computer thermography (CT) and high-resolution CT (HR-CT) offers high diagnostic accuracy but involves significantly increased radiation to the patient, and increased costs and examination time. Lately, two alternatives to chest x-ray have emerged:  * The first is lung ultrasound (LUS) which has shown higher sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia than a chest x-ray when performed by experts. However, the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound performed by novice operators in the ED still needs investigation. * The second alternative to chest x-ray is ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT). A ULD-CT is a CT scan where the radiation dose is significantly reduced, while still maintaining acceptable image quality. In effect merging the high diagnostic accuracy of chest CT with the low radiation doses of chest X-ray.  The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of LUS by novice operators in the ED and the diagnostic accuracy of ULD-CT thorax, in patients suspected of having pneumonia.

Impact of Decision-Framing in Psoriasis Rationale:  Shared decision-making models between clinicians and patients are critical to improving healthcare delivery and adherence to medication. One type of model, decision framing, is rarely studied in medicine. Decision framing is the way that a choice is worded. In a clinical context, patient choices can be worded positively, or "gain-framed", to explain the benefits of a therapy or negatively, or "loss-framed", to explain the risks of not taking a therapy. Previous literature suggests that decision-framing can significantly influence patients' decision-making regarding their healthcare. However, a critical gap exists in understanding how decision framing affects psoriasis patients' preferences for therapies.  Objective:  Determine whether loss-framed messages lead to greater therapy acceptance as compared to gain-framed messages among adults with psoriasis.  Study population:  90 adults with psoriasis will be enrolled from USC ambulatory clinics and the general public.  Intervention:  Subjects will be exposed to gain-framed or loss-framed messages regarding psoriasis therapies. Specifically, gain-framed messages will explain the expected benefits of taking the psoriasis therapy and loss-framed messages will explain the potential risks of not taking the psoriasis therapy.  Study Methodology:  Cross-sectional single-intervention survey.

European Celecoxib Trial in Primary Breast Cancer It has been found that the chemical changes that take place in a patient's body during the development of inflammation may provide an environment which stimulates cancer cells. One step in the development of inflammation is the production of certain chemical substances which are important in the formation and spread of tumours. These are called prostaglandins. Cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) is an enzyme (a substance that speeds up chemical changes in the body) involved in the production of these prostaglandins and although it is not usually present in most tissues it is made at the sites of inflammation. Celecoxib is a selective Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) which works by blocking the action of the COX-2 enzyme, leading to a decrease in the production of prostaglandins and a reduction in inflammation.  The purpose of this study is therefore to find out if celecoxib can be used after breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy) to reduce inflammation and thus reduce the ability of new tumours to grow and survive.  2590 women with primary breast cancer will be recruited in this study from several locations in the United Kingdom and Germany. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated a treatment group, which can be celecoxib or placebo. Both treatments are taken orally (celecoxib 400mg daily, placebo 2 tablets daily) for a total of 2 years. In addition, hormone receptor positive patients will receive endocrine treatment as per local practice. Patients will prematurely discontinue treatment with celecoxib/placebo if disease progression is confirmed or if patients experience unacceptable toxicity.  Patients will be seen every 6 months for the first 3 years and then off treatment follow-up is carried out annually. Participating patients will also be given the option to take part in the pathology sub-study by donating a sample of the tumour tissue collected at the time of the primary surgery.

The Effect of Nitric Oxide on Spatial Working Memory in Patients With Schizophrenia - Pilot Study Spatial working memory (ability to remember where objects are in space) is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. It is thought that this impairment occurs due to problems with the chemical messenger (neurotransmitter), glutamate, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, particularly in the hippocampal brain region. NMDA receptor activation leads to increases in the release of the second messenger Nitric Oxide. Impaired NMDA receptor function would therefore be predicted to lead to reductions in Nitric Oxide production. Recent work suggests that a drug, sodium nitroprusside, which releases nitric oxide, enhances some aspects of cognition in schizophrenia (specifically related to negative symptoms). In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that sodium nitroprusside improves spatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia. 15 patients will receive sodium nitroprusside, and 15 will receive a nonactive compound (placebo). Their performance on a spatial working memory task will be tested before and after administration of sodium nitroprusside or placebo.

Observation Versus Surgical Resection in Patients With Rectal Cancer Who Achieved Complete Clinical Response After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy With the possibility of pathological complete response in surgical specimens, some authors have proposed non-operative management of the patient group, when re-staged after neoadjuvant treatment, have complete clinical response. So far, this approach remains discussed in the literature, and there are still many uncertainties that patients with clinical complete response after chemoradiotherapy in fact no detectable viable tumor and may be omitted of radical surgical treatment. It is a still investigational approach and actually gained space even for patients with very high or who refuse surgery after all clarifications surgical risk.  Hypothesis: The preservation of the rectum in patients with adenocarcinoma of the middle and distal rectum (up to 10 cm) reaching clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy have similar rate of the rectal cancer recurrence than patients who underwent surgical rectal resection.  This will be a prospective, randomized, open label phase II of surgical resection versus conservative treatment (observation) in patients with mid and distal rectal cancer who achieved complete after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with clinical response.  The main objective of this study is to assess whether conservative approach is similar to rectosigmoidectomy with complete mesorectal excision or amputation abdminoperineal the rectum in patients with complete clinical response after neoadjuvant therapy combined chemoradiotherapy.  Patient Selection: To be eligible patients who have neoadjuvant prior histologic diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma, tumors located within 10 cm from the anal verge, a complete clinical response after treatment with chemoradiotherapy for rectal tumors staged clinical and radiological T3-4 N0 M0 or T (any) N + M0, absence of colorectal synchronous tumors.  Treatment: Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to resection of the rectum or notice. The period for randomization of patients will be 12 weeks after the last dose of radiotherapy / chemotherapy, so that we can properly assess the antitumor response as described above. After randomization, patients in the surgical group will undergo resection of the rectum with complete excision of mesorectal within 2 weeks after randomization.

Patient Preference Study of Fluticasone Furoate and Mometasone Furoate Nasal Sprays The purpose of this study is to provide information on whether subjects with allergic rhinitis (AR) prefer the administration of fluticasone furoate (FF) nasal spray or mometasone furoate (MF) nasal spray based on how the products feel to the subjects when administered.  This Phase IV interventional study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, cross-over subject preference study to evaluate and compare patient preference for FF \[(total dose of 110 microgram (mcg)\] and MF (total dose of 200 mcg) nasal sprays in subjects with allergic rhinitis. These two commonly used nasal sprays use different actuation systems (FF nasal spray is side-actuated; MF nasal spray is top-actuated) and this study will evaluate whether this difference is reflected in the patient-assessed attributes of the two nasal sprays. The attributes or properties which are being assessed by the subjects for these nasal sprays include smell, taste \& aftertaste, drip down the throat, run out of the nose, urge to sneeze, and irritation.  The single-day study per subject comprises screening and all treatments and procedures. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a cross-over treatment schedule so that all subjects receive both products. One group of subjects will have two sprays of FF administered in each nostril whilst a second group will have two sprays of MF administered into each nostril. At 30 (± 5) minutes after the first study medication treatment, the two groups will switch. The first group will then have two sprays of MF administered into each nostril and the second group will then have two sprays of FF administered into each nostril. After each treatment the subject will complete two sets of attributes questionnaires ('immediate' and 'delayed'). A subject-rated 'immediate' attributes questionnaire will be completed immediately following each treatment and a subject-rated 'delayed' attributes questionnaire will be completed approximately 2 minutes after each treatment. Upon completion of the second set of these two attributes questionnaires (immediate and delayed), a preference questionnaire will be completed by the subject. In the preference questionnaire, the subject states their preferred treatment, if any, for each of the product attributes, and finally states their overall preferred treatment, if any.  There will be follow-up contact with the subject 24 (± 4) and 96 (± 4) hours after administration of the last treatment. The study is planned to enroll about 300 subjects.

The Effect of Integrated Prevention and Treatment on Child Malnutrition and Health in Mali: a Cluster Randomized Intervention Study Globally, child undernutrition is the underlying cause for 3.1 million deaths of children younger than 5 years. 18.7 million children under five years of age suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and an additional 33 million children suffer from moderate acute malnutrition, and are at risk of developing SAM  In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is often poor integration between programs to treat child acute malnutrition and programs that focus on the prevention of acute and chronic undernutrition - resulting in many missed opportunities for using prevention platforms to screen and refer SAM children, or for using screening and referral platforms to provide prevention services.  This project will address two critical gaps related to the integration of preventive and treatment programs: 1) screening and treatment of MAM/SAM have not yet been systematically integrated into routine health-center visits or mainstreamed into community outreach programs; and 2) screening programs do not offer any preventive services for those children found not to be suffering from MAM/SAM at the time of screening; mothers of children identified as non-MAM/SAM case are usually sent home without receiving any health or nutrition inputs and as a result, may fail to come back for screening because they do not see any tangible benefit associated with their participation in the screening. This project will specifically address these gaps by assessing the effect of an integrated approach consisting of higher screening coverage and preventive Behavior Change Communication (BCC) + Small-Quantity Lipid-based Nutrient supplementation (SQ-LNS) on both prevention and treatment of child undernutrition.
Pessary as Adjunctive Therapy to Cerclage for the Prevention of Preterm Birth Cervical cerclage was devised in the 1950's for women with prior early preterm births (PTB) who developed a dilated cervix detected by manual exam in the second trimester. In contemporary practice, there are three possible indications for cerclage. History-indicated cerclage (HIC) is defined as a cerclage placed usually between 12-15 weeks based solely on poor prior obstetrical history, e.g. multiple second trimester losses due to painless dilatation. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage (UIC) is defined as a cerclage placed usually between 16-23 weeks for transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) cervical length (CL) \< 25mm in a woman with a prior spontaneous PTB. Physical-exam indicated is defined as a cerclage placed usually between 16-23 weeks because of cervical dilatation of 1 or more centimeters detected on physical (manual) examination.  Randomized trials and meta-analysis of these have shown that UIC is associated with significant reduction in PTB and improved neonatal outcome, whereas evidence of efficacy for history-indicated cerclage and physical exam-indicated cerclage is limited. In the United States, the national data shows that the rate of cerclage has decreased in the last few years. The indications of placement of cerclage have recently changed, and so it is important to evaluate how many women are getting this procedure. With the recent completion of clinical trials, it is plausible that obstetricians and perinatologists may have become more selective in terms of the best candidates for cerclage.  The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of cervical pessary in prevention of PTB as adjuctive therapy in women with UIC

Natural History and Genetic Studies of Usher Syndrome This study will explore clinical and genetic aspects of Usher syndrome, an inherited disease causing deafness or impaired hearing, visual problems, and, in some cases, unsteadiness or balance problems. Patients with type 1 Usher syndrome usually are deaf from birth and have speech and balance problems. Patients with type 2 disease generally are hearing impaired but have no balance problems. Patients with type 3 disease have progressive hearing loss and balance problems. All patients develop retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease that causes poor night vision and eventually, blindness.  Patients of any age with Usher syndrome may be eligible for this study. Patients who have had eye and hearing evaluations are asked to send their medical records to the research team at the National Eye Institute (NEI) for review. They are also asked to have a blood sample drawn by a medical professional and sent to NEI for genetic analysis. Finally, they are interviewed about their family histories, particularly about other relative with eye disease. Patients who have not been evaluated previously have the following tests and procedures at NIH:  * Family medical history, especially regarding eye disease. A family tree is drawn. * Blood draw for genetic studies of Usher syndrome. * Eye examination to assess visual acuity and eye pressure, and to examine pupils, lens, retina, and eye movements. * Electroretinogram (ERG) to test the function of visual cells. Wearing eye patches, the patient sits in a dark room for 30 minutes. Electrodes are taped to the forehead and the eye patches are removed. The surface of the eye is numbed with eye drops and contact lenses are placed on the eyes. The patient looks inside a hollow, dark globe and sees a series of light flashes. Then a light is turned on inside the globe and more flashes appear. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina when the light flashes. * Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality. * Hearing tests to help determine the patient's type of Usher syndrome. Tests to evaluate hearing include examination of both ears with an otoscope, evaluation of the middle ear and inner ear, and hearing tests using earphones that deliver tones and words the subject listens and responds to. * Vestibular testing for balance function. Balance testing involves three procedures:  Videonystagmography: This test records eye movements with little cameras. First the patient follows the movements of some small lights. Next, while wearing goggles, the patient lies on an exam table and turns to the right and left. Lastly, a soft stream of air is blown into the patient's ears four times, once in each ear with cool air and once in each ear with warm air.  Rotary chair test: With electrodes placed on the forehead, the patient sits in a rotary chair in a dark room. Several red lights appear on the wall of the room and the patient follows the lights as they move back and forth. Then the chair turns at several speeds, all slower than a merry-go-round.  Vestibular evoked potential: Electrodes are placed behind the patient's ear and at the base of the neck. Seated in a reclining chair and wearing earphones, the patient hears a brief series of loud clicking sounds. When the sounds are on, the patient is asked to lift his or her head up a few inches from the chair. The electrodes record information from the muscles in the neck as the sounds enter the ear.
CytoSorb SAH Trial In aSAH high levels of IL-6 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) in the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as systemically have been linked to the severity grade and the occurrence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia caused by vasospasm as well as worse outcome independent of severity grade at time of admission and age. Increased levels of IL-6 increase the probability of unfavourable outcome, as well as the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  CytoSorb is an available, and certified medical device intended for use in conditions where elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6 exist. Its clinical effect lies in the reduction of levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and thereby improving organ function as well as improving hemodynamic stability within hours of treatment initiation. Currently it is primarily used for the treatment of patients with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure who have either an acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome, or a severe disease incl. respiratory failure, septic shock, and or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.  Until now, effective IL-6 removal in patients suffering from aSAH has not been possible in human and thus has not yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to see whether removal of IL-6 in patients with aSAH using CytoSorb is possible, and whether this alters the clinical course.  The overall goal of this study is to investigate whether a treatment with CytoSorb removes Interleukin 6 in patients with aSAH, and whether the treatment with CytoSorb alters the clinical course.
The Effect of Different Volumes of Physical Exercise on the Immune System The investigators will do an intervention on four groups of previously sedentary post-menopausal women which consists: group 1 - 30 minutes per day of physical protocol; group 2 - 50 minutes per day of physical protocol; group 3 - 70 minutes per day of physical protocol; group 4 - sedentary control women. The protocol consists of three sessions per week of concurrent training (half session with aerobic training and the other part with weight training). Inflammatory and oxidative parameters will be analyzed and the investigators hypothesized that 90 minutes per week of concurrent training (group 1) will reduce the inflammatory parameters and the oxidative stress, and this improvements will be greater so much as the longer the sessions (a dose-response effect). The physical activity practiced out of the intervention will be controlled by a questionnaire (the commuting and leisure sections of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and the food intake by a 24-hour food recall.
Orthodontic Varnish Microbiology Study Orthodontic treatment is common in teenagers, which typically involve the attachment of metal brackets to the teeth. These brackets often impede proper oral hygiene, leading to plaque accumulation and the development of white spots lesions (the early stage of cavity development). Our study aims to investigate the efficacy of different commercially available fluoride varnishes to treat these white spot lesions after the completion of orthodontic treatment and evaluate their effect on the oral microbiome.  Target enrollment is 120 subjects. The study will follow a split-mouth design, with each subject receiving different treatment on the left and right sides of their mouth. The subjects will be randomized into 3 groups, with each group receiving two of the following three options: placebo varnish, traditional sodium fluoride varnish, and a resin-modified glass ionomer light-cured fluoride varnish. There will be 4 total visits for this study:  Baseline (day 0): Oral health assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken, dental cleaning performed, DiagnoDent measurements taken, varnishes applied T1 (day 30): Oral health assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken, DiagnoDent measurements taken, varnishes reapplied T2 (day 90): Oral health assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken, DiagnoDent measurements taken, varnishes reapplied T3 (day 180): Oral health assessed, plaque collected, intraoral photos taken, DiagnoDent measurements taken, dental cleaning performed  Participants will be instructed to use regular fluoridated toothpaste and floss twice per day for the duration of the study.

Preliminary Outcomes of Sacral Neuromodulation Applications; Tertiary-Center Experience in Turkey to report our patients' outcomes of SNM in tertiary health centres in Turkey
Power Doppler Ultrasonography in Localization of Epidural Catheter Epidural anesthesia is a widely used method for pain relief which is useful in various settings. Identification of needle entry into the epidural space (EDS) is performed most using a loss of resistance (LOR) technique, which was described in 1921 by Sicard and Forestier, and has remained largely unchanged since. Hysterectomy operations anesthesia and analgesia rely heavily on proper needle placement technique. A noninvasive approach to confirm the correct position of the epidural needle prior to injection of local anesthetics into the epidural space, would thus be beneficial. Ultrasound (US) is a noninvasive approach increasingly used in anesthesia practice. The use of color flow Doppler (CFD) may further aid in defining the epidural space. The aim of current study is to detect and confirm site of epidural catheter in hysterectomy by using color flow doppler ultrasonography.

Hyperbaric Oxygen for Traumatic and Non-traumatic Brain Injury The purpose of this study is to examine whether 40 hyperbaric oxygen sessions has effect on long-term symptoms after brain injury. This study will enroll 90 individuals with persistent problems 6 months to 10 years after a brain injury. These individuals will be randomized to receive either oxygen or air in a pressurized hyperbaric chamber. Participants will receive 40 daily hyperbaric chamber sessions.  Participants will have a series of tests and questionnaires before they begin their chamber sessions, after they complete 40 sessions, and 6 months after they joined the study. These tests include computer-based and pencil-and-paper questionnaires and thinking tests, brain imaging, a neurological examination, and an eye exam. Participants will also be asked to provide blood for future research.  After the 6-month tests are complete, all participants will receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen sessions, then undergo the same tests at 9 months and 12 months.
Impact of Hand Osteoarthritis on Arterial Stiffness Patients affected by osteoarthritis (OA) have an increase overall mortality compared to the general population, mainly due to cardiovascular diseases. OA patients without cardiovascular risk have a 10 years cardiovascular events higher of around 15-30 %. Although the molecular mechanisms are still not well known, the structure and function of the vessel wall can be affected by several inflammatory and metabolic parameters during OA.These functional and structural changes of the arterial wall leads to arterial stiffness, measured by the pulse-wave velocity (PWV). PWV is the most widely used technique to assess arterial stiffness and has been shown to have predictive value for morbidity and mortality. In our study, we planned to compare arterial stiffness in OA patients with healthy subjects.

Pre-Anaesthesia CompuTerized Health Assessment Pre-anaesthesia assessment is an important component of preoperative care of surgical patients. With the increasing prevalence of same-day-admission and ambulatory surgery, patients no longer undergo preanaesthesia assessment as an inpatient in traditional "premed rounds". Currently, a nurse-administered paper-based health screening questionnaire is used at the Preadmission Service to identify patients who require outpatient evaluation by anaesthetists prior to elective surgery. In this study, the investigators aim to re-design and convert the current paper-based, nurse-administered health screening questionnaire into a reliable patient self-administered digital tool- Pre-Anaesthesia CompuTerized Health-assessment (PATCH). The electronic questionnaires will be validated by comparison of responses from digital self-administration against that obtained from a nurse interview structured to the same format. The investigators hypothesize that the responses obtained using PATCH will have at least 95% agreement with responses obtained in a nurse-led structured interview. Finally, the use of PATCH would be compared with standard nurse-led paper-based interview in a non-blinded, randomised controlled trial with regard to time taken for nurse processing of the patient at the clinic.

Effect of Lavender Aromatherapy on Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting Among Laparotomy Patients Post-operative nausea and vomiting are critical problems that occur commonly after the administration of general anesthesia, which can lead to serious health complications such as hemorrhage, electrolyte imbalance and ultimate shock. To prevent these complications, antiemetic drugs are often administered, but they can cause side effects as well as increased healthcare costs. As concerns regarding the side effects of antiemetic drugs have grown, there has been an increased interest in using non-pharmacologic interventions, such as aromatherapy, as an alternative approach to preventing post-operative nausea and vomiting. It involves the therapeutic use of essential oils, and lavender essential oil, in particular, is commonly used for various digestive problems including nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, a key question for a health care professional is how to prevent post-operative nausea and vomiting in best possible manner? To address this question, a study will be conducted in District Head Quarter Sheikhupura, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of lavender essential oil aromatherapy in reducing post-operative nausea and vomiting among patients admitted for laparotomy under general anesthesia. This study will be a Randomized control trial with the study population consisting of admitted patients after laparotomy under general anesthesia. The sample size will be 70, who will be divided into two groups, each consisting of 35 participants. A convenience sampling technique will be employed for the recruitment of participants. After that, the participants will be randomized into control and intervention groups by computer-generated table numbers in accordance with the inclusion criteria that is, 18-65 age, both genders, laparotomy under general anesthesia, clinically stable, and susceptive to post-op nausea and vomiting within 24hrs following the surgery. whereas, the patients with respiratory diseases, allergies, infections, reversal laparotomy within short duration, having any kind of addiction, those who move to the intensive care unit, those with a history of motion sickness, history of pre-op nausea and vomiting and those who start oral or NG feed before 24hrs will not be part of this study. The data will be analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.

Immunomonitoring After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative option for many hematologic malignancies, in particular acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes.  At the center of these reactions are the donor's T and NK cells. Several studies have highlighted the impact of T cells reconstitution on post-transplant infection rates, relapse and GvHD.  Most of the post-allogeneic immune reconstitution studies available to us today include young patients (\<60 years of age) who have had genoidentic or phenoidentic 10/10 allografts and mostly only study the phenotype of a limited number of immune cells. While it is important to know the absolute number reconstitution kinetics of the different categories of immune cells, it is essential to also be able to assess the function of the different cells. Knowledge of the restoration of T function at key dates after allogeneic stem cell transplantation would make it possible to adapt post allogeneic immunomodulation (immunosuppressive treatment and injections of donor lymphocytes) and anti-infectious prophylaxis for patients. The measurement of cytokine profiles after nonspecific stimulation of T and NK lymphocytes recently made available to the immunology laboratory of the CHU de Nice allows a routine assessment of T lymphocyte function (Th1, Th2 Th 17 and T regulatory) and NK by measurement of the secretion of different cytokines after stimulation of the patient's lymphocytes with different antigens (anti-CD3 and anti-TLR7).  The cytokine profile during immune reconstitution in hematopoietic cell transplants has never been evaluated; we will analyze it with regard to clinical data: relapse, infections and GVHD.

Intraoperative Assessment of Ureteral Perfusion in Women With Endometriosis Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is a severe form of endometriosis in which lesions affect retroperitoneal tissue and pelvic organs wall. It is often characterized by pain (dysmenorrhea, dysuria, dyspnea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain) and infertility, drastically impacting on women' quality of life. It is typically multifocal, involving uterosacral ligaments, the upper third of posterior vaginal wall, bowel, bladder, and ureters.  Indocyanine green (ICG) is an anionic tricarbocyanine molecule able to bind to plasma proteins into the vascular system and to become fluorescent if excited by near-infrared light (NIR). NIR-ICG imaging is used in gynecology for the intraoperative diagnosis of occult peritoneal and deep endometriosis at white light and to assess tissue perfusion and guide surgical strategy.

Subjects will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) omega-3 fatty acids plus inositol or 2) NAC.
AEEG in Pre-term Infants Amplitude integrated encephalography (aEEG) is a monitor that measures brain activity by attaching leads to a baby's head, and is used routinely in term babies who have brain injury because of a difficult birth. There is little information on how useful aEEG is in premature babies, and most studies only look at small numbers of babies. However, these studies suggest that the aEEG is different in premature babies with brain injury, infections / meningitis, and in those receiving certain drugs. It is also affected by changes in blood pressure and blood acid levels. It is theoretically possible that, if the investigators can detect changes using aEEG early on, the investigators will be able adjust treatment to make a baby better.

Patient Perceived Outcome After Total Wrist Arthroplasty With a New Total Wrist Arthroplasty Implant Total wrist arthroplasty (TWA) surgery has developed gradually and can offer patients with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis reduced wrist pain with mainly preserved wrist range of movement. Each year 60-70 patients in Sweden are operated with a total wrist arthroplasty. Several implants are available on the market and they all have different pros and cons. One risk with a total wrist arthroplasty is loosening of the implant. If an implant is loose, revision of the implant to another TWA is sometimes possible, if not, a wrist fusion is the likely alternative. Revision rates five years after the index operation have improved, however, they cannot yet compare with the results after a total hip arthroplasty. A newly designed TWA has been developed by the department of Hand Surgery, Örebro university Hospital, Örebro, Sweden, in cooperation with Trimed Inc. The newly developed TWA offers theoretical advantages and has been biomechanically tested at the Mayo clinic.  This is a pilot study where patients operated with the TWA will be assessed pre and postoperatively according to study protocol in order to evaluate outcome after TWA radiologically, clinically and regarding patient perceived outcome measures.

Chompions! A Treatment Study for Childhood Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a disorder that affects toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults. Individuals with ARFID are not able to consume an adequate amount or variety of food to a degree that it affects their mental and/or physical health. ARFID often begins in early childhood so it is important to treat children in early in life as possible to prevent any negative consequences of poor nutrition. There are currently no treatments for young children with ARFID. The investigators have developed two different study programs and the purpose of this study is to test them out and see if they help children with ARFID and to learn more about how these study programs work.

Pathophysiology of Diverticular Disease Colonic diverticular disease is a highly prevalent condition in Western populations. The prevalence increases age-dependently from 5% at 40 years to 65% by the age of 85 years (1-3). The majority remain asymptomatic. However, a significant proportion of the patient population develops complications, such as diverticulitis with or without symptoms (10-20%) (1, 4-10). Perforated diverticulitis is rare with an estimated incidence of 4 per 100.000 per year, but the associated mortality rate is 22% to 39% (9, 11, 12). In the United States, the complications related to diverticular disease account for 130.000 hospitalizations each year, resulting in substantial health care costs (13). In Europe, it is estimated that approximately 23.600 deaths per year can be attributed to complicated diverticular disease, and the mortality will probably increase in the future due to the aging population (15-17). Several case studies report an overall increase in the incidence of diverticulitis, based on the increase in hospitalizations (18). Kang et al, reported a 16% increased male admission rate and 12% female admission rate for diverticulitis, between 1989/1990 and 1999/2000 (19). Aging and the Western diet, low in fiber and high in fat, in combination with increased intraluminal pressure and alterations in colonic motility are considered important etiological factors. A disturbance in large bowel motility is suggested to be a common pathophysiological feature in IBS and diverticular disease (20, 21). Based on observations that IBD, subgroups of IBS and (symptomatic) diverticular disease share clinical symptoms, the hypothesis is derived that they might also share pathophysiological factors like low grade inflammation, changed microbiota composition and activity, and increased intestinal permeability. The identification of clinical and pathophysiological factors associated with an increased risk for complicated diverticular disease may help to identify patients with diverticular disease, prevent complications, develop strategies to improve quality of life and reduce the related health care costs. Therefore we aim to investigate the composition of luminal and mucosal intestinal microbiota and the intestinal permeability in the development of diverticular disease and complicated diverticular disease. We hypothesize that both the intestinal microbiota and intestinal permeability are altered in patients with (current- or previous history of complicated) diverticular disease.
Isometric Core Muscle Endurance in Healthy Active and Non-active Working Age Populations Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between core muscle endurance and participants' age in healthy adult population. Secondary purpose was to identify other dependent variables influencing isometric core muscle endurance (e.g. low back pain, physical activity, gender, body mass index).  Methods: 48 (35 females, 13 males) healthy adults (aged 21-66 years) performed 4 isometric core muscle endurance tests- Biering-Sorensen, McGill V-sit, right and left side plank. A correlation between core endurance and age, gender, lower back pain (LBP), physical activity level (PAL), and body mass index (BMI) was calculated.

Home-Based Telemonitoring Program for Functional Recovery and Symptoms in Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, or Gynecologic Cancer Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery This phase III trial compares a home-based telemonitoring program that collects symptom and daily step information to surgeon only care in improving recovery and stopping complications within 30 days after surgery in patients with gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or gynecologic cancer who are scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery. Patients may experience a decrease in functional capacity and experience symptoms like pain and fatigue after surgery, and this may change their ability to walk and function. Home-based telemonitoring of patient symptoms and their ability to walk and function after surgery may help doctors and nurses find and treat problems early, which may improve the patient's recovery and lower the number of complications after surgery.

Sorafenib for the Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) This is a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the activity of sorafenib in relapsed or refractory CLL patients with an iwCLL-WG indication to receive therapy.  Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor, which targets the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway as well as several receptor tyrosine kinases. It is FDA approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies in the investigators laboratory demonstrated that sorafenib is cytotoxic to CLL cells.  The primary objective of the study is to determine the overall response rate of Sorafenib in previously treated CLL patients. All patients will receive sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily continuously for three months and then assessed for response. Responding patients may elect to continue on treatment for an additional 9 months.
Comparison of Staple Line Suturing in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) involves the creation of small gastric reservoir based on lesser curvature of the stomach, which is fashioned by a longitudinal gastrectomy that preserves the antrum and pylorus together with its vagal innervation. Recently SG is viewed as a multi-purpose bariatric procedure that restricts the stomach size to induce satiety and resects fundal ghrelin-producing cells to decrease appetite. However, the risk of staple line leak and bleeding remains one of its challenging complications. Despite the fact that there are a large number of studies assessing various methods of making the staple line secure, there is to date, no consensus on which technique is best for reducing the risk of stapler line bleeding and leak. Hence, this study aims to compare staple line suturing reinforcement methods in sleeve gastrectomy using plication and over-sewing techniques.
LOADD (Lifestyle Over and Above Drugs in Diabetes) Study In the past, nutritional management formed the cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). More recently, this aspect of treatment has received less attention as drug therapy aimed not only to lower glucose, but also to treat raised blood pressure and blood fats (including cholesterol) has been more widespread. While there is evidence to suggest that blood pressure and blood fat levels have improved, overall diabetes control has not and people with diabetes appear to be becoming progressively more overweight, following trends in the general population. The proposed study involves a randomised controlled trial in which people with T2DM continuing with their regular drug treatment and surveillance, will be randomly allocated to additionally receive intensive advice regarding diet or remain on their usual treatment in this regard. The results will be judged principally in terms of body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose control and blood fats.

Psychology of Reward and Punishment: Functional and Molecular Brain Imaging and Monoaminergic Correlates Background:  * Brain imaging studies, genetic research, and investigations of stress have provided more information about the role of dopamine in processing reward and punishment, and in vulnerability to substance dependence. Researchers are interested in learning more about how the brain responds to rewards, including drugs of abuse, and how these responses may involve genetic factors or previous stressful events. * Researchers intend to use the drug amphetamine to increase levels of dopamine in the brain and study the effects through two kinds of scanning: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).  Objectives:  * To examine the relationship among dopamine function, brain activity, reward processing, genetic profile and exposure to stress in normal healthy adults. * To examine the variation in these factors between normal healthy adults and individuals with current cocaine-dependence.  Eligibility:  - Individuals 18 to 45 years of age who are either current cocaine users or healthy volunteers with no history of substance abuse or dependence.  Design:  * The study will consist of an initial evaluation session and six study visits, four of which will involve fMRI scans (3 hours each) and two of which will involve PET scans (8 to 9 hours each). * Cocaine-using participants will enter the inpatient clinical research ward at the National Institute on Drug Abuse Addiction Research Center the night before each scanning session and will be discharged the following day. Healthy volunteer subjects will not be required to stay overnight and will arrive as outpatients for the PET session. Participants will not be released until researchers have determined that participants are not experiencing significant effects of the drug. * Initial session (1): Participants will complete questionnaires about past reactions to stressful situations, and will be trained to do thinking tasks that will be performed in fMRI visits. The tasks will be practiced in a mockup of an MRI machine. * MRI sessions (2-5): Participants will receive either oral amphetamine or a placebo, and will perform thinking, short-term memory, and reward tasks during MRI scanning as directed by researchers. * PET sessions (6-8): Participants will receive either oral amphetamine or a placebo, and will provide blood samples during the PET scanning sessions. Participants will have short breaks during the PET scanning sessions.
Effects of Oral Levosimendan (ODM-109) on Respiratory Function in Patients With ALS This study will evaluate whether prolonged oral levosimendan can preserve respiratory function more effectively than placebo, resulting in better patient functionality as measured by the ALSFRS-R scale. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study, subjects are allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive either levosimendan (1 -2 mg daily) or placebo for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is slow vital capacity (SVC) at 12 weeks, with the impact on patient function assessed through 48 weeks, adjusted for patient outcome, using ALSFRS-R (combined assessment of function and survival, CAFS). Other important efficacy measures include time to respiratory events, clinical global impression (CGI), assessment of dyspnea using the Borg scale and sleep scales (Pittsburgh sleep quality index and Epworth sleepiness scale). Patient safety is monitored using conventional methods including adverse events, safety laboratory tests, vital signs and 12-lead EKG. Following screening and baseline visits, patients attend the clinic at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks, with telephone assessments conducted at weeks 18, 30 and 42. An end of study visit is performed 14-25 days after the last study treatment administration. The study will be monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. A long-term extension study will be available for patients completing the study.

The Use of Technology to Improve MS Clinical Trials and Patient Care Many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience "relapses" of disease activity during which they have increased numbness, weakness, visual problems, or other symptoms. If a person with MS has new symptoms that are concerning to them, their doctor may want to see them in the office in order to confirm that these symptoms are due to a true "relapse" of activity before starting relapse treatment. This requirement can be frustrating for patients, who may have to take time off from work or travel long distances for such unexpected doctors' visits. In this study, the investigators will use input from patients with MS and MS physicians to create a relapse questionnaire that can be used to confirm a relapse has occurred. The investigators will also evaluate if having a more direct line of communication with the provider's office improves overall patient care and satisfaction.

Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Miss-1 Study in Children and Adult With Nephrotic Syndrome MISSNEPHROTIQUE The nephrotic syndrome is a rare disease defined by a proteinuria \>3g/24h and a hypoalbuminemia \< 30g/L. Genetic and immune are the main causes. The acquired idiopathic nephrotic syndrome presents histologically minimal glomerular lesions, sometimes associated with segmental and focal hyalinosis. The idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) represents 85% of children's glomerular nephropathy and 25-30% of adult's.  Relapses are frequents, and can be pejorative up to 10% and lead to end-stage kidney failure.  Another immune cause is the extramembranous glomerulonephritis mediated by molecular targets specific autoantibodies expressed at the podocytes surface.  Other immune causes include lupus nephropathy, ANCA vascularitis, Goodpasture disease, Berger disease.  Easy diagnosis between these causes can be made with the renal biopsy.  Miss-1, a new protein activated during a inflammatory event, could be an actor in nephrotic syndromes by modifying the podocyte's adhesion on the glomerular basal membrane. This would modulate the structure and function of the slit diaphragm, as well as junctions between the podocyte and the glomerular basal membrane, regulating podocytes' apoptosis.
Effectiveness of Duspatalin® in Patients With Post-cholecystectomy Gastrointestinal Spasm Prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, observational program designed to assess the effectiveness of a 2-6 weeks treatment with Duspatalin® 200mg bis in die = twice a day (BID) and changes in quality of life in patients with post-cholecystectomy gastro-intestinal spasms
Improving Chronic Nocturnal Noninvasive Ventilation: a Multimodality Approach The aim of the data collection is to create an advanced reliable method to remotely monitor patient on chronic home non-invasive ventilation (NIV), both regarding ventilatory efficacy and patient comfort, both in the hospital and at home by assessing gas exchange, lung mechanics and the interaction between the patient and the ventilator.  For this purpose, we will set-up of databank of synchronously acquired datasets of already standard care monitored parameters during NIV (transcutaneous monitoring of gas exchange; ventilator data including data on PVA), and newly non-invasively acquired data on patient effort (EMG, patient ratings) and lung (hyper)inflation (EIT), during the set-up and follow-up of standard care chronic NIV.

Red Cell Distribution Width and Mortality in Adult Pneumonia Patients Abstract Pneumonia is a leading cause of severe morbidity and mortality among adults. During the last two decades, several scores were developed to evaluate the probability of morbidity and mortality among patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), such as the PORT score and the CURB65. Recently, several studies showed that elevated Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) could be used as a prognostic tool for predicting severe morbidity and mortality among patients with cardiac diseases.  RDW is a quantitative measure for red blood cell (RBC) size variability. Recent studies have suggested that high levels of RDW are in association with higher mortality among cardiovascular patients.  RDW has not yet been studied as a prognostic sign in CAP. The goal of this study is to examine the role of RDW as a prognostic factor for severe morbidity and mortality among patients who were hospitalized with CAP , independently to Hemoglobin levels, renal function and inflammatory markers.
Topiramate and Prolonged Exposure Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur, and having both disorders is associated with greater psychological and functional impairment than having either disorder alone. The most effective PTSD treatment, prolonged exposure (PE) is sometimes less effective when individuals also have AUD. Anti-relapse medication appears promising to improve the effectiveness of PE to help individuals reduce alcohol use and PTSD symptoms and improve functioning. This study compares PE with and without topiramate, a medication shown to both reduce drinking and PTSD symptoms, with the hypothesis that combined PE and topiramate will be more effective than PE and placebo. The aim of this grant is to improve treatment outcomes for Veterans with AUD and PTSD.

Examining Vascular Outcomes in COPD Inpatients (AIM 1) Examining Early Rehabilitation on Discharged COPD Patients (AIM 2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease primarily caused by smoking. COPD creates a tremendous burden to the healthcare system, as disease exacerbations result in frequent, prolonged hospitalizations. While originally considered a disease specific to the lung, data have shown that COPD is associated with substantial cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations of COPD requiring hospitalization result in marked patient deterioration, and heightened CV risk. The cause of the increased CV risk with stable COPD, and the exaggerated CV risk during exacerbations of the disease are unknown; however, it may be due to chronic inflammation which is exacerbated with a flare-up of the disease, and/or chronic inactivity which is similarly worsened with bed-rest during a hospitalization. Despite the impact of COPD on healthcare, there are relatively few studies examining how COPD inpatient care impacts on patient outcomes, inflammation and CV risk. Disease management programs, such as pulmonary rehabilitation and patient self-management education, are part of guideline therapy for COPD; however, these are not regularly implemented following a hospitalization, and how these interventions affect patient outcomes, behavior, physical activity, inflammation and CV risk have not been well studied. The proposed long-term project will examine how typical inpatient COPD care, and how early referral to chronic disease management programs after hospital discharge, affect patient outcomes. This grant brings together an outstanding group of researchers who have the necessary clinical, content and methodological expertise to successfully complete this work. These studies will provide invaluable information about inpatient and outpatient management for a disease which has a tremendous impact on healthcare.

LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY EVALUATION OF OCRELIZUMAB The study duration of 4 years was considered to be sufficient to show a reliable and relevant effect of ocrelizumab on disability progression in the main study (CONSONANCE). However, given the potential long-term use of ocrelizumab in patients with progressive MS, it is critical that additional effectiveness and safety data are accrued in this patient population. In particular, understanding how ocrelizumab can prevent or delay time to major disability milestones such as the need to use an assisting device (Expanded Disability Status Scale \[EDSS\] 6.0) or a wheelchair (EDSS ≥7.0) is of significant relevance, given that progression to such milestones is associated with a significant reduction in patients' quality of life and an increase in cost of treatment (Kobelt et al. 2017).  In the ORATORIO trial, ocrelizumab reduced the risk of 24-week confirmed EDSS ≥7.0 by 46% (hazard ratio \[HR\]: 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.92; p = 0.022) in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). To further characterize the potential long-term impact of ocrelizumab treatment on time to 24-week confirmed EDSS ≥7.0, an analysis was used to extrapolate the observed data into the future, estimating the time at which 50% of patients were expected to have reached EDSS ≥7.0. Extrapolated median time to confirmed EDSS ≥7.0 was 12.1 years for placebo, which was similar to the actual median time observed in MSBase (12.4 years), and 19.2 years for ocrelizumab, representing a 7.1-year delay (95% CI: -4.3 to 18.4) \[Butzkueven et al 2021\]. A recent MSBase analysis also showed that in a cohort of patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), 17.9% reached a confirmed EDSS score of 7.0 from the diagnosis of SPMS, over a period of approximately 12 years (Lizak et al. 2020). Therefore, following patients who complete CONSONANCE beyond the 4-year study period is justified, to better assess the impact of ocrelizumab on these long-term disability milestones.  Another important therapeutic clinical goal in patients with progressive MS is preserving upper limb function. Patients with progressive MS with high EDSS scores, including those who are wheelchair-restricted, experience a devastating reduction in quality of life if they lose any residual function in their arms and/or hands, as this affects the level of independence and significantly limits the ability to perform activities of daily living (Kraft et al. 2014). The Nine-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) has become one of the most frequently used measures of upper extremity function in MS (Earhart et al. 2011). A 20% worsening in test time is commonly used to define clinically meaningful worsening, as it corresponds to predefined clinically significant changes of established clinician- and patient-reported measures (Feys et al. 2017). Progression rates are lower for 9-HPT compared to EDSS or the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT; Goldman et al. 2019). Therefore, following patients who complete CONSONANCE beyond the 4 year study period is justified, to better assess the long-term impact of ocrelizumab on preserving upper limb function.  Patients with MS who have completed the CONSONANCE study, and have a favorable benefit risk ratio, as determined by the treating neurologist, can be included in this study if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  1.1. Study design  This is a 4-year, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study for patients who have completed 192 weeks of treatment with ocrelizumab in the CONSONANCE study (NCT03523858), and enrolled under the protocol version 1 of CONSONANCE. It is estimated that the study will enroll approximately 90 patients with progressive MS. The study will consist of the following periods:  1. Screening period: The screening visit should be scheduled up to two weeks before the first infusion of ocrelizumab, and always after the last visit of CONSONANCE at Week 192. This period should not be exceeded. 2. Treatment period: The first visit of the treatment period (first infusion of ocrelizumab) will occur at the baseline visit, which should be 24 weeks (+14 days) after the last infusion of ocrelizumab in CONSONANCE. Ocrelizumab will be administered every 24 weeks up to Week 168 of this study. The last visit in the treatment period will be conducted 24 weeks after the last dose of ocrelizumab (i.e., at Week 192).

Etiologies and Outcomes of Acute Respiratory Failure in Community Acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains a common reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). ARF to be present in 32% of patients on ICU admission, with a further 24% of patients developing ARF during the ICU stay. A total of 56% of all ICU admissions for a length of \>48 h had ARF at some point during their stay. The incidence of ARF was from 88.6 to 137.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents. The incidence of ARF was found to increase nearly exponentially with each decade until age 85 years. However, there is still paucity data about etiology and outcomes of acute respiratory failure happened in community.  Mortality of ARF in critically ill patients is between 40% and 65%. Independent hazards for ARF mortality include older age, severe chronic co-morbidities (HIV, active malignancy, cirrhosis), certain precipitating events (trauma, drug overdose, bone marrow transplant), and multiple organ system failure (MOSF) \[7-9\]. Mortality has also been associated with acute lung injury or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and with an elevated acute physiology score.  ARF patients form a large percentage of all ICU admissions and many factors might influence the final outcomes. With the high incidence of ARF in ICU, any improvement in the outcome of such population is likely to have marked effect on intensive care resource allocation. We wish this study may provide some valuable information about acute respiratory failure in community and improve the outcome of these patients.

Efficacy and Safety of the Neodymium Laser in Treatment of Urogenital Tract Diseases in Women Study objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Magic Max neodymium laser in the medical treatment of women with symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopausal, vulvar lichen sclerosus and pelvic floor muscle reduction.
Derivation of An In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Prediction Model for Patients in Intensive Care Unit Current studies have shown that hospitalized ICU patients have a high risk of IHCA, with an incidence of about 0.6-7.8%. Early prediction of the occurrence of IHCA in severe patients can provide early intervention, prevent the deterioration of the disease, and reduce the incidence of IHCA. Therefore, researchers wanted to verify the efficacy of MEWS, NEWS, and CART scores in predicting IHCA in ICU inpatients, and to establish an early-warning scoring model that could effectively predict the risk of IHCA occurrence in ICU inpatients during hospitalization.
Non-Invasive Spinal Cord Stimulation After Injury The goal of this study is to assess the function of the lungs and the muscles are used to breathe after individuals receive respiratory training, spinal cord stimulation, a combination of respiratory training and stimulation, a combination of arm training and stimulation, or a combination of trunk training and stimulation. The respiratory, arm, and trunk training combined with the spinal stimulation interventions are being used to activate the spinal cord below the level of injury. Investigators will be looking for changes in the function of the lungs and trunk muscles before, during, and after these task-specific and non-task-specific interventions for breathing to determine which one has the greatest effect. The results of this study may aid in the development of treatments to help individuals with spinal cord injuries that have impaired lung, arm, and trunk function.

Effectiveness of the Compression Belt for Patients With Sacroiliac Joint Pain The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the usefulness of the addition of a pelvic compression belt to a lumbopelvic stabilization program for patients with sacroiliac joint pain by comparing lumbopelvic stabilization exercises with a pelvic compression belt to lumbopelvic stabilization exercises alone. Outcome measures including the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (OSW), the percentage change of TrA and IO muscle thickness (i.e. muscle contraction from rest to contract) utilizing ultrasound imaging, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain, and a subjective rating of overall perceived improvement using the Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale will be collected. Hypothesis: The OSW scores and NPRS scores will be lower for those who receive the compression belt in addition to the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those who receive the lumbopelvic stabilization alone. The percent change of muscle thickness for the deep abdominals as well as the GROC scores will be higher for those who receive the compression belt in addition to the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those who receive the lumbopelvic stabilization alone.

Cognitive Aids for the Management of Deteriorating Surgical Patients Background and Goal of Study: Adherence to best practice management of emergencies improves through the use of cognitive aids. Aim of this study was to develop and validate cognitive aids for management of deteriorating surgical ward patients (CAMDS) in order to improve adherence to best practice and hereby reduce the likelihood of failure to rescue.  Materials and Methods: Fifty surgical teams will be randomly assigned to manage 150 standardised high fidelity simulation cases of deteriorating patients using the CAMDS or not. There are 10 standardised patient scenarios; pneumonia, pneumothorax, bradycardia, cardiac arrest shockable and non-shockable rhythm, bleeding, myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, sepsis and loss of consciousness. Two independent observers will score the team's performance in adhering to all the management steps. To assess perceived usability of the CAMDS participants will be asked about eight aspects of the CAMDS. These items will be scored on a Likert scale (0= strongly disagree to 4= strongly agree).
Radiation Therapy and Temsirolimus or Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective when given together with temsirolimus or temozolomide in treating patients with glioblastoma.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving radiation therapy together with temsirolimus to see how well it works compared with giving radiation therapy together with temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

This clinical trial will also evaluate the overall response rate and survival for both treatment arms.
Opportunities for Antibiotic Optimisation and Outcomes Improvement in Patients With Negative Blood Culture (NO-BACT) Patients with negative blood cultures represent 85-90 % from all patients with a blood culture taken during hospital admissions. This population usually includes an heterogeneous group of patients that are admitted because of an infectious diseases or febrile syndrome in which performing a blood culture is required. There is scarce evidence about the clinical characteristics and the antibiotic treatment given to these patients. This project will be developped in two phases with an specific target in each one:  * Phase I (a cohort study of patient with blood cultured taken): the investigators aim to analyse the clinical and therapeutics characteristics, outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship oppotunities in a population of patients with negative blood culture. The investigators aim to compare the outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship opportunities with those in patients with positive blood culture. * Phase II: The investigators will develop a cluster randomised control trial to evaluate the implementation of a targeted antimicrobial stewardship intervention in patients with negative blood culture (based on 3rd and 5th day audits). The effect of the intervention on the quality of antimicrobial use (duration and de-escalation), long of stay and mortality will be analysed.
A Cluster Randomized Trial to Assess the Impact of Opinion Leader Endorsed Evidence Summaries on Improving Quality of Prescribing for Patients With Chronic Cardiovascular Disease BACKGROUND: Although much has been written about the influence of local opinion leaders on clinical practice, there have been few controlled studies of their effect, and almost none have attempted to change prescribing in the community for chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or ischemic heart disease (IHD). These two conditions are common and there is very good evidence about how to best prevent morbidity and mortality - and very good evidence that quality of care is, in general, suboptimal. Practice audits have demonstrated that about half of eligible CHF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (and fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol targets). It is apparent that interventions to improve quality of prescribing are urgently needed.  HYPOTHESIS: An intervention that consists of patient-specific one-page evidence summaries, generated and then endorsed by local opinion leaders, will be able to change prescribing practices of community-based primary care physicians.  DESIGN: A single centre randomized controlled trial comparing an opinion leader intervention to usual care. Based on random allocation of all physicians in one large Canadian health region, patients with CHF or IHD (not receiving ACE inhibitors or statins, respectively) recruited from community pharmacies will be allocated to intervention or usual care. The primary outcome is improvement in prescription of proven efficacious therapies for CHF (ACE inhibitors) or IHD (statins) within 6 months of the intervention.
Lotta Alla Sepsi Ospedaliera - Fighting Hospital Sepsis Sepsis is widespread (1.8 million cases annually worldwide) and accounts for a very high mortality: 20-25% of all severe sepsis, 40-70% of all septic shock. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends a first 6 hours "resuscitative bundle" to improve patient's outcome. Despite this, the bundle is poorly performed, because of a superficial knowledge of the guidelines and several difficulties in their clinical implementation. In recognition of this, a "sepsis six" bundle is designed to facilitate early intervention with just three diagnostic and three therapeutic steps to be delivered by staff within 1 h.  The aim of our study is to evaluate if an Educational and Organizational Intervention (EOI) could improve septic patient's outcome in no Critical Care Units. The second endpoint is to evaluate if the compliance to the "sepsis six" bundle could improve after this sort of intervention.
A Study to Evaluate the Effects of Calcium Carbonate and Ferrous Fumarate on Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir in Healthy Adult Subjects Human immune virus (HIV) infected subjects may take mineral supplements in combination with their antiretroviral medications. Calcium and Iron supplementations are commonly used and both of these have the potential to interact with Dolutegravir (DTG), this study will evaluate the potential of calcium and iron supplements to decrease DTG exposure. It will also evaluate two possible strategies for combined use; if an interaction is observed. The first strategy is a two hour separation. The second strategy involves the administration of DTG and the supplement with a meal since the presence of food modestly increases DTG exposure, and because mineral supplements can be administered with food.  This is an open label, randomized, two cohort, four-period cross-over study in healthy volunteers. One cohort will examine the effects of calcium carbonate and the other cohort will examine the effects of ferrous fumarate on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of DTG. Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled into each of the two cohorts and receive each of four treatments in a randomized fashion: 1) A single dose of DTG 50 milligram (mg) administered under fasted conditions ; 2) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions ; 3) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate with a moderate-fat meal; 4) A single dose of DTG 50 mg administered under fasted conditions 2 hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center in the United States, with healthy adult male and female subjects.
TAK-875 Glimepiride Drug-Interaction Study The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety of TAK-875, once daily (QD), with and without glimepiride in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Azacitidine and Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced Lung or Head and Neck Cancer The standard of care for head and neck and lung cancer includes chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. For patients with cancer of head and neck or lung that recurs after surgery and/or radiation, or has spread to other parts of body, chemotherapy using cisplatin can slow down tumor growth and extend lifespan.  The study drug, azacitidine, can block the ability of some cancer cells to replicate, and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a slowly developing blood cell-related cancer. In laboratory and animal experiments using head and neck and lung cancer cells, azacitidine has been shown to be a cisplatin "helper", (that is, it makes cisplatin more effective in stopping the growth of head and neck and lung cancer. )  Since the combination of azacitidine and cisplatin has not been used in patients with head and neck or lung cancer, the investigators are performing this study combining azacitidine and cisplatin to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the study drug may have on patients with advanced head and neck or lung cancer. The investigators are doing this study because they would like to find a better treatment for these types of cancer.
An Observational Study to Assess the Prevalence and Outcomes of Primary Pulmonary Coccidioidomycosis in Persons Aged > / = 14 Years Presenting With Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) in Endemic Areas (SAnds-PPC) This is an observational study in 750 individuals aged 14 years or older, diagnosed with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility criteria in Coccidioides endemic regions. This study is designed to provide data on the prevalence of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis among persons presenting with CAP in endemic regions. Among individuals diagnosed with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, we aim to describe the clinical course, predictors of the clinical course and compare the response to prescribed antifungal therapy versus no antifungal therapy. The hypothesis for patients with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis is that early treatment with antifungal therapy is effective in reducing the frequency, severity and associated adverse outcomes of infection with recently acquired coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. The study will be divided into Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 will identify which subjects have primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis based on the case definition for the protocol and Step 2 will follow subjects who meet the case definition and will observe their clinical management and clinical outcomes. Subjects will enroll in Step 1 within 28 days of symptom onset. In Step 1, blood work for serologic determination of Coccidioides infection will be drawn at the time of enrollment (Day 1), and again 21 days later if a positive result is not reported at Day 1. Subjects with a diagnosis of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis confirmed by positive serologic testing during Step 1 will enter Step 2 within 21 days of a positive test result; subjects with a negative serology at Day 1 and Day 22 will not be followed further. Subjects referred to the study after a diagnosis of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis confirmed by positive serologic testing will also be allowed to enter Step 2 directly within 21 days of a positive test result and within 7 weeks of symptom onset, as long as they meet study enrollment criteria. The primary objective is to assess the prevalence of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis (PPC) in subjects with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in coccidioidomycosis endemic areas.
Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Gastric Cancer Gastric cancer associated peritoneal carcinomatosis has a poor prognosis with a median survival of less than one year. Systemic chemotherapy including targeted agents has not been found to significantly increase the survival in Gastric cancer associated peritoneal carcinomatosis. Since recurrent gastric cancer remains confined to the abdominal cavity in many patients, regional therapies like aggressive cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been investigated for Gastric cancer associated peritoneal carcinomatosis. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been used for three indications in Gastric Cancer- as an adjuvant therapy after a curative surgery, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival and reduce peritoneal recurrences in many randomised trials in Asian countries; as a definitive treatment in established PC, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy along with cytoreductive surgery is the only therapeutic modality that has resulted in long-term survival in select groups of patients. While the results of randomised trials of adjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy from western centres are awaited, the role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the treatment of Gastric cancer associated peritoneal carcinomatosis is still evolving and needs larger studies before it is accepted as a standard of care.

Efficacy and Tolerance of Peg-interferon Alpha 2a Added to Tenofovir and Emtricitabine in AgHBe Positive HBV-HIV Co-infected Patients HBe seroconversion is an important goal for anti-HBV treatment, since it is associated with a non progressive liver infection and a better clinical outcome. However, the rate of HBe seroconversion is low in HIV-HBV co-infected patients, mostly treated by tenofovir and emtricitabine. This study will evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a one-year Peg-interferon alpha 2a additional treatment in patients already treated by tenofovir and emtricitabine without reaching HBe seroconversion.
Impact of Reducing Colistin Use on Colistin Resistance in Humans and Poultry in Indonesia Colistin (polymyxin E) is considered a last resort antimicrobial for treatment of infections with multidrug- resistant bacteria, classified by WHO as 'highest prioritized, critically important for human medicine'. WHO suggests to ban or highly restrict its use in animals. In Indonesia, colistin resistance in human Escherichia coli isolates is poorly characterized as it requires specific non-routine tests. Presence of colistin resistance in E. coli in poultry resulted in a ban for livestock in Indonesia in 2020. However, colistin is still suspected to be routinely used in humans in multiple settings but the reasons for these practices are poorly understood. The ban on colistin use in livestock offers a unique opportunity to assess the impact of this intervention on colistin resistance in humans and animals, and how a One Health perspective can strengthen this intervention. This project aims to: i) determine phenotypic and genotypic colistin resistance in E. coli from humans and poultry in Indonesia; ii) assess the impact of the colistin ban on resistance in E. coli in animals and humans; iii) estimate the transmission of colistin resistance between animals and humans; iv) study colistin use and perceptions at the community level; and v) expand the initial colistin ban in the animal production sector into an integrative multi-sectorial One Health intervention, which will be designed and implemented using a community participatory approach. This project will provide a strong scientific basis to AMR policies in Indonesia, with great significance across Southeast Asia.
The Effect of Reflective Breathing Therapy Compared With Conventional Breathing Therapy in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) III-IV; part2 The purpose of this study is to determine whether different types of breathing therapies in patients with COPD III-IV decrease dyspnea, increase activity and have impact on parasympathetic activities.
Randomized Evaluation of Patients With Stable Angina Comparing Diagnostic Examinations This randomized, controlled, diagnostic, multicenter trial will compare two diagnostic imaging pathways--coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)--to determine the incidence of major adverse coronary events (MACE), defined as myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac-related death, and cross-over to revascularization. CCTA may be used to direct patients with symptoms of stable angina or angina equivalent to optimal medical therapy (OMT). The use of CCTA as a diagnostic tool for angina symptoms will be associated with no increase in MACE or revascularization, decreased cost, reduced risks (e.g., less radiation exposure), additional insights into alternate explanations of chest pain, and increased cost-effectiveness in comparison with use of SPECT MPI/invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
Evaluation of Safety and Health Involvement For Truck Drivers The current project is a randomized, controlled evaluation of a new weight loss and health promotion intervention for truck drivers. The intervention is a 6-month weight loss competition supported with computer based training, behavioral self-monitoring, and motivational interviewing. We hypothesize that the intervention will produce greater change than a usual practices control condition. Our secondary hypothesis is that social support and stress in home and work environments will moderate intervention efficacy.

Model for PK/PD of Antimicrobials in Blood Stream Infection: Feasibility The current study is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a superordinate project. The final objective of this superordinate project is to describe and model the pharmacokinetic behaviour of a small number of standard antimicrobials used in the treatment of frequent blood stream infections, and to link this via pharmacodynamic models to (inhibition of) bacterial or fungal growth as well as to clinical outcomes in patients.
DEXTENZA VS. PREDNISOLONE ACETATE 1% Macular Edema With Diabetic Retinopathy After Cataract Surgery The complicated schedules for administering topical steroid eye drops combined with forgetfulness and physical difficulties instilling the drops may compromise compliance; which in turn could increase the risk for secondary complications such as PME post-cataract surgery, especially in a high-risk diabetic population. Dextenza, a sustained- release steroid insert, could help preclude adherence difficulties and provide better bioavailability, being as effective as, or more effective than steroid drops in preventing PME. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of PME in diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery when comparing the Dextenza insert to topical prednisolone acetate 1% drops.

Impact of Advance Care Planning on Care for Patients With Advanced Heart Failure Aims: Advance care planning (ACP) is considered to be one of the most promising interventions to enable patients with life limiting illnesses to receive treatment at the end of life (EOL) according to their own preferences and to promote EOL conversations between patients and their health care providers. Through a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with Class III and IV heart failure (New York Heart Association Functional Classification), we propose to assess:  1. Whether patients in the ACP arm have a greater likelihood of receiving EOL care consistent with their preferences as stated in the latter of the last ACP document or the last patient interview, compared to patients in the control arm. 2. Heath care costs during study duration between patients in ACP and control arms. 3. Patient's understanding of own illness and their participation in decision making between the ACP and control arms. 4. Patient's quality of life, anxiety and depression between ACP and control arms.  Methodology: A total of 254 patients with advance heart failure will be randomized to receive intervention (ACP arm; N=127) or usual care (control arm; N=127).  The RCT will be conducted at the National Heart Centre and Singapore General Hospital. Patients in both arms will be followed for one year or till death, whichever is earlier, and interviewed every 4 months during this duration.  Clinical Significance: If benefits of ACP are shown to add value through this trial, then this study will help to promote acceptance of ACP among patients and health care providers across Singapore and elsewhere.
Role of Esophageal Mast Cell Activation in Noncardiac Chest Pain (NCCP) Chest pain is a common clinical complaint. About 30% patients with chest pain will have a normal coronary angiogram and are described as having noncardiac chest pain (NCCP). It is estimated that 25% of the population complain of chest pain at some time in their lifetime. The pathogenesis of NCCP is unknown. Esophageal hypersensitivity as a result of inflammation is considered to be an important mechanism in the development of this pain sensation. Little is currently known about the interaction between inflammatory mediators and peripheral afferent nerve terminals in the esophagus. The mast cell is one of the most enriched pro-inflammatory cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Activation of the mucosal mast cell releases a variety of mediators into adjacent tissues. We hypothesize that mediators released by mast cells sensitize esophageal nociceptors and induce pain sensation.
Biomarker Signature of Stroke Aetiology Study: The BIOSIGNAL-Study The three-year cumulative risk of a recurrent stroke, dependent on aetiology, is up to 25 per cent. At present, preventing recurrence relies on a broad approach to reduce risk factors associated with atherosclerosis, heart disease and metabolic disorders. However, more specific interventions, such as anticoagulation and surgery or stenting, need aetiologic information. BIOSIGNAL aims to determine where the most promising candidate biomarkers can help identify stroke aetiology and also predict overall MACE, including specifically recurrent stroke. In addition, the insights gained into the processes underlying different stroke subtypes may lead to more targeted diagnostic tools.
Reduced Knee Flexion Strength 18 Years After ACL Reconstruction in Hamstring Group Compared to Patellar Tendon Group Background: Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and a double-looped semitendinosus gracilis (hamstring group) graft are commonly used for ACL reconstruction. Short-term and mid-term studies show little to no significant difference between the two groups, and there are a few long term studies to compare results between the two grafts.  Purpose: To compare the results after using either BPTB grafts or hamstring grafts 18 years after ACL reconstruction.  Study design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence II. Methods: 114 patients with ACL rupture between 2001 and 2004 were randomized to reconstruction with either BPTB graft or a hamstring graft. Patients were operated at four major hospitals. The 18-year follow-up evaluation included isokinetic testing of muscle strength, patient-reported outcome measures, clinical knee examination and an assessment of radiological osteoarthritis using the Kellgren-Lawrence classification.  Hypothesis:Hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the long-term outcome between the two groups, as well hypothesis of no difference in patients with prosthesis after ACL reconstruction, arthrosis difference in operated knees and the rate of graft failure between the two groups. Previous follow-up studies showed a significant difference in total flexion work between the two groups, so detecting a persistent difference between the groups will be point of interest.
Hypoglycemia Prediction Model Our goal for this Learning Healthcare System Demonstration Project is to reduce the rate of inpatient hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can result in longer lengths of stay and increased morbidity and mortality (ie falls and cardiovascular or cerebral events).  The group at Washington University (WSL) developed a predictive hypoglycemia risk score. Using current glucose, body weight, creatinine clearance, insulin type and dosing, and oral diabetic therapy, they identified patients at high risk for hypoglycemia and then provided in-person education to the providers of these patients. This resulted in a 68% reduction in severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose \< 40 mg/dL). This approach required significant personnel hours and is difficult to replicate in other systems.  The investigators will implement an EHR-based intervention at UCSF to predict which patients are at high risk of inpatient hypoglycemia and take action to prevent the hypoglycemic event. In real time, all adult (non OB) patients with a glucose \< 90, and a high risk of future hypoglycemia (based on the WSL formula) will be identified. Patients will be randomly assigned to intervention or no intervention (current standard care). The intervention will consist of an automated provider alert with recommendations on what adjustments could be made to avoid a potentially serious hypoglycemic event.  The outcomes that will be measured include: 1) reductions in serious hypoglycemic events, 2) monitor the changes made by providers as a result of alerts in order to study provider behavior and identify future areas of intervention, and 3) provider satisfaction with the alert system.
Body Impedance Analysis to Detect ICUAW The aim of the study is to detect a value of muscle and organ mass measured by body impedance analysis and its correlation with the Medical Research Council (MRC) score. An MRC score ≤ 48 is defined as a diagnosis of ICU acquired weakness. The correlation of the values detected by BIA and their transfer to an MRC Score ≤ 48 will be investigated.  The knowledge gained will be used for early detection of ICUAW in order to reduce the consequences of the same.

The safety of BKM120 will also be studied.
Evaluating Two Multifocal Daily Disposable Contact Lenses The objective of the study is to adapt existing multifocal soft lens wearers to a CONTROL lens for at least 2 weeks and then evaluate the success of switching them to the TEST lens, with a review after 2 weeks.
Risk Stratification to Promote Effective Shared Decision-Making for Colorectal Cancer Screening Shared decision-making (SDM) has been advocated as a strategy for increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates. Our studies to date suggest that while the use of a novel computer-based decision aid facilitates several components of SDM from both the patient and provider perspective, there is a reluctance among providers to acquiesce to patient preferences for a particular screening strategy when its differs from their own. The overall objective of this study is to assess whether risk stratification for advanced colorectal neoplasia influences clinical decision-making related to screening test selection and adherence within a SDM framework. Eligible subjects will be randomized to either an experimental arm, in which they will be asked to complete a 6-item risk assessment questionnaire known as the "Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia Index \[ACNI\]" after reviewing a web-based decision aid, or a control arm, in which they will only review the decision aid. Both interventions will take place just before a prearranged office visit with their provider. The primary outcome will be screening test ordered; secondary outcomes will include test completion rates, concordance between test preference and test ordered,, patient satisfaction with decision-making process, screening intentions, 6-month test completion rates and provider satisfaction. Outcomes will be evaluated using computerized tracking systems or validated instruments.

Reducing the Abuse of Opioids in Drug Users The consequences of prescription opioid abuse are serious and the number of deaths from unintended overdose have quadrupled over the last 15+ years. Opioid analgesics remain among the most commonly abused class of substances in the United States. Moreover, patients who take pain medications for legitimate reasons may develop an opioid use disorder (OUD), with as many as 1 in 4 patients becoming dependent on their pain medications. Because of changing access to prescription opioid analgesics due to an increasingly negative prescribing climate and changes in guidelines, patients often turn to heroin, with an estimated 1 in 15 pain patients trying heroin within 10 years. Pain is a symptom that can be severely debilitating and needs to be treated adequately to improve the quality of life. Clinicians, then, are in a proverbial "catch-22" situation whereby treating a patient's chronic pain also exposes them to medications with substantial abuse liability and overdose risk. In this proposal, a method aimed at reducing the abuse potential of prescription opioid medications, without altering their analgesic efficacy, is described.  The study team hypothesize that this can be accomplished by administering a fixed-dose-combination of an opioid with an atypical antipsychotic drug, in the same pill or capsule.

Brain fMRT In Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Certain cardiac and neurologic diseases influence each other via a still poorly understood "brain-heart axis". Subarachnoidal bleedings are well known to cause ECG alterations resembling those of myocardial infarction, along with a reduction of systolic myocardial function ("neurogenic stunned myocardium"). Alterations of the right insula region by a stroke or intracranial hemorrhage go along with a sympathetic activation (increased circulating catecholamine levels, tachycardia, arterial hypertension). In contrast, alterations of the left insula region often cause vagal reactions such as bradycardia, arterial hypotension. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a just recently recognised subform of heart attacks, often caused by psychological or physical stress (death of a beloved one, divorce, job loss, infection, preoperative state). In more than 90% of cases, TTC affects postmenopausal women.  Functional MRT enables imaging of activated brain regions, either without ("resting state") or with specific stimuli. The investigators speculate that there is a specific involvement of the insula region during TTC.
Study of PCUR-101 in Combination With ADT in Patients With mCRPC This is an open label, non-randomized, Phase I, dose escalation/dose expansion study in cohorts of patients with metastatic CRPC at Screening. Dose escalation uses a 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD is defined, the dose expansion phase is used to define the recommended phase 2 dose.
Safety and Efficacy of T89 in Prevention and Treatment of Adults With Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is one of three syndromes of altitude illness. It is very common when people venture over 2500 meters altitude. This illness is mainly induced by acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude that will cause a pathological effect on humans. T89 capsule is a modernized industrialized traditional Chinese herbal medicine. It is a botanical drug for oral use. In recent years, several literatures and clinical studies have showed that oral administration of T89 may provide substantial benefits in the prevention or alleviation of symptoms associated with acute mountain sickness (AMS), including nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Such effect was also observed in a pilot clinical study recently conducted in Tibet in China.  This study is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial having three arms including T89 low-dose, T89 high-dose and a placebo controlled group. People will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria after informed consent signed. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned into one of three arms and instructed to use T89 orally twice daily for 14 days (Days 1-14) before ascending, and 5 days after ascending during the observation period (Days 15-19). The primary efficacy parameter is Lake Louise Scoring System (LLSS) which will be evaluated by subject-self and principal investigator in clinic.

Clinical Performance of a One-step Self-etch Adhesive in Non-carious Cervical Lesions at 2 Years Objectives: One-step self-etch adhesives are the latest adhesives introduced into the market. The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that a one-step self-etch adhesive performs equally well as a two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive.  Materials and methods: Thirty two patients with 96 non-carious cervical lesions received composite-resin restorations (Tetric Evo Ceram - Ivoclar/Vivadent), which were bonded either with a one-step self-etch adhesive (AdheSE One - Ivoclar/Vivadent) with or without enamel etching, or with a two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive (ExiTE - Ivoclar/Vivadent). All restorations were evaluated by two examiners at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months regarding retention, caries recurrence, marginal integrity and discoloration. Retention loss, severe marginal defects and/or discoloration that needed intervention (repair or replacement) and occurrence of caries, were considered as clinical failures. A logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations was used to account for the clustered data (three restorations per patient).
Distal Perfusion Timing, Early or Conservative, to Prevent Limb Ischemia During Peripheral VA-ECMO Peripheral VA-ECMO is widely used in refractory cardiogenic shock patients as a salvage therapy. In most cases, the femoral artery and vein are used for the vascular approach. Large cannulas are usually used for proper oxygenation, which may cause peripheral limb ischemia. Distal perfusion catheterization (DPC) at the ipsilateral arterial cannula site is recommended to prevent distal limb ischemia. However, there is no consensus on the proper timing of DPC and additional invasive procedures may cause complications during VA-ECMO support. In this analysis, the investigators compare the clinical outcomes of distal limb ischemia complications between the conventional DPC group (DPC at the time of limb ischemia sign) and the preemptive DPC group (DPC at the time of VA-ECMO application).
Fat Metabolism in OSA and COPD Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common type of sleep apnea and is caused by an obstruction of the upper airways. The obstruction results in periods of intermittent hypoxia and re-oxygenation, which lead to increased oxidative stress, increased inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that leads to poor airflow. This disease leads to systemic hypoxia, reduced oxidative capacity, and increased inflammation. The direct cause of OSA and COPD is unclear, but OSA and COPD may be linked to other comorbid conditions such as obesity and type II diabetes. Upon onset of OSA and COPD, metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and type II diabetes can be exacerbated.  Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in visceral fat, elevated plasma levels of free fatty acids, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Although the effects of body fat distribution have not been studied in these patients, an increase in both subcutaneous and abdominal fat mass in non-OSA older women was shown to increase morbidity and mortality. Fat/adipose tissue is an active tissue capable of secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, reactive oxygen species and adipokines. Particularly, abdominal fat is a prominent source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contributes to a low grade, chronic inflammatory state in these patients. Additionally, an increased inflammatory state is associated with reduced lean body mass, and together with elevated circulating free fatty acids may increase the occurrence of lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Thus, increased fat deposition is associated with a poor prognosis in OSA and COPD patients and therefore it is of clinical and scientific importance to understand the changes in fat metabolism and digestion as a result of OSA and COPD.  It is therefore our hypothesis that fat synthesis and insulin resistance is increased and whole body protein synthesis is decreased in OSA and COPD patients, leading to a poor prognosis.
Implementing Oral Care Bundle on Critical Care Nurses' Practice and Mechanically Ventilated Patients' Outcomes Oral care is a fundamental aspect of nursing that impact the health and comfort of patients over both the short and long term. Caring for very sick patients in a busy stressful environment may result in oral care having a lower priority for nurses than other aspects of care (Sarangi, Simon, \& Sarangi, 2021). Negligence of these interventions can cause long-term oral problems and nosocomial diseases most notably VAP (Abd Alraheem, 2020).  A study conducted by Ayşe et al. (2019) reported that the application of regular oral care for the MV patients as a part of care protocols decreased bacterial colonization and had a protective and improving effect on oral health. A recent study conducted by Rizk, Saad-eldeen and Helmy (2020) concluded that VAP is a serious ICU acquired infection with significant impact and required effective preventive action. A systematic review conducted by Kharel, Bist and Mishra (2021) concluded that VAP is a critical issue in ICU with a high-cost burden and various interventional educational programs like staff training and hygiene awareness can reduce the future risk of VAP.  A recent study conducted by Abd Alraheem (2020) illustrated that 53.3% of the MV patients had average oral alteration. Asystematic review conducted by Kharel et al. (2021) to assess VAP among ICU patients in WHO South east Asian region illustrated that the VAP incidence rate ranged from 0.2% to 11.6% differing greatly between countries. The highest VAP prevalence rate was reported from the medical ICU, India, where as the lowest was from the palliative care ICU, South Korea.  In Egypt, analysis of VAP was done in some Egyptian University Hospitals by Fathy, Abdelhafeez, EL-Gilany and Abd Elhafez, (2013) who reported that the incidence of VAP ranged from 16% to 75%, the lowest ratio was in Alexandria University 16% and the highest one in Ain Shams University 75%. The incidence in Mansoura University Hospitals (MUH) was 22.6%. Another recent study conducted by Elkolaly, Bahr, El-Shafey, Basuoni, and Elber (2019) reported that the incidence of VAP in Tanta University Hospitals is still high (38.4%).  Many studies investigated the effect of oral care with chlorhexidine on the incidence of VAP and oral health in MV patients (Abd Alraheem, 2020; Collins et al., 2020; Heck, 2012; Moustafa, Tantawey, El-Soussi and Ramadan, 2016; Plantinga et al., 2016). However, the recent reappraisal of the evidence suggests that chlorhexidine does not reduce VAP, causes excess mortality in non-cardiac surgery patients (Dale et al., 2019) and unexpected high incidence of oral mucosal lesions (Plantinga et al., 2016).  Moreover, from my empirical experience, chlorhexidine is not available in all Egyptian hospitals because of its economic burden. A study conducted by Moustafa et al. (2016) recommended regular updates about evidence-based guidelines for oral care and its effect on VAP prevention and oral health. The debate of the literature about oral care inspired us to investigate this area.

Natural History, Genetic Bases and Phenotype-genotype Correlations in Autosomal Dominant Spinocerebellar Degenerations The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar degenerations are a highly heterogeneous, clinically and genetically, group of rare diseases and of severe evolution. So far, the responsible genes for less than 50% of the cases are known and because of their rarity, there are no phenotype-genotype correlations and well-defined disease history.  The aims of the project are to develop and validate quantitative tools of the cerebellar syndrome and of the spasticity, to establish links between the phenotype and the result of the molecular analysis, to identify new loci/genes responsible for these disorders, and to establish the natural history of the disease according to the genotype.  To this end, a prospective and multicentric study is proposed for recruiting and evaluating, clinically, a cohort of 225 patients; 150 of them are already followed-up in the centers involved. A DNA collection will be set up in order to search for the implication of new loci and genes. A clinico-genetic database will be set up combining data from successive clinical evaluations and those of genotyping.  This strategy will allow access to genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis (positive, presymptomatic or prenatal diagnoses), based on a rational strategy from phenotype-genotype correlations and the information concerning the relative frequency of the genes. The detailed description, with the help of new evaluation tools and of the follow-up of the natural history of the disease according to the genotype, constitutes a crucial step in the design of therapeutical trials in these orphan disorders. Furthermore, the regular follow-up by specialized centers will allow better care of the patients.

MELA Study - Hedonic Study on the Taste of Drugs Crushed in Food: Observational Study Involving 16 Healthy Volunteers Elderly people often suffer from chronic pathologies and they are given polypharmacy. In case of swallowing problems, the drugs are crushed and mixed in food, which alters the taste of food and is a cause of anorexia and malnutrition. Gustative side-effects of crushed drugs have nether been investigated. The MELA study is a one session hedonic test involving 16 healthy volunteers. They will score in a blind manner the taste of 10 drugs commonly prescribed in nursing homes, crushed in jelly or apple compote. These volunteers will be 8 food professionals and 8 geriatric care professionals. Thanks to the MELA protocol, they will have a unique opportunity to communicate and propose solutions to this neglected aspect of malnutrition in elderly populations.
Evaluation of the Patient's Experience in Medical Studies for Cholangiocarcinoma The main reason for conducting this research is to gain a better understanding of why some people with cholangiocarcinoma are not able to participate in or complete clinical trials. Historically, certain groups of people have been more likely to participate in clinical trials, but there hasn't been much research to understand why this is the case.  The goal is to find out which aspects of a clinical trial may make it more difficult for patients to take part or see it through. The data will be evaluated through different demographic lenses and identify trends that could help improve the experience of future cholangiocarcinoma patients during clinical trials.

Impact of Renal SympAthetic DenerVation on Chronic HypErtension Despite the development of many drug therapies designed to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), it remains a considerable and poorly managed health, social and economic burden. For various reasons, including the high health care costs of treatment, there are estimates that up to 65% of patients with high blood pressure have untreated and/or uncontrolled blood pressure (BP).  Aside from its effect on kidney function, chronic high blood pressure increases the risk for stroke, and heart disease. It is also thought to be involved in the formation of irregular heartbeats. This link between high blood pressure and heart health has been well described, as has their combined effect on the aging and the obesity-battling Western world.  A recently published study (Symplicity HTN-2 trial) established the benefit of a new treatment procedure, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation (RSDN) for hypertension, as having enormous potential for the treatment of patients with high blood pressure. This multi-center trial will attempt to confirm and expand on these promising data. Patients who enroll in the trial will be followed for 4 years.

Extended Dose Intervals With Oral Cholera Vaccine in Cameroon The primary aim of this project is to determine changes in the vibriocidal geometric mean titers (GMT) in subjects who receive the second dose of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) at different intervals: 2 weeks, 6 months, or 11 months following the first dose of vaccine. Secondary aims include a) vibriocidal antibody response rates in subjects who receive OCV at 2 weeks, 6 months, or 11 months following the first dose of vaccine, b) age specific serum vibriocidal GMTs following the second dose among participants given the second dose of OCV at intervals of 2 weeks, 6 months, or 11 months following the first dose of vaccine, c) GMT and antibody response rates of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as measured by ELISA following the second dose among participants given the second dose of OCV at intervals of 2 weeks, 6 months, or 11 months following the first dose of vaccine. The hypothesis is that the vibriocidal GMT following the second dose, when given after 6 or 12 months will not be inferior to the response when the second dose is given according to the standard interval of two weeks.

A 90 Day Observational Study as an Extension to the Phase 3,Open Labeled Exploratory Study of RELiZORB Children with inadequate intestinal absorption due to loss of large amounts of small bowel require intravenous nutrition (feeding through the vein) to sustain hydration and nutrition to avoid starvation and dehydration; however, intravenous (IV) nutrition can lead to complications including liver failure. Tube feeding directly to the small intestine avoids the complications of IV nutrition, but fats are not fully digestible due to inadequate bowel function. We propose to predigest the fat using a small cartridge attached to the feeding tube to allow for rapid absorption with the possibility of reducing or eliminating the need for intravenous nutrition. Goal of the observational study is to determine safety and tolerability of Relizorb Enzyme Cartridge for an additional 90 days after the original trial
Dose Frequency RCT on DTTC in Children With CAS Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a pediatric motor-based speech sound disorder that requires a specialized approach to intervention (Maas et al., 2014). The extant literature on the treatment of CAS commonly recommends intensive treatment using a motor-based approach, with some of the best evidence supporting the use of Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC; Strand, 2020). To date, a rigorous and systematic comparison of high and low dose frequency has not been undertaken for DTTC, resulting in a lack of evidence to guide decisions about the optimal treatment schedule for this intervention. The current study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by comparing treatment outcomes when dose frequency is varied.  The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether the number of treatment sessions per week has an effect on intervention outcomes in 60 children with CAS. The main question this research will address is whether whole word accuracy will differ between two groups of children undergoing DTTC treatment when one group of children receives treatment twice a week for 12 weeks and the other group receives treatment 4 times a week for 6 weeks. Community clinicians will administer all treatment sessions.

Long Term Study of Avonex Therapy Following a First Attack of Multiple Sclerosis The current study is a continuation of the 5 year extension study of the phase III CHAMPS study (see reference). This study was designed to determine if immediate initiation of therapy with Interferon Beta-1a (AVONEX) after a first attack of multiple sclerosis (MS) continues to delay the development of further attacks (CDMS) and the development of neurological disability over a 10 year period of observation. The initial 5 year extension study, called CHAMPIONS5, reported that immediate initiation of interferon Beta-1a (AVONEX) after a first attack of MS continued to delay the development of CDMS and lowered relapse rates compared to delayed initiation of disease modifying treatment (usually with AVONEX) either at the time of a second attack or at the end of the phase III study (24 months). The study was extended to 10 years to determine if these effects are sustained and result in less long term permanent disability.
A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Treatment of Mallet Fractures Intra-articular fractures at the dorsal base of the distal phalanx of the hand are usually referred to as Mallet fractures. Treatment of Mallet fractures remains controversial. Although no differences in clinical results are reported between conservative treatment and operative treatment, operative treatment is suggested for fractures involving more than 30% of articular surface. There are many different operative techniques, all with specific disadvantages. The investigators hypothesis is that operative treatment of Mallet fractures with one Meniscus Arrow® has a better outcome than conservative treatment with a Mallet splint.

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Walking in Multiple Sclerosis Weakness on one side of the body is a hallmark of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which has been determined to be a significant cause of progressive worsening of walking abilities. Currently, there are no efficient rehabilitation strategies available to target strength asymmetries and walking impairments. Many of the current treatments, including pharmaceuticals, are only mildly effective and are often very expensive. Thus, the development of practical, inexpensive, and effective adjunct treatments is needed.  The study is to examine the efficacy of different tDCS protocols at improving walking in PwMS. Although the details of the studies slightly vary, the global aspects of the experimental procedures are identical with the exception that the tDCS stimulation parameter timing differs between the groups. The study will be double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized cross-over design.  Maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the right and left knee extensors, knee flexors, hip flexors, and dorsiflexors will be performed to determine the more-affected leg.  The study compromises 2 groups of subjects which will attend the lab for three sessions. In the first session subjects will be consented, complete the PDDS, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and a 6 minute walk test (6-MWT) for baseline performance. The second session will involve a 6 MWT performed in association with 2 conditions. Group 1: DURINGtDCS, DURINGSHAM. Group 2: BEFOREtDCS, BEFORESHAM. The conditions in each group will be in a randomized order. Intensity of tDCS will be 2mA for both groups. Group 1 will receive the conditions during the 6 MWT. tDCS for 6 min has been shown to be sufficient to induce cortical excitability. Group 2 will receive 13 min of tDCS or sham, which results in after effects lasting through the completion of the 6 MWT. tDCS will be applied to the motor cortex (M1) corresponding to the more-affected leg either before or during the 6 min walk test

Evaluation of Early Use of Everolimus (EVE) on Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection in Renal Transplant Recipients CMV infection is common in transplant patients and can cause graft loss. CMV is a major factor in increasing morbidity, and post-transplant costs. The CMV infection is associated with many deleterious indirect effects including rejection, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, mortality. In addition to the potential for undesirable clinical outcomes associated with CMV, there is also a negative economic aspect. Patients who developed CMV events have been found to use significantly more inpatient and outpatient resources than patients without CMV disease. Universal prophylaxis is associated with high treatment cost and the potential for drug-related toxicity. It can be speculated that use of EVR may offer additional economic benefits in terms of decreased utilization associated with prevention of CMV disease, and reduce use of costly prophylaxis. Any efforts to reduce costs in renal transplants are very important and may have a great impact in total cost of a renal program. And the other hand, the clinical data suggest that EVR is associated with a decrease in CMV incidence compared to mycophenolic acid (MPA). CMV replication is dependent upon 1 ou 2 mTor pathways and in vitro studies support an association between mTor inhibitors and decreased CMV infection and disease. In cardiac transplantation, the use of EVR was associated with a lower incidence of CMV events. Some clinical trials data have also shown that use of EVR was associated with a lower incidence of CMV infection compared to MPA following renal transplantation. Brennan et al compared the incidence of CMV in three clinical trials using EVR versus MPA in De Novo renal transplants. They pooled for analysis the studies B201, B251 and A2309, all double-blind, randomized, parallel-groups that compared the incidence of freedom form and incidence of CMV between EVR groups and MPA groups. The results of this pooled analysis of over 2000 patients de novo renal transplant demonstrated that EVR was associated with a decrease in and delay in the time of onset of CMV events compared to MPA. Our hypothesis is that basiliximab in combination with low dose tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone may result in comparable efficacy (BCAR) observed in patients receiving tacrolimus/mycophenolate/prednisone but with a better safety profile (CMV infection) and cost-effectiveness.
Geriatric Assessments in Elderly Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Patients-2 (GERIAD2) This study will validate the impact of comprehensive geriatric assessments using activity of daily living (ADL), instrumental activity of daily living (IADL), and Charlson's comorbidity index (CCI) on survival and toxicities in Korean patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP.

Nutritional Intervention-induced Weight Loss During the Oncological Treatment of Obesity-related Breast Cancer Obesity could become the first evitable cause of breast cancer in the near future. Due to the relatively slow rate of development in this field, greater efforts must be applied in this area. The HYPOTHESIS of this work is that "a therapy to lose weight in breast cancer women with obesity during the oncological treatment could contribute to slowing carcinogenesis, and to improve the response to the chemotherapy, survival and prevent future recurrences by erasing deleterious epigenetic marks". A group of breast cancer women with obesity (n=90) will be treated to lose weight during the oncologic treatment with a low calorie-ketogenic diet or a group educational intervention program of healthy lifestyle. The reversibility of the obesity-related breast cancer epigenetic signatures (EPIC array and pyrosequencing) and other molecular features (QRTPCR, ELISA assays) in blood leukocytes and plasma and the progression of disease will be compared with an obesity (n=30) and normalweight (n=30) group under conventional anticancer therapy. A matched-group of tumor-free women (n=60) with obesity will be also treated to lose weight with the same nutritional interventions and compared with tumor-free women with normal weight (n=30) in order to evaluate the potential preventive function of weight loss therapies on cancer-related odds. The outcomes of this project will directly benefit overweight and obese patients from healthcare systems, and also to have an economic value supporting pharmaceutical and food industry companies in the design of innovative treatments, useful biomarkers and preventive tools.

Potential of Transplanted Stem Cells to Mature Into Salivary Gland and Cheek Cells This study will examine whether transplanted stem cells can turn into salivary gland cells in stem cell recipients. If so, stem cells might be used to restore salivary gland function in patients with Sjogren's syndrome and other causes of dry mouth. People with severe dry mouth may develop difficulty swallowing, severe tooth decay, infections of the mouth and pharynx, and mouth sores.  Female patients 18 years of age and older who are enrolled in the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's protocol 97-H-009 or 97-H-0202 and who have received a stem cell transplant from a male donor may be eligible for this study. Five patients with graft-versus host disease (GVHD) and five without GVHD will be included. GVHD is a transplantation reaction in which the donor's cells mount an immune response against the recipient's tissues. Patients with chronic GVHD have mouth ulcerations and dry mouth similar to that of patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Five healthy female volunteers will also be enrolled.  Participants will have a medical and dental history. Then, cells will be collected from the inside of the cheek (buccal cell scraping) and from the salivary glands (labial gland biopsy) as described below:  Buccal cell scraping - Cells are collected from the inside of the cheek by wiping for 5 seconds with a plastic brush.  Labial glands biopsy - The lower lip will be numbed and a small incision will be made on the inside of the lower lip. Six small salivary glands in the lower lip will be removed and the incision will be closed with four stitches.  Cells collected from these procedures will be examined to see if donated stem cells turned into salivary gland or cheek cells.  Patients will return to the clinic 5 to 10 days after the biopsy to have the stitches removed and assess healing.

FCR or BR in Patients With Previously Untreated B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and bendamustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide together with rituximab is more effective than giving bendamustine together with rituximab in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab to see how well they work compared with bendamustine and rituximab in treating patients with previously untreated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

An annual follow-up survey will be conducted for 5 years at the longest after standard observational period.
Coronary Flow Reserve Evaluation in PET and in MRI Scanner in Heart Transplanted Patients : Comparison With Multi-detectors Scanner Heart transplantation is the ultimate therapeutic option in patients with end-stage heart failure. Since advances in the treatment of acute rejection has increased early transplant survival, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the main factor limiting long-term survival. The prevalence of angiographically proven CAV is high, documented in 40-50% of transplant recipients 5 years after transplantation. Therefore, annual coronary angiography remains widely used to monitor transplanted patients, although pathologic studies and intravascular ultrasonography have demonstrated that coronary angiography underestimates the severity of CAV. Perfusion SPECT may underestimate allograft vasculopathy in case of diffuse coronary lesions. In this setting, the assessment of coronary reserve by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) have not been investigated.
Evaluation of Pulmonary Perfusion Heterogeneity and Compliance in Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension Using Positron Emission Tomography Imaging The purpose of the study is to find out how the blood flow changes in the lungs of people with pulmonary hypertension compared to healthy individuals without pulmonary hypertension. We would like to find out if there are differences in how blood flows when subjects are given a drug to dilate (widen) the arteries in their lungs and when they breathe extra oxygen. We will compare the results to when subjects don't receive any drug or extra oxygen. We hope that knowing about these differences will help us to better understand pulmonary hypertension and how to diagnose it earlier.
Next Generation Sequencing-Based Stratification of Front Line Treatment of HighGrade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma PRECISION-NEC is a single-center, open-label, pilot feasibility study of molecularly defined subtypes of metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HG-NEC).

Venetoclax in Combination With BEAM Conditioning Regimen for ASCT in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and safety of adding a new cancer drug, Venetoclax, to a standard combination of chemotherapy drugs used prior to Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in participants with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). In this study, Venetoclax will be added to BEAM (BCNU or carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine or ara-c, and melphalan). All NHL participants are admitted for conditioning chemotherapy which is given prior to the infusion of stem cells.  Venetoclax is a new anti-cancer drug that works by targeting a protein (known as the Bcl-2 protein). By inhibiting or "blocking" this protein, a downstream cascade occurs which results in cancer cells to die. Adding Venetoclax to the standard BEAM conditioning chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is believed to increase the chance of remission. Venetoclax is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, Venetoclax is investigational for this study because it is not yet approved for use in participants with NHL or in combination with BEAM chemotherapy.

Phase 1/2 Clinical Study of TPX-115 in Patients With Partial-Thickness Rotator Cuff Tear Rotator cuff tear is one of the most common shoulder diseases and conservative treatment is commonly used for tears involving ≤50% of tendon thickness. Since conventional conservative treatments are not fundamental to repair tendon tissue, there is a growing need of new therapy to improve structural outcome. This study assesses the safety and efficacy of allogeneic fibroblasts on partial-thickness rotator cuff tear. The primary outcome is change in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score at 24 weeks after TPX-115 injection. Secondary outcomes include changes from baseline in Visual Analogue Score (VAS) pain score, functional evaluations including Range of Motion (ROM), Constant Score (CS), ASES score and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after administration and structural evaluation using MRI at 24 weeks after injection.

The safety and tolerability of these drugs will be studied.  Each participant will complete 2 study periods in fixed order. After screening, Period 1 will last approximately 8 days and Period 2 will last approximately 15 days. Participants who complete Period 2 may continue to receive Abemaciclib in 28-day cycles until discontinuation criteria are met.
Effectiveness of NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) at Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technology that continuously monitors regional tissue oxygenation (tissue saturation with oxygen). NIRS is used to evaluate the oxygen saturation of the brain and other tissues (such as muscle, liver, lung). NIRS is a non-invasive, simple, bedside method that can be used safely in stroke patients, as it is a method that can be performed at the bedside and does not affect the treatment process. The NIRS, which we will use in our study, continuously measures with the help of two electrodes affixed to the forehead area, right and left.  There are previously created scales and scales based on neurological examination in the follow-up of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The main ones are the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which is used without evaluating the patient's consciousness; It is the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which is used to evaluate the severity of ischemic stroke, its suitability for treatment and treatment response, and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), which is used to evaluate the daily activity ability of individuals. However, since these cannot predict the patient's response to treatment and complications that will develop early, and there are no objective parameters, there is a need for methods that require objective monitoring of the patients.  Acute ischemic stroke patients who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy with NIRS and / or who underwent endovascular thrombectomy are monitored for 24 hours and the data obtained from this method are compared with the vital findings, GCS, NIHSS, mRS, which are traditionally used in the follow-up of these patients. Thus, it was aimed to evaluate the utility of this method in evaluating the treatment efficacy and prognosis of patients compared to traditional methods in acute ischemic stroke patients.
Is Procardia XL 60 mg Q Daily Equivalent to 30 mg XL Given Twice Daily? Antihypertensive therapy has been used in pregnant patients antepartum to improve blood pressure (BP) elevation in cases of chronic hypertension, and postpartum for persistent hypertension after delivery in cases of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as for management of chronic hypertension.  There is limited evidence regarding the precise BP level at which antihypertensive therapy is indicated during pregnancy for chronic hypertension. Treatment has been suggested in pregnant patients when systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and at a lower diastolic BP threshold of 105 mm Hg, however some providers may initiate therapy at systolic BPs ≥ 150 mmHg.  Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator and an ideal first line antihypertensive agent due to its low maternal side-effect profile. It has been proven to be safe in pregnancy. Conventional nifedipine can be started at 10 mg twice daily with a maximum dose of 120 mg/d, but frequently extended release tablets are preferred due to steady blood pressure control with once daily administration.  It is frequently used however as a twice daily dosing as many providers have noticed an increase in the BPs 12-24h from administration. Twice daily dosing might produce overlapping profiles that prevent elevation of BP at the time of the next administration and breakthrough elevations throughout the day in pregnant women.  The aim of this study is to investigate the mean plasma levels and standard deviations of Procardia at 24h after Procardia XL is administered as a 60 mg daily dose and the mean plasma levels after it is given as a 30 mg twice-daily dose. This will be a pilot study for a future randomized control trial that will allow the researchers to determine whether 60 mg daily of Procardia XL is equivalent to 30 mg twice daily. Secondary outcome will be effective control of BP throughout the day (0h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h and 24h) defined as BPs below 160/105 as well as side effects of nifedipine as reported by patients.
A Pilot Study of Ultra-High-Dose Hypofractionated or Single-Dose Radiotherapy for Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer The present study evaluates clinical outcomes and treatment-related toxicity following definitive ultra-high dose external beam radiotherapy delivered with two different regimens in patients with intermediate-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Modern computer-driven technology enables the implementation of ultra-high hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) safely.  Prostate cancer patients classified according to the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as intermediate risk (biopsy Gleason score of 7 and/or Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level \>10 and ≤20 ng/mL and/or Stage T1, T2a, T2b or T2c) are eligible for this study.  Patients will undergo IGRT with volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) with state-of-the-art treatment-planning and quality assurance procedures. Emphasis is placed on normal tissue sparing and delivery accuracy via the use of devices that ensure stability and beam location reproducibility. A rectal balloon with air filling will be used for prostate target immobilization and anatomical reproducibility, while a urethral catheter loaded with beacon transponders will be used to ensure set-up reproducibility and online target tracking. Previously untreated patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer will be prospectively randomized to receive either 45 Gy in five fractions of 9 Gy each vs. 24 Gy in a single-dose.  Patients will be followed at one month post-treatment and every 3 months for up to 12 months (+/- 4 weeks) and every 6 months thereafter. Acute and chronic toxicity evaluations will focus on urinary, rectal and sexual functions and will be assessed through validated questionnaires. Serum PSA values will be regularly acquired during follow-up. A multiparametric MRI will be performed at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months following intervention. Additionally, a post-treatment diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) will be performed within 15 minutes of the first treatment, to measure early physiologic changes, such as perfusion and ischemia, that may correlate with clinically relevant end-points. Post-treatment prostate needle biopsies will be obtained at 24 months to evaluate pathologic response to therapy. The study will be continuously monitored for a minimum of 5 years. In the event unexpected severe (grade ≥3) toxicities are observed in any one of the treatment arms, the study will be terminated according to the stopping rule \>3/first 15 patients.
Doxorubicin With Cisplatin, High-Dose Methotrexate, and Additional Risk-Adapted Outpatient Chemotherapy The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving certain combinations of chemotherapy drugs before and after surgery, mostly in the outpatient clinic instead of in the hospital, can result in fewer hospital stays during treatment for osteosarcoma.

The hypothesis of the study is that pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) will change independently of left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) when increasing pump speed ie ΔPCWP/RPM ≠ ΔLVEDD/RPM.  The primary combined endpoint of the study is correlation between ΔPCWP and LVEDD slope under ramp testing in a cohort of "continuous-flow left ventricular assist device" heart failure patients.
Development of Cocktail for Measuring the Activity of Important Cytochrome P450 Enzymes The Cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of a wide range of drugs and other xenobiotics. Genetic variants of the encoding P450 genes have shown to influence the rate of metabolism of many clinically used drugs.  The drugs tramadol, omeprazole, losartan, quinidine and caffeine reflect the activity of CYP2D6 (tramadol), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), CYP2C9 (losartan), CYP1A2 (caffeine) and CYP3A4/5 (quinidine).  The aim of the study is to investigate if the cocktail of tramadol, omeprazole, losartan and caffeine can be used to simultaneously determine the activity of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2. Furthermore, will the natural occurring 4-beta-hydroxy-cholesterol in the blood be measured as a metric for CYP3A4/5.  The study is divided in two. First part will include 12 healthy volunteers and consists of three arms separated by at least one week. In the first arm 50 mg of tramadol will be ingested and urine will be collected for 8 hours. In the second arm 20 mg omeprazole, 25 mg losartan and 200 mg caffeine will be ingested followed by 8 hours urine collection and a blood sample 4 hours after administration of the drugs. In the last arm 50 mg of tramadol, 20 mg omeprazole, 25 mg losartan and 200 mg caffeine will be ingested followed by 8 hours urine collection and a blood sample 4 hours after administration of the drugs.  Metabolic ratios will be calculated based on urine and plasma concentrations of the drugs and the relevant metabolites. Relevant genetic variants of the cytochrome P450 encoding genes will be determined.  If the metabolic ratios of the drugs are not significantly different between the arms, Second part of the study will be conducted.  This part is identical with the last arm and will include a maximum of 400 healthy volunteers: 50 mg of tramadol, 20 mg omeprazole, 25 mg losartan and 200 mg caffeine will be ingested followed by 8 hours urine collection and a blood sample 4 hours after administration of the drugs.

Develop and Test the 'Multi-Faced Continuous Exercise Program' in Operable Head and Neck Cancer Patients Background: Due to the disease location and related treatments in head and neck areas following with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT), patients might suffer a series of acute distress and limit their physical activities. Limited physical activities might further cause dysfunction in both the upper body and general physical function.  Purposes: This 3-year project will be conducted for three folds, with the purposes to (1) longitudinally examine the upper body function (mouth open abilities/trismus, neck stiffness/flexibility, shoulder function, myofascial pain, and upper arm muscle strengths) and general physical fitness; and (2) develop a 20-week continuous exercise program and test of its effects on improving upper body function, general physical function, fatigue, and quality of life in operable HNC in the first year of being diagnosed as cancer.  Method: The eligible subjects will be newly diagnosed operable HNC patients. For research purpose (1) (Phase 1), we will conduct the data collection for continuous and follow patients for 12 months (Pre-operation, post-op 1, 3, 6, 12 months,/ T1-T5, respectively) for fatigue, upper body function and general physical fitness, and quality of life. A total of 130 subjects are planned to be recruited based on the sample size calculation. For research purpose (2) (Phase 2), from the second year, the 20-week "Multi-Faced Continuous Exercise Program" will be developed and tested in newly diagnosed operable HNC patients, while compare to those standard care control group of their differences in preventing physical dysfunction and increasing physical function for a 20-week period on post-op 1, 3, \& 6 months (T0-T2, respectively). Data will be analyzed by both descriptive analysis and the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE). There will be 130 subjects in each group (N=260 total) based on power analysis principles.  Expected Outcome: The results will increase our knowledge about the changes in physical activities, physical function, and dysfunction; and the levels of the effectiveness of a continuous exercise program on increasing head and neck cancer patients' physical function and quality of life.
Novel Equation for Estimating Resting Energy Expenditure The energy and nutrition states are closely associated with CKD patients complications and outcomes.To reach the energy balance target, we need the accurate resting energy expenditure level of patients. Traditional equations are not applicable to CKD patients,so we aim to develop and validate a equation for estimating resting energy expenditure in CKD patients.

Evaluation of the Respiratory Function in Renal Transplanted Children Objectives:  While a respiratory abnormality was found in 50% of pediatric renal transplant recipients in a study conducted in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2008, the respiratory status of transplanted children in France remains unknown. The primary objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of respiratory impairment and its characteristics in children with renal transplant. The secondary objective is to study its association with some potential risk factors such as immunosuppressive therapy or humoral immunodeficiency.  Methodology:  This interventional study aims to recruit the 385 children currently being followed by 5 French pediatric renal transplant centers between June 2018 and November 2019. A clinical and functional respiratory assessment will be carried out during the routine annual follow-up of the transplant recipient. Children with clinical signs of concern or abnormal spirometry will be referred to a respiratory specialist. Pharmacokinetic assays of immunosuppressant therapy and the exploration of humoral function will also be performed. The prevalence and type of respiratory abnormalities will be described. Logistic regression will be used to explore the association between potential risk factors and impaired respiratory function.  Expected results:  This study will be the first to evaluate the respiratory status of children with renal transplants in France. The prospective, multi- centered nature of the study, in addition to the large cohort size (which represents two thirds of children with renal transplants in France) will guarantee current, reliable, and representative data for the target population. We will provide new knowledge by precisely characterizing the type of lung injury and looking for potential risk factors. If our study confirms the high prevalence of pulmonary impairment in children with renal transplants, systematic monitoring of respiratory function may be recommended to enable early diagnosis and management. The expected individual and public health benefits would be significant by limiting the appearance of long-term, irreversible sequelae (such as non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis) and improving the quality of life of these patients.
Comparison of Low and Intermediate Dose Low-molecular-weight Heparin to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Pregnancy This is a randomized-controlled open-label trial comparing two different doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in pregnant patients with a history of previous venous thromboembolism (VTE). Both doses are recommended doses in the 2012 guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), but it is not known which dose is more efficacious in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in pregnancy.  Patients enter the study and will be randomized as soon as a home test confirms pregnancy. LMWH will be administered until 6 weeks postpartum. Follow-up will continue until 3 months postpartum. Patients will be recruited by their treating physician, either an obstetrician or internist.

Insulin Detemir in Obesity Management The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the medication insulin detemir on weight, brain function and mood, and on blood vessel and other risk factors for heart disease. The study will compare how diet and insulin detemir affect areas of the brain that are involved in food intake and the sense of pleasure people get from eating.  Participants will be randomized into one of 2 groups. Group 1 will follow a low calorie diet only. Group 2 will follow a low calorie diet and take insulin detemir.  The study is 26 weeks in length and include outpatient visits, inpatient visits, phone and email contact, questionnaires, diary collection, blood draw and procedures involving MRI and PET scans. There are 4 inpatient visits at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC). The inpatient visits require a one night 2 day stay on the CRC at Weeks 2, 6, 16, 26. During the weekly and bi-weekly outpatient visits participants will meet with the study nurse and dietitian.
The Effect of Multiple-Task Training in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis The Activities of Daily Living requires the ability to perform multiple activities at the same time, not just the motor or cognitive activity. When many tasks are performed at the same time, the attention capacity is effectively used and attention is shared according to the difficulty and priority of the tasks. There is evidence that patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have reduced performance during multitasking.  In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of multitasking training on balance, mobility, upper extremity performance and cognitive functions in patients with MS.

DE-CT parameters were then compared between patients who underwent surgery and those who did not.
Rural Engagement in Primary Care for Optimizing Weight Reduction The purpose of this study is to compare three methods for managing obesity in rural patients, to see which method will result in patients being able to attain their weight loss goal and maintain that weight loss.
Evaluation of rGH Therapy to Prevent Muscle Atrophy in Patients With ACL Tears Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are among the most frequent traumatic knee injuries that occur in physically active individuals. Despite advances in minimally invasive surgical reconstruction techniques and aggressive rehabilitation, this atrophy and loss of strength can persist even after patients return to full activity and can place them at considerable risk for re-injury and developing osteoarthritis (OA). The design of new therapeutic interventions to prevent muscle atrophy is needed to advance the care of patients who suffer from ACL injuries. The growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis plays an important role in promoting muscle growth and protecting muscle from atrophy. While GH therapy has shown promise in protecting immobilized muscle from various models of disuse atrophy, it remains unknown whether GH can help to restore strength and protect against the loss in strength that occurs after ACL tear. GH therapy may help to accelerate the safe return to play of patients that suffer ACL tears, and help to prevent the long-term OA and reduction in quality of life that occur after these traumatic knee injuries.
Infants Fed an Amino Acid-based Formula To observe the effects of an amino acid-based formula on symptoms associated with food allergies in infants.
Evaluation of Memory and Forgetting in Patients With Epilepsy Drug-resistant focal epilepsy (DRFE) is frequently associated with complications of varying severity that impair patient's quality of life. Among these complications, cognitive disturbances and especially episodic memory difficulties, play a determinant part. Episodic memory can be defined as a function that allows the mental reconstruction of a past life episode, through complex associative mechanisms that link the vivid experience to its context of occurrence, called encoding context. It is a dynamic cognitive function, which calls on a widely distributed cerebral network, mainly involving the medial temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampus. Epilepsy could have a specific impact on this crucial network, disrupting the binding mechanisms between the experienced events and their encoding context, which are essential for efficient memory. Although patients with DRFE frequently demonstrate memory impairment as assessed by standardised neuropsychological tests, it only imperfectly reflects their difficulties. As a matter of fact, despite a subjective memory complaint, about 20% have no memory impairment on these tests, resulting from a phenomenon called accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF). ALF is indeed characterised by normal performance on standardised neuropsychological tests involving retention delays of 20-30 minutes, but disabling memory complaint and abnormally marked forgetting within hours or days that follow the learning period. This phenomenon is widely described at the conceptual level, but remains difficult to measure in daily practice, at least partly due to methodological limits. Thus, the validated tools available in clinical routine are poorly adapted to the complexity and the associative dimension of memory networks. There is therefore a clinical need for a specific assessment tool that would be able to detect ALF, in order to better quantify it and to enable the appropriate care of patients suffering from DRFE. The aim of the EPIMNESIE study is to evaluate the diagnostic capacity of a behavioural associative memory task, based on the analysis of encoding and consolidation mechanisms, in order to measure ALF. In this prospective study, 40 patients with DRFE and 40 healthy subjects will be proposed to complete a new associative memory task involving a learning phase and two recall sessions which will take place at 30 minutes and 72 hours after the learning phase.
In Vivo IGF-1R Molecular Imaging Using [68Ga]- Labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule The investigators developed \[68Ga\]-labelling Anti-IGF-1R Affibody Molecule as a targeted molecular imaging agent for noninvasive and repeatable detecting IGF-1R expression status.
Chronic Wound Care of Lower Limb in M@diCICAT Center at CHU de Martinique Chronic wound of lower limb. In developed countries, the prevalence of chronic wounds is linked to the ageing of the population and the increase in chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Consequence: amputations of lower limb. The prevalence of chronic wounds is also variable across the globe. In addition, chronic wounds are associated with psychosocial problems such as poor quality of life, loss of professional activity and progressive de-socialization of patients. To improve the quality of care we need in french wound assessment tools validated scientifically like the RESVECH 2.0 scale, validated in the Spanish language.
Stabilized Whole Rice Bran (SWRB) for Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis This clinical trial serves to look at the effectiveness of SWRB for the treatment of mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis in patients below the age of 18. Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common condition seen in dermatology, paediatric and primary care clinics in Malaysia. AD poses a significant biopsychosocial burden among sufferers and their families. Current management patterns of AD sufferers in South-east Asia mainly involve use of topical moisturizers and topical corticosteroids.  Rice bran and products derived from it have been studied regarding their anti-oxidant, nutritional, cholesterol lowering and health promoting properties. However, there are very few studies that have focused on the benefits of SWRB when used topically.  SWRB is cost-effective and easily available, while being an under-utilised product. The investigators wanted to study its effectiveness in controlling the signs and symptoms of Atopic Dermatitis when used as a cleanser and topical paste (emollient) as very little is known on this subject.  The investigators wish to study participants below 18 years of age with mild and moderate Atopic Dermatitis.  The participants will be followed up for four to six (4 - 6) weeks and the clinical features tabulated. This study does not involve any enteral or parenteral administration of SWRB.  Neither does it involve any invasive procedures.

Quincy Family, Youth & Technology For Lifestyle Change (FYT-4-LIFE) Study To date, approaches that show the most promise for preventing and/or reversing the course of childhood obesity involve the delivery of intensive lifestyle interventions within a family-based context, emphasizing the necessity of parental involvement and making changes in family routines and the home environment. Considering that the current demand for pediatric weight management programs far exceed availability, as well as the high attrition rates observed in such programs, there is a great need for more accessible and efficient means of delivering these interventions to reduce the burden of childhood obesity.  The goal of this study is to understand whether text messaging and social media platforms can be leveraged to address the important issue of childhood obesity by engaging parent/guardians in one of these strategies, and whether these strategies produce similar outcomes. No existing study has compared these strategies head-to-head, and the investigators believe that this project will be instrumental in understanding the determinants of success in these strategies and allow us to collect sufficient intelligence to be able to deploy these meaningfully to patients as part of usual care.

A Triple Combination Antiviral Coronavirus Therapy (TriACT) for COVID-19 New outpatient treatments for COVID-19 are urgently needed. There is some evidence that a combination of three medications currently used to treat other viral infections could be effective in fighting this new virus. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Nitazoxanide (NTZ), Ribavirin (RBV) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) versus placebo in participants with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection  The study will enroll 70 participants within the 7 days after having been diagnosed with coronavirus infection. The purpose is to determine if those randomized to 5-day dosing with the three medication combination have decreased viral load and severity of illness in the 10 days following treatment as compared to those taking placebo. Participants will be actively followed for 28 days.
Dry Needling Versus Manual Therapy in Patients With Mechanical Neck Pain: A Randomized Control Trial Background: The current physical therapy evidence for treating patients with the mechanical neck pain recommends both, manual therapy (MT) and dry needling (DN) along with cervical and scapulothoracic exercises.1 However, at present, investigators still don't have any evidence suggesting if one treatment approach, the manual therapy and exercises or dry needling and exercises, is superior to the other in treating patients with the mechanical neck pain. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the effects of dry needling and manual therapy on pain, disability, range of motion, strength, and patient perceived improvements in the patients with mechanical neck pain. Methods: Investigators will conduct a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines. Patients with primary complain of neck pain, with a minimum score of 2 on Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), a minimum of 10 points or 20% score of Neck Disability Index (NDI), and who are over the age of 18 will be enrolled in the study. Subjects with any red flags, history of surgery at the cervical or thoracic spine, neurological symptoms, nerve root compression, whiplash in the last 6 weeks, pending legal actions related to neck pain, on workers compensation, insufficient English language skills, and/or contraindications to dry needling or manual therapy, will be excluded from the study. A total of 75 patients will be recruited for the study, who will be randomized to two groups - (1) Dry Needling and Therapeutic Exercises (DNTEx) and (2) Manual Therapy and Therapeutic Exercises (MTTEx). All participants will be treated for seven physical therapy treatment sessions of 30 minutes each over a maximum of 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure will NDI, which will evaluate disability of patients. While secondary outcome measures would be: NPRS (score range from 0 to 10) to assess pain, Patient-Specific Functional Scale \[PSFS\], (score ranges from 3 to 30) will measure a patient-specific measure of function important significant to them, Range of Motion (ROM) will measure changes in the motion of flexion, extension, bilateral rotation, and bilateral side-bending at the cervical spine, The Neck Flexor Endurance Test (NFET) will measure the improvement in the endurance of neck flexor muscles, Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ) will measure patients' fear of pain with movements and resulting avoidance of physical activity because of their fear, and The Patient Global Rating of Change (GROC) will measure each patient's self-perceived improvement. An assessor, who is blinded to the group allocation, will collect all outcome measures at baseline, 2weeks, discharge session/7th treatment session, and 3 months after discharge/7th treatment session. An a priori alpha level of 0.05 will be used for all analyses. Investigators will examine the primary aim with a repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as covariates, with treatment groups (Dry needling + Exercise Vs. MT + Exercise) as the between subjects' independent variables and time (baseline, 2 weeks, Discharge \[7 sessions\], 12 weeks post discharge) as the within-subjects independent variable. The hypothesis of interest is the 2-way group \* time interaction.

Oral Nitazoxanide in Acute Gastroenteritis in Australian Indigenous Children This is a multi-centre (RDH and ASH), phase IV, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Bayesian adaptive trial of oral NTZ for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis requiring admission to hospital. A maximum of 300 children aged between three months and less than five years of age will be enrolled. Study participation is from the point of enrolment until 60 days after enrolment. Enrolment will occur within 48 hours of admission to hospital. Enrolled participants will be randomised 1:1 to Nitazoxanide (NTZ) or placebo. Other treatment and management will be as per the standard of care described in the admitting hospital's guidelines and will be ultimately the decision and responsibility of the named medical consultant. Stool samples will be collected at the point of admission. Solicitation of symptoms will be by review of routinely collected medical data recorded in the participant's medical record, and will be supplemented by completion of study specific diary cards after discharge (for the first 210 enrolments). Attempts will be made to contact participants at day 7 after enrolment (by telephone if already discharged) to ascertain symptoms occurring in the intervening period. At days 30 and 60 (for first 210 enrolments ) and Day 60 (for enrolment #211 onwards) after enrolment a clinical record review will be conducted for all participants to ascertain health care attendances following discharge.
Peer Recovery to Improve Polysubstance Use and Mobile Telemedicine Retention The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a peer-led, brief, behavioral intervention to improve adherence to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and reduce polysubstance use among patients with OUD and polysubstance use in an underserved, rural area. The intervention is based on behavioral activation (BA) and is specifically designed to be implemented by a trained peer recovery specialist. In this hybrid, Type-1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial (RCT), the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of Peer Activate vs. treatment as usual (TAU) over twelve months.
Sleep Disturbances in the 2nd and 3rd Trimester Sleep disorders and disturbances are mostly underestimated in clinical practice. Moreover, this problem is generally neglected by the pregnant themselves. Today, it is important to underline any problem that may have an affect to improve the quality of life during pregnancy.  This study assesses the sleep quality, insomnia patterns and obstructive sleep apnea in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
PIC and Its Role in Progression of Pathological Myopia Aim of the work PIC in pathological myopia has not been well documented due to difficult in diagnosis we conducted this retrospective study to characterize the clinical features of PIC in high myopic eye.  * To show the diagnostic criteria of PIC lesions in high myopic patients. * Find out the prevalence of PIC related 'patchy atrophy' * To determine risk factor for developed PIC in a series of highly myopic patients. * Role of PIC in progression of high myopia. * Calculate the progression rate of PIC related lesion, by the size change during follow-up. * Search about complication of PIC in myopia. Patient and Methods This retrospective observational case series study included patients with high myopia who had been examined and followed-up in the High Myopia Clinic of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Approval from Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University was obtained, adhering to the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. Signed informed consent documentation was obtained from all participants.  All study participants underwent a detailed ophthalmologic examination at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The examinations included measurements of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using a Landolt C chart, refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, biometry for determination of axial length, (IOL Master; Carl Zeiss Meditec Co, Jena, Germany), fundus examination in medical mydriasis, fluorescein angiography, was performed with and colour fundus photography , and assessment of fundus autofluorescence (TRC-50DX; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) a or the Heidelberg Spectralis HRA system. Swept source Optical coherence tomography (OCT) used in assessment of the RPE and photoreceptors using a (DRI-OCT;Topcon, Tokyo, Japan). As scanning protocols, 9 mm or 6 mm radial with 12 equal meridian scans were performed. The swept-source OCT device has an A-scan repetition rate of 100 000 Hz, and its light source operates in the wavelength range of 1 μm.
Evaluation of Behavior, Executive Function, Neurotransmitter Function and Genomic Expression Kuvan Nonresponders This observational study seeks to establish evidence:  1. that physiologic changes, unrelated to effect on the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, occur in Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients who are treated with sapropterin (Kuvan®) therapy, 2. that these changes may be caused by enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain or an upregulation of gene expression (increasing the ability of genes to produce functional enzymes), 3. and that beneficial changes in behavior and cognition, especially executive functioning skills may result.  The objective of this study is to correlate any change in behavior and executive function skills of PKU patients who are non-responsive to sapropterin effect on the PAH enzyme, as defined by lowered blood PHE levels, with urine neurotransmitter levels and broad gene expression prior to and after sapropterin administration.  Expected outcomes would include evidence of sapropterin effects on upregulation of enzymes other than PAH that control neurotransmitter synthesis, and any resulting correlation with behavioral and cognitive changes.  The investigators hope this study will inform further detailed investigations into the biochemical and molecular actions of sapropterin (Kuvan®) that lead to increased understanding of possible treatment effects beyond a lowered blood PHE response.
Effect of Lipopolysaccharide on Skeletal Muscle Functions The investigators aim to examine how the skeletal muscles of the human volunteers respond to experimental septic conditions to aid understanding of muscle wasting and its biology..  Six healthy men aged 18-30 will be randomly assigned to two metabolic study visits. On the first visit, while resting on a bed, they will have four cannulae inserted including one in the upper thigh, for blood sampling and the infusion of insulin, glucose and normal and tracer amino acids (which allow us to measure muscle protein metabolism). Subjects will receive either injection of purified bacterial product called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce flu-like symptoms or normal saline according to randomization followed by a metabolic test to stimulate muscle synthesis and glucose transport. Three small samples of muscle will be obtained under local anaesthetic from the thigh to measure molecular events in muscle. By performing these measurements, the investigators will determine the consequences of LPS on muscle production and carbohydrate metabolism.
Exercise in Air Pollution and Lung Health in Asthmatics When exposed to air pollution, the asthma symptoms are aggravated and lung function is impaired. Due to high breathing rates and volumes, physically active individuals are at particular risk of lung health impairment due to the high breathing rates and volumes. Greater doses of air pollutants reach deeper areas in the lungs where they can trigger asthma-symptoms. When treating these symptoms with inhaled beta-2-agonists the airways widen even more, allowing the air pollutants to reach even deeper areas of the lung. With this study the investigators investigate how inhaled beta-2-agonists affect athletic capacity and lung health in physically active asthmatics.
The Impact of Sucrose Ingestion Post-Exercise on Liver and Muscle Glycogen Repletion. Carbohydrate is stored in the body as glycogen, which is mainly found in the liver and muscle. During endurance exercise, muscle glycogen is used as fuel for the working muscles and liver glycogen is broken down to provide glucose to maintain blood glucose (sugar) levels. Both liver and muscle glycogen are important for our ability to perform intense/prolonged endurance exercise. Therefore, it is important to replete these stores after an intense/prolonged endurance exercise session in order to recover and perform optimally during a subsequent exercise bout, especially if the next exercise session is within 24h (e.g. stage races such as the Tour de France, tournament-style competitions such as the Olympic games and ultra-endurance events).  Carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the availability of glycogen in the muscle and liver after exercise. The carbohydrates typically found in sports drinks are glucose and sometimes fructose. It has been observed that the ingestion of glucose will lead to a maximum rate of absorption of approximately \~1 g/min. However, if we also provide a different source of carbohydrate (fructose) then this is absorbed through a different pathway and therefore we can absorb up to \~1.75 g/min of carbohydrate. In addition, both carbohydrate sources are metabolised differently in the human body. By supplementing both glucose and fructose, we can potentially replenish the liver and muscle glycogen stores at a faster rate than ingestion of glucose only.  Sucrose is a naturally occurring sugar that is made up of a single glucose and single fructose molecule. Therefore, theoretically, this can use the two different pathways of absorption and also maximise carbohydrate delivery. It is not yet known however, what impact this has on our liver and muscle glycogen stores post-exercise when supplemented in relatively high amounts. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess whether relative high amounts of sucrose ingestion will improve liver and muscle glycogen repletion after endurance exercise.

Prediction of the Effect of Fluid Administration Using Arterial Pressure and Ventilator Data During Abdominal Surgery It is well known, that patients with circulatory impairment sometimes, but not always, benefit from intravenous fluids. Predicting if a fluid administration will improve circulation is therefore of substantial clinical interest.  Ventilator treatment induces cyclic variation in blood pressure due to interaction between the lungs and the heart. This variation is minor, but its amplitude may be used for guiding fluid administration.  However, this method of using ventilator-induced variation in blood pressure to predict the effect of fluid administration was developed when different settings for ventilator treatment was recommended, compared with today. With today's recommend ventilator treatment, the method is, unfortunately, less reliable.  The investigators will investigate how different ventilator settings influence variation in blood pressure, and the investigators will test if this knowledge allows us to better predict the effect of a fluid administration, by taking the ventilator settings into account.
VRC 308: An Open-Label Phase I Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of an Investigational H1 DNA Influenza Vaccine, VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP, in Healthy Adults 18-70 Years Old Background:  * Vaccines are substances used to try to create resistance (or immunity) to a disease and to prevent an infection. Researchers are testing a new DNA vaccine designed for a new type of influenza, often referred to as swine flu. The DNA vaccine will instruct the body to make a particular kind of influenza protein that the immune system will be able to recognize. * Researchers are interested in determining if the vaccine is safe and effective in humans, and would like to study the immune system's response to the vaccine. The vaccine will not give participants influenza; however, it may not be effective in preventing them from getting influenza at a later date.  Objectives:  * To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the VRC-FLUDNA057-00-VP influenza vaccine as administered to healthy adults. * To evaluate antibody responses to the new influenza vaccine.  Eligibility:  - Healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 70.  Design:  * Participants will have seven planned clinic visits during this study (enrollment day and study weeks 1, 4, 8, 9, 12, and 32). * All participants will receive three injections of the test vaccine, given as individual doses on day 0, day 28, and day 56 of the study. The vaccine will be given in the upper arm muscle. * Injections will be given using a needleless system that delivers the vaccine through the skin by using the pressure of carbon dioxide to inject the vaccine through the skin and into the muscle. Participants will remain at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for at least 30 minutes after the injection to be monitored for any reaction. * Participants will be asked to keep a 7-day diary card after each injection to record their physical reactions to the vaccine. * Participants will be asked to return to the NIH Clinical Center as requested by researchers for additional blood tests and other procedures, as required by the study.

Clinical Application of Super-resolution Ultrasound(SR-US) Imaging in Solid Tumors It has well accepted that tumor angiogenesis present aberrant vascular architecture and functional abnormalities, which is associated with tumorigenesis, tumor propagation and progression. By locating, separating and tracking microbubbles, the recently introduced and upgraded Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) surpassed classical wave diffraction limit. However, the acquisition of structural and functional parameters of microcirculation in vivo for ULM is still confined by the compromise between the resolution and penetration depth. The relatively long acquisition time induced the difficulty of motion correction potentially, which hampers the preclinical to clinical application in organs with distinct tissue motion such as the liver. Therefore, we take the lead in studying human liver lesion microvasculature, which remains a challenge for noninvasive, quantitative and functional intravital imaging especially due to its deep-seated location and strong motion. We developed a Super-resolution Ultrasound (SR-US) imaging technique based on ULM to assess its feasibility of visualizing and quantifying microvasculature in human organs.
Analysis of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer and Macular Thickness After Congenital Cataract Surgery Congenital cataract is the main cause of form deprivation amblyopia in children. Current studies confirm that form deprivation amblyopia affects the retinal nerve fiber layer. However, there are different opinions about the effect of amblyopia on the optic nerve fiber thickness around the optic disc at home and abroad. Investigators have performed "cataract extraction with IOL implantation" on children with bilateral and unilateral congenital cataract. Investigators used OCT biometry to measure children's the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFLT) and macular thickness (CMT) before and after surgery. Investigators dynamically observed changes in RNFL and CMT to explore the retinal mechanism of form deprivation amblyopia and help guide the clinical correct understanding of postoperative follow-up time.
Role of CBD in Regulating Meal Time Anxiety in Anorexia Nervosa No studies of cannabidiol (CBD) have focused on Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Dose, side effects, tolerability, acceptability of pure CBD in AN must be established. The current study is an important first step in the investigation of CBD for AN. Cannabis products have been recently legalized in many states, and CBD in particular has been shown to reduce anxiety. Therefore, CBD may represent a promising new treatment for AN. The endocannabinoid system is involved in the regulation of functions relevant to eating disorders. Furthermore, data suggest that eating disorders are associated with alterations of the endocannabinoid system. Prior attempts to target the endocannabinoid system in AN have focused on CB1 receptor agonists that can increase anxiety. Moreover, CBD may be particularly beneficial in decreasing anxiety in AN via its action at serotonin receptors. Lastly, the impact of CBD on eating behavior and weight in AN must be determined. The current study seeks to explore these hypotheses using the aims in the following section.

Long-term Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Improve the Prognosis of Myocardial Infarction Patients With Emergency Reperfusion Therapy Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are in critical condition. When primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performing, no-reflow, reperfusion injury，heart failure, heart rupture, malignant arrhythmia maybe happen. It was reported remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may play an effective endogenous cardiac protection. This study will investigate whether once RIPC before primary PCI or long-term RIPC can improve AMI patients short-term and long-term (1 year) prognosis. 400 STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI were randomly divided into 3 groups: long-term RIPC group (once preoperative RIPC and once RIPC/day after PCI), preoperative RIPC group (once preoperative RIPC), control group (without RIPC). Cardiac troponin (TNI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adenosine, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), echocardiography and magnetic resonance （MR）were detected 1 day, 1 month and 1 year after PCI. Patients will be followed up by telephone at the end of one year. The major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) include cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization and stroke.

Safety and Efficacy of Different Irrigation System in Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery Urolithiasis is one of the most prevalent urological diseases affecting general population across the world. The available treatment modalities for renal stones are Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PNL), and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS). Irrigation for RIRS is the critical component for the success of procedure. To avoid detrimental effects of high pressure, intra-renal pressure (IRP) has to be lower. Different studies have shown that high irrigation pressure raises intra-renal pressure leading to pyelo-venous and pyelo-lymphatic reflux which can lead to sepsis and septic shock. Comparative study of different irrigation pressure during RIRS is lacking.  This is randomized controlled trial conducted in Department of Urology and Renal Transplant Surgery for duration of one year. Objective of the study is to compare safety and efficacy of gravity irrigation versus pressure irrigation. Patients with symptomatic kidney stones: non lower pole stones \<2cm, lower pole stones \<1cm and lower pole stones 1-2 cm in whom PCNL is contraindicated will be enrolled in study with informed consent. Retrograde intrarenal surgery will be performed as standard procedure and Ho:YAG laser will be used to fragment stones.  Stone free rate at postoperative day 1 and after 1 month will be monitored through X-ray KUB. Maximum irrigation pressure, duration of surgery, stone size, density, location, intraoperative and postoperative complications as classified by Clavien-Dindo will be noted for all patients. Data will be appropriately analyzed and statistical tests applied as necessary.

Percutaneous Continuous Irrigation Combined With Transgastric Necrosectomy usingLAMS in Treatment of SAP Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is the most severe form of acute pancreatitis (AP) and Infection of pancreatic necrosis (IPN) have shown to be one of the decisive factors defining the severity of illness.  Minimally invasive techniques including endoscopy, laparoscopy, retroperitoneal approaches, etc., have recently been widely used for debridement because the procedure can further reduces surgical stress and performed not require general anesthesia, thereby reducing complications. Studies have shown that endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy can significantly reduced the proinflammatory response, complications, and hospital stay. Despite these advantages, there are some limitations with this approach. First, transgastric necrosectomy should be performed as late (about 4 weeks) in the course of the disease as possible to allow necrosis to wrap, since early debridement may result in a higher patient fatality rate. However, patients with SAP are often in a severely ill state due to sepsis or MODS at an early stage, which causes them unable to adhere to necrotic tissue encapsulation by conservative treatment. Second, the ideal patient to select for this approach has necrosis confined in the vicinity of gastroduodenal location. Last, up to 27% of IPN patients require additional percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) after undergoing endoscopic transluminal therapy. This may be explained by the fact that dissemination of necrosis, digestive enzymes and inflammatory mediators from the necrotic tissue lumen to other parts of the abdominal cavity during endoscopic procedures.  Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) has always been the principal treatment measure for patients with AP at early stage (\< 4 weeks) or those with collections or necrosis extending into deeper anatomical planes. Irrigation through peripancreatic drainage placed after open laparotomy has been the standard treatment for patients with AP who had undergone surgical necrosectomy. However, this proactive approach has not been widely used in the setting of PCD.  To adequate drainage and removal of necrosis, an early percutaneous continuous irrigation assisted vacuum drainage in combination with subsequent endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy which has not been reported so far was applied in critically ill patients with SAP.

This study will determine whether BNP guided therapy could reduce doses of indomethacin.
Evaluating Harms and Benefits of Endocrine Therapy in Patients ≥70 Years of Age With Lower Risk Breast Cancer The current standard of care for stage 1 hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer consists of breast-conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) and endocrine therapy (ET) for at least 5 years. The benefit of adjuvant ET for older patients is mitigated because of their increase risk of death from other causes and shorter time horizon to live. Clinical and pathological factors such as low-intermediate grade, tumor size ≤2 cm, and older age have been used in a few studies to identify patients with a lower risk of recurrence that might benefit from adjuvant therapy de-escalation, i.e. omission of RT or ET. Since there is no dedicated randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted to evaluate the omission of ET, there is clinical equipoise as to whether we can omit adjuvant ET in older patients with lower-risk early-stage breast cancer. Therefore, we propose a randomised, multicentre trial evaluating harms and benefits of endocrine therapy in patients ≥70 years of age with lower risk breast cancer.

Evaluation of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Group for Adjustment Difficulties in Neurological Conditions With an increase of over 38% in neurological related hospital admissions between 2008-13, there are now over 12.5 million cases of individuals with neurological conditions in the UK. Following diagnosis of a neurological condition, there is often a period of adjustment to new life circumstances, with changes to relationships, ability to work and leisure activities. With a future often fraught with uncertainty, psychological difficulties such as Anxiety and Depression are common. It is estimated that following diagnosis of a neurological condition, up to 60% of individual's will experience mental health difficulties.  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been gaining popularity in supporting those with neurological conditions. ACT is based on emotional acceptance and supporting individuals to live a valued life, despite ongoing symptoms. Research into the use of ACT with this population has found it to be effective in reducing levels of psychological distress and increasing psychological flexibility.  With limited resources and an ever increasing desire to improve interventions offered to patients, services are now looking at new and innovative ways of offering increasingly effective and satisfactory treatments. Therefore, in early 2014, the author devised a six week ACT group intervention for adjustment following diagnosis of a neurological condition. The intervention provides a combination of ACT techniques, in addition to a space for group members to build relationships and share their difficulties, to help individuals increase acceptance of their difficulties and reduce psychological distress.  Following an initial pilot, findings illustrated that participants' psychological distress reduced and psychological flexibility increased. Therefore, this research project aims to further evaluate the intervention under controlled conditions.

Azacitidine, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of azacitidine when given together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Azacitidine may also help cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work better by making the cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs
CHARISMA Expansion Study The CHARISMA Expansion Study is a two-arm, randomized (1:1), controlled study of a behavioral intervention-the Community Health clinic model for Agency in Relationships and Safer Microbicide Adherence (CHARISMA)-to reduce social harms (SHs) and intimate partner violence (IPV), increase healthy relationship dynamics and oral PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) TDF/FTC (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine), hereafter called PrEP, adherence among enrolled women. This study is an expansion of the CHARISMA intervention pilot study which was appended to the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN)-025 HOPE (HIV Open Label Prevention Extension) study.  CHARISMA is defined by the use of a tool, called the CHARISMA HEAlthy Relationship Assessment Tool (HEART) used in combination with three counselling modules:  * Module A: General Partner Communication and Relationship Skills * Module B: Partner Disclosure and Communication around PrEP Use * Module C: Responding to Intimate Partner Violence and Safety Planning

Topical Treatment With Fresh Human Milk Versus Emollient on Atopic Eczema Spots in Young Children The aim of this small pilot study is to assess the potential effects and risks of applying fresh human milk locally on eczema spots in children with atopic eczema. This is a split body, controlled, randomized and physician blinded pilot study, of children with atopic eczema with two similar contralateral eczema spots having a mother breastfeeding the child or a sibling. Fresh expressed milk and emollient is to be applied on the intervention spot and emollient alone on the control area, three times a day for four weeks. Severity and area of the eczema spots is evaluated weekly, and samples from milk and the spots were analysed weekly with respect to bacterial colonisation.
Clinical Decision Support to Prevent Suicide Suicide kills 132 Americans every day. The first step of suicide prevention is risk identification and prognostication. Researchers like this study team have developed and validated predictive models that use routinely collected Electronic Health Record (EHR) data like past diagnoses and medications to predict future suicide attempt risk. The study team's model based in machine learning is known as the Vanderbilt Suicide Attempt and Ideation Likelihood (VSAIL). VSAIL has been validated prospectively and externally to predict suicide attempt risk with a number needed to screen (NNS) of 271 for suicide attempt and 23 for suicidal ideation. NNS is the number of people who need to receive a test result to prevent one outcome - lower NNS is better.  This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a Clinical Decision Support System called Vanderbilt Safecourse using VSAIL to prompt a novel Best Practice Advisory (BPA) to prompt face-to-face screening with a validated suicide screening instrument like the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS).
Ultrasound-guided IUD Insertion During Family Medicine Residency Training The objective of this pilot study is to test that hypothesis that ultrasound guided IUD placement by family medicine residents improves patient pain scores, procedure completion time, and procedure complication rates. The secondary objective is to test the hypothesis that ultrasound guided IUD placement improves resident confidence in performing the procedure. A prospective, randomized controlled pilot study will be conducted in the Department of Academic Family Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan. All women undergoing IUD placement (hormonal or non-hormonal) at West Winds Primary Care Center from Mar 1, 2020- Mar 1, 2021 will be invited to participate. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient and the resident inserting the IUD prior to initiating study procedures. The control group will comprise 20 women undergoing non-ultrasound guided IUD placement. The experimental group will comprise 20 women undergoing transabdominal ultrasound guided IUD placement. Patient pain scores and resident confidence scores will be tabulated using likert scales and compared between control and experimental groups using independent sample t-tests. Procedure completion time (minutes) will be compared between groups using t-tests. Procedure complications rates will be categorized as: a) inability to penetrate the cervix, b) improper location, c) inability to release the IUD from the insertion device, d) perforation, e) vasovagal reactions, and f) post-procedure infection; outcomes will be compared between groups using Chi-square analyses.
Study of PH3 for the Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women The primary objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PH3 for the prevention of osteoporosis.

Feasibility Study of Smoking Cessation for the Staff of a Hospital Center The recorded prevalence of daily smoking among health professionals (doctors, nurses, midwives, etc.), regardless of their mode of practice (salaried or self-employed, etc.) varies between 14 and 23%. In health care institutions, according to the studies, the prevalence of daily smoking among staff, caregivers and non-caregivers ranges from 17% to 27%. These professionals who continue to smoke, although they are particularly well informed about the risks they run, probably constitute a group with specific withdrawal difficulties. Beyond the impact on their own health, the smoking status of caregivers could also have an impact on the management of tobacco patients. There are very few studies of the impact of interventions on the smoking status of caregivers in health care facilities. The combination of several intervention modalities can facilitate the participation of target professionals and generate efficiency synergies.
Transplant Wellness Clinic for Elderly or High Risk Patients Undergoing BMT As the average age of individuals undergoing stem cell transplant continues to increase, challenges associated with balancing the side effects of cancer treatments while also managing other medical conditions develop. Studies have shown these individuals develop more treatment related side effects and take longer to leave the hospital due to complications. The purpose of this study is to develop a multiple provider clinic that will help identify any additional needs in the more complicated and generally older transplant patient population. If needed, this clinic will recommend interventions or referrals to the appropriate specialties to the participant and the transplant physician for the participant before your transplant procedure. Examples of potential areas of improvement include a course of physical therapy, nutritional supplements, or modifications of medications, among others with the goal to make your transplant safer and to decrease length of time in the hospital.

Effect of the Early Ultrasound-guided Femoral Nerve Block Performed by Emergency Physicians on Pre-operative Opioids Usage in Patients With Proximal Femoral Fractures In France, approximately 80,000 patients with a fracture of the upper extremity of the femur (femoral neck or trochanter) are admitted in the emergency department. This is a serious disease with a one-year mortality rate of 29% (i.e., 1 of 5 women and 1 of 3 men), and significant consequences on quality of life and autonomy. The morbidity of these fractures is closely related to the occurrence of altered mental status or delirium, before and after surgery. The diagnosis is based on clinical features and x-rays of the hip. These fractures are associated with severe level of pain, before and after the surgery. For emergency physicians, managing appropriately the pain is a common problem at the admission in the emergency room. Proper pain management is essential to ensure patients' comfort before surgery, but also to ensure their return to their previous functional and cognitive state after surgery. For patients, the goal of treatment is to regain walking as quickly as possible, while minimizing surgical and medical complications. However, severe pain induced by the fracture may lead to an acute altered mental status or delirium. In France, the latest guidelines about analgesia in emergency medicine reported that local anesthesia and loco-regional anesthesia (LRA) are useful and should be promoted in emergency medicine. In 2010, these guidelines proposed to perform LRA techniques such as iliofascial block more widely available. In 2016, the largest review of the literature on the use of regional nerve blocks for hip and femoral neck fractures in the emergency department \[MEDLINE (1946-2014), EMBASE (1947-2014), CINAHL (1960-2014), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials\] indicated that the femoral nerve block was likely to be at least as effective as, if not superior to, standard analgesic practices for decreasing pain after ESF fracture.  The authors of the meta-analysis suggested the superiority of ultrasound guidance compared to anatomic techniques or use of neurostimulation for an adequate needle placement. Despite the increasing availability of ultrasound in the emergency department, recent literature supporting the efficacy of ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block, and the improvement of ultrasound skills in routine emergency medicine practice, the literature lacks of data about the effective duration of action, medication influence, and the occurrence of complications when an ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block is used by emergency physicians at the admission.  For patients with hip fractures, it is questioned if ultrasound-guided femoral block used early on admission in the emergency room is in more efficient than intravenous morphine titration in reducing opioid use before surgery? Our hypothesis is that early use of ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block in the emergency room decreases preoperative opioid use (intravenous and/or oral) in patients with proximal femoral fractures.
The Effect of Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation on Reducing Oesophageal Pain Hypersensitivity We are evaluating the role of transcutaneous electrical vagal nerve stimulation in the prevention of oesophageal pain hypersensitivity using a validated human model in healthy volunteers.
Cluster RCT on the Effect of the Topics Number in Oral Health Educational Video Among Preschool Children. Purpose: This cluster randomized controlled trials study aims to investigate whether different number of topics delivered through educational video affect the oral health status, knowledge, attitude and practice of preschool children.  Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this study is the number of topics covered in educational videos aimed at preschool children will have a direct impact on their oral health status.  The specific hypothesis is the educational videos covering wide range of oral health topics will lead to better oral health outcomes in preschool children compared to videos focusing on limited number of topics. The higher number of topics delivered in educational video, the better oral health status, knowledge, attitude, and practice.  The alternative hypothesis is the combination of three topics on effective toothbrushing technique, effects of sugary food, and dental caries is effective to led to the most improvement in oral health status, knowledge, attitudes, and practices compared to two or only one topic.  Objectives: The objectives of this study were divided into primary and secondary.  The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of different number of topics in educational video versus placebo video on mean difference in plaque score and gingival score among preschool children at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention.  The secondary objective is to assess the effect of different number of topics in educational video versus placebo video on mean difference in knowledge, attitude and practice score among preschool children at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention.  Participants: The study will involve 124 preschool children aged five to six years old.  Methods: Researchers will randomize classes in the school into five clusters using closed enveloped technique. These five clusters will be randomly assigned either into interventional groups or control groups. There are four intervention groups and one control group. Each intervention group will be compared to a control group for mean difference in plaque, gingival and KAP score at baseline and after intervention.  Duration: The study is expected to last 6 months (from subjects recruitment to final research report) with regular updates on progress.  Location: The study will be conducted at a preschool in Kota Bharu Kelantan.
An Efficacy and Safety Study of Tacrolimus Ointment in Adult Participants With Atopic Dermatitis The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in treating the signs and symptoms of moderate (medium level of seriousness) to severe (very serious, life threatening) atopic dermatitis (an intensely pruritic \[itching\], chronic \[lasting a long time\], inflammatory \[pain and swelling\], immunologically based skin disease with a genetic predisposition \[latent susceptibility to disease at the genetic level\]) in adult participants.
ECoLoGiC Speech Therapy for Everyday Communication in Aphasia The primary goal of this clinical trial study is to evaluate the effect of a new therapy to improve talking in people with the language disability 'aphasia' after a stroke. The therapy is called: 'Expanding Communication and Language Generated in Conversation Treatment' (ECoLoGiC Treatment), and helps improve language skills for talking to other people in conversation. The second goal is to develop training materials to teach families of people with aphasia about the therapy and how to practice at home. This part of the study will be completed with help from two people with aphasia and a family member who have completed the program.  The study asks:  1. How do people with aphasia improve their language skills following this therapy? Results will be determined by using tests of language and by testing language in conversation and other types of talking tasks, like describing a picture. 2. After completing the family training, do family members use the ideas they learned when talking to the person with aphasia? And, what do family members and people with aphasia think of the family training? The first question will be answered with a checklist to see if the family members followed the ideas they learned. The second question will be answered by talking with the people with aphasia and the family members to find out what they thought.  The people with aphasia will complete language testing before and after therapy, and 6 weeks later (to see if improvements are maintained). Therapy is twice a week for one hour, for 10 weeks with a speech-language pathologist. During therapy, the person will have casual conversations with the speech-language pathologist, who will help the person communicate by giving small amounts of help at a time. The speech-language pathologist will tell the person what they are doing that does and does not help with communication. This process helps the person use more language and learn how to communicate better. The family members will have training with the speech-language pathologists to learn about the therapy and how to continue with the ideas at home. Training will take place over 3 sessions, scheduled in addition to therapy sessions. After therapy ends, the family members will have conversations with the person with aphasia, to show what they have learned. Each family member and person with aphasia will also have a 10-20 minute conversation with a researcher to share their thoughts about the training program.

Epigenetic Effects on Traumatic Brain Injury Recovery Methylation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is involved in both the biological encoding of childhood adversity and neuroplasticity following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This research will characterize BDNF methylation during recovery from TBI in children and investigate this novel biomarker as a potential biological mechanism underlying the known association between childhood adversity and poorer neurobehavioral outcomes following TBI in childhood. Findings from this research will contribute to an improved understanding of why some children display good recovery following TBI, whereas many others suffer from chronic neurobehavioral impairments.
Imposed Pursed Lip Breathing at Rest and During Exercise In COPD A randomized control trial was conducted at physiotherapy department of Pakistan Railway General Hospital from July 2017 to Dec 2017. 30 patients with stable COPD were enrolled in the study on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The participants were randomly assigned into two groups, Group A= interventional group, Group B = control group through toss and coin method using non-probability convenient sampling technique and written consent was obtained from each patient participated in the study. From 30 patients 15 patients were randomly allocated to each group, Group A: Interventional (n= 15), Group B: Control (n=15). 1 patient in control group B was dropout because he didn't come for follow up. Overall 29 patients were evaluated for study as in Group A, interventional (n=15) and Group B control (n=14).Patients in group A were performed breathing control at the start of session and then Purse lips breathing technique during aerobic bicycling for 8 min while in group B patients first perform breathing control and then aerobic bicycling for 8 min. Subjects in both experimental and control group underwent spirometry and baseline vitals, such as Respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, at rest and at the completion of session was noted. Borg scale of dyspnea also used to rate the level of dyspnea at rest and at the end of session. Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) was used at 1st and final week of evaluation. It was 6 weeks training protocol, with three days per week session was given to the patient.

Sargramostim and Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Did Not Respond to Previous Chemotherapy RATIONALE: Colony stimulating factors, such as sargramostim (GM-CSF), may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing and may also increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving GM-CSF together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may be an effective treatment for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer.  PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving GM-CSF together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation works in treating patients with advanced ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that did not respond to previous chemotherapy
Incidence of Sleep-disordered Breathing and Upper Airway Collapsibility in Postpartum Patients and Its Intervention The investigators hypothesized that sleeping in a 45 degrees elevated body position decreases the likelihood of upper airway vulnerability to collapse early after delivery.

Seizure Prophylaxis in Aneurysm Repair Seizures are a potential complication of surgical repair of intracranial aneurysms. In order to prevent seizures, many surgeons administer prophylactic anti-epileptic medication during the intra-operative and post-operative period, however, such practice is not supported by clinical data. Retrospective review found the incidence of postoperative seizures was higher in those who received anti-epileptics versus those who did not. The goal is to examine the utility of levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgical repair of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

TissueLink Study During Multi-Level Spine Surgery The overall objective of the investigators research is to test the clinical efficacy of the TissueLink™ (Salient Surgical Technologies, Inc.) coagulation system in minimizing hemoglobin loss intraoperatively. This is a prospective, randomized investigation that will be performed at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC). The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Tissue Link HemoSealing system in minimizing hemoglobin loss preoperatively, intraoperatively and postoperatively for patients undergoing multilevel elective spinal surgery. Not greater than eighty patients scheduled for elective, multi-level decompression and fusion spinal surgery with Dr. William Richardson will be randomized into two groups. Unipolar electrocautery will be used for intraoperative coagulation in one group and the Tissuelink device plus Unipolar electrocautery in the other. These are frequently performed cases with significant blood loss but otherwise low morbidity/mortality that would benefit from more effective intraoperative coagulation.
High Polygenic Risk and Health Behavior The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of awareness of high polygenic risk for CVD on health behavior among young overweight adults. We want to evaluate the impact of awareness of high polygenic risk for CVD on body mass index within 12 months, the impact of awareness of high polygenic risk for CVD on other health indicators (physical activity, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, smoking, waist circumference, CVD risk score), and assess the cost-effectiveness of informing people about the high polygenic risk for CVD.  The trial will be conducted in a primary care setting, for which the high genetic-risk subjects will be invited to visit their family physician. In the course of the first visit, the family physician will assess the participant's health status and will counsel the participant on healthy choices for increasing their level of physical activity and losing weight. If necessary, the family physician will start treatment to lower the participant's blood pressure or cholesterol following current treatment guidelines. The participants in the intervention group will be informed of their high polygenic risk for CVD at the start of the study, while the control subjects at the end of the study. There will be three study visits at 6-month intervals. Between visits, the participants will receive reminders via a mobile health application to change their health behavior. At the end of the trial (month 12), the health indicators of the participants will be assessed and compared between the three trial groups. If a significant difference in BMI is found, it will presumably be related to the fact of learning of the high genetic risk, in which case the use of genetic data in primary prevention may be considered effective.
A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of V114 When Administered Concomitantly With Influenza Vaccine in Healthy Adults 50 Years of Age or Older (V114-021/PNEU-FLU) This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of V114 when administered concomitantly and non-concomitantly (i.e., 30 days after) with influenza vaccine. It also evaluated whether V114 can be administered concomitantly with influenza vaccine without impairing the antibody response to the 15 serotypes contained in V114 and to the 4 influenza viruses contained in the seasonal inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). The primary hypotheses state that immune responses to V114 and to QIV are non-inferior when administered concomitantly as compared with non-concomitant administration as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 30 days postvaccination. This study will also contribute to the overall safety database and immunogenicity data for V114 to support initial licensure in adults.

Non-invasive Characterization of the Mechanisms of Atrial Fibrillation Maintenance Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) have a limited efficacy and often cause long-term side effects. Pulmonary vein isolation is the therapy of choice in drug-refractory patients. Recent studies have shown that ablation have a greater efficacy in patients in whom AF is maintained hierarchically and after ablation of rotors. The non-invasive identification of specific mechanism of AF maintenance in each patient could allow the selection of the most appropriate treatment.
How to Best Treat Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries The project is a pragmatic registry-based RCT aiming to investigate ACL injury treatment. Study results will help fill knowledge gaps, facilitate shared decision making and strengthen patient treatment.  Included patients will be randomized to (1) early ACL surgery followed by rehabilitation or (2) active rehabilitation with optional delayed surgery if indicated.  Randomization and data collection is conducted through the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry (NNKLR) which is a well established population based ACL registry. Participation is based on informed consent to participate in the NNKLR and the registry-based RCT. The study uses the platform and outcome measures of the NNKLR to collect and measure data. The data will be stored as usual in the NNKLR, but RCT specific data will be exported for analysis and stored inTjenester for sensitive data (TSD). Data collected in NNKLR are: patient data (age, height, weight, activity level, smoking-and snuff habits), knee injury data (injury data, injury mechanism, additional knee injury), treatment (non-operative or ACL reconstruction, reoperation), surgical details (operation date, antibiotics, anti-coagulants, graft type and size, approach for femoral tunnel, additional injury and additional surgical procedure) and patient reported knee function at baseline, 2, 5 and 10 years. Also, x-rays and MRIs will be imported for included patients and stored in TSD.

Live After an Epithelial Ovarian Cancer: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Effects and Long-term Remission in Patients Needs. This project is part of a large multicenter multidisciplinary program that will thoroughly explore the needs and difficulties of patients with BCR as well as those involved in their care. The results of this research program will propose recommendations for better structure and understand the follow up of these patients.  From the limited data in the literature, the long-term remission in patients with ovarian cancer reported a significant and persistent fatigue, poor QoL, disorders of sexuality as well as somatic and mental illness; consumption is also a medical records for these patients.  In this context, our team has initiated a large case-control study to assess fatigue (identified major problem in the long-term remission in patients with ovarian cancer), QoL and rehabilitation of patients in remission from an epithelial ovarian cancer (regardless of the stage of cancer at diagnosis, early or advanced) 3 years after the initial treatment, compared with women of the same age without ovarian cancer or serious chronic disease , from the general population.  Patients and controls complement standardized and validated self-administered questionnaire (part 1). This study investigated 215 patients in long remission from ovarian cancer compared to 215 women of the same age without cancer. Recruitment of patients is currently underway, in close collaboration with teams from the Group GINECO very involved in this project.  Following this step, an additional component is planned: it is to offer patients who participated in part 1, a specific gynecological consultation to assess in detail the effects of the treatments in order to better meet the needs of patients .dropoff window

Short Active Lives Survey in Chronic Lung Conditions Short Actives Lives Survey is a common tool used to measure physical activity in the UK population. Self-reported measures such as the Short Active Lives Survey can be prone to bias. As such, during project evaluations, benefits may be exaggerated due to over-reporting of physical activity or downplayed due to underreporting of physical activity. There is also a lack of research reporting the typical short-term and long-term changes in physical activity (measured by the Short Active Lives Survey) in people with chronic lung conditions who are not receiving support to become active (i.e. usual care, control groups). Accelerometers are small lightweight activity monitors that can be worn on the waist. These monitors are known to provide accurate and reliable objective assessment of physical activity in people with lung conditions.  This research study will recruit a cohort of inactive people with lung conditions and determine changes in physical activity measured by both the Short Active Lives Survey and one of the most valid accelerometers used in people with lung conditions (Actigraph GT3X). The study will also evaluate how these physical activity measures relate to general health (health status and health care use) of people with lung conditions over 12 months. This study will provide information on the usefulness of using the Short Active Lives Survey in the future for measuring physical activity in people with lung conditions.

Development & Pilot RCT of an Online Peer Support Program for Family Caregivers of Ventilator-Assisted Individuals Ventilator assisted individuals (VAIs) living at home are frail and generally cannot perform most daily activities. Although these individuals prefer to live at home, the family members who care for them often experience stress and poor health. Peer support can mitigate health declines by decreasing caregivers' isolation/stress and increasing their sense of control. However, no peer support programs are designed to meet these caregivers' complex and unique needs. Online support delivery is especially beneficial for caregivers given the geographic and time limitations they face. The proposed research aims to develop and conduct an RCT of online peer support program for VAI caregivers. A group of caregivers will be trained to act as peer mentors. This training program will be evaluated for its impact on caregivers' mentoring abilities. At the end of the 12-week program, caregiving participants will be asked about the online delivery of the program, how helpful/satisfactory it was, and if it affected their health and well-being. The health outcomes of the control and intervention group will be compared. This peer support program can improve the well-being of caregivers and allow them to better care for their family members.

According to results of basic animal and in vitro investigations, hyperoxemia may activate platelets by means of reactive oxygen species. This study aims at investigating a possible pro-coagulant effect of hyperoxemia in healthy volunteers. Additional studies on possible mechanisms are integrated.  * Trial with medical device
The Effects of General Anesthetics on Upper Airway Collapsibility in Healthy Subjects The investigators hypothesize that propofol, when compared to sevoflurane, causes the upper airway to collapse more easily and causes less activity in the tongue muscle. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that, under increased carbon dioxide concentrations of the air inhaled, the upper airway will be less likely to collapse under anesthesia and there will be increased activity in the tongue muscle under both propofol and sevoflurane, when compared to breathing normal concentrations of carbon dioxide, as in room air. Furthermore the investigators hypothesize that anesthesia disrupt the breathing swallow coordination, an effect additionally altered by increased carbon dioxide through increased respiratory drive.

Early Molecular Detection Technique Coupled With Urinary Test of Infectious Agents Responsible of Children CAP Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) of children are a recurrent pathology with multiple severity scores. The etiology is never really identified, and the initial treatment is always based on probabilistic antibiotics, in the case of an bacterial infection, and by the way, potentially severe.  Molecular tests ("multiplex") allow the simultaneous detection of a huge number of pathogenic agents, virus and bacteria, are now available.  This project is based on a new strategy of diagnostic, using a multiplex PCR with quick results, coupled to an antigenic urinary test to allow a complete, quick, etiologic diagnostic as soon as children are supported in emergency.  Children are randomized in two groups during inclusions : quick diagnostic strategy versus usual practice. Analyse will be centralized on anti-infectious treatment optimization, with the aim to better treat patients, minimize the costs, and decrease selection pressure of multi-resistant bacteria.

Why am I Still Tired ? A Group for Cancer-related Fatigue Cancer related fatigue (CRF) has been defined as a "distressing, persistent, subjective sense of tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning". CRF has been found to affect between 59-99% of patients undergoing active treatment. Approximately a third of cancer survivors will continue to experience moderate to severe fatigue upwards of 10 years post-diagnosis. Given the prominence of CRF, guidelines for the assessment and management of CRF have been developed, including guidelines by the Canadian Association for Psychosocial Oncology (CAPO). Despite the availability of guidelines for CRF and a plethora of interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness in aiding patients manage CRF, implementation has been lacking. The objective of this study is to adapt, implement, and evaluate an already existing intervention for CRF in the community using the Knowledge-to-Action framework. This study is an implementation study and evaluation of an evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for CRF in a community setting. An evident knowledge to practice gap exists for CRF management in Ottawa, Canada. Through partnership with a community organization, the Ottawa Regional Cancer Foundation, and an emphasis on long-term sustainability, this project aims to provide more accessible treatment for cancer survivors who are experiencing CRF in the Ottawa region.

Evaluation of a Male-specific Psychotherapeutic Program for Major Depressive Disorders This project aims to evaluate a male-specific psychotherapeutic program (MSPP) for MDD based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The primary goal is to test the superiority of the MSPP. This will be conducted in two groups of depressed men, namely eudonadal depressed men and hypogonadal depressed men receiving testosterone treatment (TT). In a randomized study design, the MSPP will be compared to a standard CBT and a waitlist control group, resulting in a total of six study groups. Both standardized psychotherapy programs will encompass 18 sessions delivered in a weekly manner, starting at study week 6 and continuing until study week 24. Aligned with the TT-related medical visits of the hypogonadal men, all participants will be followed up with clinical assessments and biosampling at weeks 0, 6, 15, 24, 36. In addition, a separate healthy control group will be examined, which will undergo only baseline assessments.

Donor Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant With or Without Ex-vivo Expanded Cord Blood Progenitor Cells in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or Myelodysplastic Syndromes This randomized phase II trial studies how well donor umbilical cord blood transplant with or without ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's cells. When the healthy stem cells and ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not yet known whether giving donor umbilical cord blood transplant plus ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells is more effective than giving a donor umbilical cord blood transplant alone.
Over-arousal as a Mechanism Between Alcohol and Intimate Partner Violence Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health problem costing $8.3 billion per year with over $6 billion in direct medical and mental health costs alone. Alcohol is present in most incidents of IPV, and contributes to more frequent and severe IPV incidents. These facts, coupled with the fact that there are no effective interventions for IPV, make understanding mechanisms through which alcohol is associated with IPV critical.

Lapatinib and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Lapatinib may help paclitaxel work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Lapatinib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lapatinib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.  PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lapatinib when given together with paclitaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

Randomized Controlled Trial of Vaginal Progesterone in Women With Threatened Preterm Labor Prematurity remains the most important single factor in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the rate of premature delivery is increasing in Canada and is especially high in Alberta with 7.5% of pregnancies ending before 37 weeks gestation. Despite years of research into the causes of spontaneous preterm labor, few effective treatments have been identified. Progesterone is one candidate treatment. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether progesterone can prolong pregnancy in women who have symptoms of preterm labor.  Pregnant women who have symptoms of premature labor will be invited to take part in the study if they are between 22 to 24 weeks pregnant. If they agree to join the study, they will be randomly allocated to either take progesterone 200mg each day via the vagina until 36 weeks, or to take a placebo preparation. Neither the women nor their clinician will know which group they are in.  Women and their babies will be followed until 28 days after the birth, to find out about the length of the pregnancy, any adverse events that might occur (none have been reported in previous trials), and to look at whether women have taken the treatment.  When the study is complete, the results for the progesterone group will be compared to the placebo group. If progesterone is found to be useful in helping to prolong pregnancy, then this will be a possible treatment to help mothers in the future.

Inflammatory Effect Comparison Between Fentanyl and Remifentanil in Mastectomy Under General Anesthesia Mastectomy triggers stress and inflammation responses due to tissue trauma. Surgical stress will increase levels of hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, antidiuretic hormone, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrotic Factor-α, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, and interleukin-6) in the body. This causes insulin resistance, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, and impaired insulin secretion, which results in hyperglycemia due to intraoperative stress. Intraoperative hyperglycemia increases postoperative complications and mortality. Inhibition of hyperglycemia due to operative stress and stress hormones with good anesthetic management in improving patient outcomes.  The choice of opioid type plays an important role in suppressing the perioperative stress and inflammatory response. Opioids are an alternative, besides the use of regional anesthetic techniques which have been proven to suppress the perioperative stress response. Fentanyl is one of the phenylpiperidine synthetic opioids. Large doses of fentanyl can reduce stress responses but also increase side effects, such as hemodynamic instability and decrease T-cell function.  Remifentanil provides unique pharmacokinetic benefits through nonspecific esterase enzyme metabolism, so it has a very fast onset and half-life. In addition, remifentanil also provides benefits in reducing the production of interleukin 6 cytokines (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and inhibits neutrophil migration through the endothelial layer.  The stress response to stress and inflammation is directly proportional to the dose of remifentanil given. It is reported that remifentanil can suppress cortisol response according to increasing dose.  Winterhalter et al. and Lee et al. reported that remifentanil is better at suppressing the stress response than fentanyl. On the other hand, Bell et al. showed no difference in cortisol and hemodynamic levels between the two groups.  The goal of this study is to see if remifentanil provides less increase in serum epinephrine level, norepinephrine level, platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and blood glucose level at one-hour and 24-hours postoperative in patients undergoing mastectomy surgery under general anesthesia.
Cytotoxic T Cells to Prevent Virus Infections In this study, investigators are trying to see if infusion of "m-CTLs" will prevent or treat cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and adenovirus (AdV) reactivation or infection after cord blood transplant.  Patients with blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic disease may receive a cord blood transplant (UCBT) from an unrelated donor. After receiving a cord blood transplant, they are at risk of infections until a new immune system to fight infections grows from the cord blood cells. In this study, investigators are trying to give special cells from the cord blood called T cells. These cells will try to fight viruses that can cause infection.  Investigators will test to see if blood cells from donor that have been grown in a special way, can prevent patients from getting an infection. EBV, AdV and CMV are viruses that can cause serious life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems after transplant.  T lymphocytes can kill viral cells but normally there are not enough of them to kill all the virus infected cells after transplant. Some researcher have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person during a viral infection after a bone marrow transplant. Some of these studies have shown a positive therapeutic effect in patients receiving the CTLs (specially trained T cells) after a viral infection in the post-transplant period. In this study we are trying to prevent or treat viral infections by given the CTLs soon after getting the umbilical cord blood transplant.  With this study, investigators want to see if they can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells to prevent or treat AdV, EBV and CMV infection. Investigators will grow these T cells from the cord blood before transplant. These cells have been trained to attack adenovirus/EBV/CMV- infected cells and are called multivirus-specific cytotoxic (killer) T-cells or "m-CTL." Investigators would plan to give patients one dose of m-CTL any time from 30 to 364 days after your transplant. They have used T cells made in this way from the blood of donors to prevent infections in patients who are getting a bone marrow or blood stem cell transplant but this will be the first time investigators make them from cord blood.

Evaluation of the Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Gastric Botulinum Toxin Injection in the Treatment of Obesity. Background: Gastric injections of Botulinum toxin A (BTA) may induce changes in gastric emptying and body weight, but results vary. BTA dose and depth of injection may affect efficacy. This study assess changes in satiation, symptoms, and body weight after endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of 100 U BTA into gastric antral muscularis propria of obese subjects.  Methods: Open label study of twenty five healthy, obese adults (age=21-49 years, body mass index 35 = kg/m2) who received 100 U and were followed for 16 weeks. Measures included satiation (by maximum tolerated volume \[MTV\] during nutrient drink test), gastrointestinal symptoms (by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) and body weight.
Comparison of the Biolimus A9-eluting Stent With the Zotarolimus -Eluting Stent in Multi-vessel PCI The risk of restenosis in the treatment of coronary artery disease has significantly lessened thanks to the introduction of Drug eluting stent.  Yet, debates on the efficacy and safety of stents in complex lesions or patients have been circulated.  Recently, PCI in multiple lesions is universally performed with the development of effective stents in various kinds in the clinics.  However, a randomized study is rare for multi-vessel coronary artery disease in real procedural environments.  The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical progress of biolimus A9-eluting stent and zotarolimus-eluting stent in multi-vessel coronary artery disease.

The Use of Mobile Health Technology and Behavioral Economics to Encourage Adherence in Adolescents Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) affects over one million Americans and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by as much as 20-fold. Although the use of statins can substantially reduce this risk, adherence to statins in adults and adolescence is poor. In adults, lower rates of adherence are associated with an increased rate of CVD events and all-cause mortality, as well as an additional $44 billion annually in health care costs. Novel interventions are needed to improve medication adherence in patients with FH, starting in adolescents. An underused strategy to improve medication adherence incorporates the principles of behavioral economics. Traditional economic theory suggests that providing an incentive to perform a behavior will increase the frequency of that behavior. However, two prominent theories in behavioral economics, Present Bias and Loss Aversion, suggest that not all types of incentives are effective and that poorly structured incentives can actually be negative enforcers. With novel mobile health technologies (mHealth), interventions based on behavioral economics can now be studied on a larger scale. In this proposal, the investigators will test the use of monetary incentives ($30 per 30 days) to improve medication adherence in eligible subjects. The investigators will test the subject's adherence prior to the use of incentives (using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and the Wellth Mobile Application) and during the period of time the incentives are provided. Lastly, the investigators will test the subject's adherence (using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and Wellth App) during the 60 days following discontinuation of the incentives to determine if any effect of the incentive persists after the incentive is discontinued.
Diabetes Mellitus Community Based Screening in Minority Populations The purpose of the type II diabetes (T2D) screening study is to improve diabetes care in minority communities by identifying undiagnosed and uncontrolled T2D patients, as well as help patients without a regular primary care physician (PCP) find one within their community. These goals will be achieved first through a glucose measurement. Individuals with a high glucose measurement will be confirmed with a rapid hemoglobin A1c (HgA1c) test. The HgA1c test will tell us about the patients average blood sugar over the past 3 months, which will allow us to immediately diagnose new and uncontrolled type II diabetics. All participants will fill out a survey on healthcare seeking behaviors before glucose testing. All patients who enter the study will receive education on T2D and the value of regularly visiting their PCP, and will be provided a list of PCP currently accepting new patients within a 3 mile radius. Follow-up visits at 4 and 8 months will help us determine the success this community based screening.  The investigators hypothesis is that community based screening designed with adequate education and follow-up, and performed by qualified medical professionals will improve diabetes care in minority communities as assessed through hemoglobin A1c levels over 8 months, and in the change in the number patients who visit/obtain their PCP within the study period.
Study to Assess Enobosarm (GTx-024) in Postmenopausal Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence GTx-024 is an orally bioavailable and tissue-selective nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that has demonstrated androgenic and anabolic activity and is currently being evaluated as a potential treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in postmenopausal women. Urinary incontinence and pelvic floor disorders are major health problems for women, especially as they age. Pelvic floor muscle relaxation has been found to correlate with lower urinary tract symptoms including SUI. Muscles of the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract are crucial for supporting the pelvic organs and micturition; however, damage to the muscles or lack of hormonal stimulation are thought to contribute to pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence. Although anabolic steroids may increase muscle mass and strength, lack of oral bioavailability and known potential risks have limited their use. Nonsteroidal SARMs have potential to achieve benefits of anabolic steroid therapy (improved muscle mass, cholesterol/triglyceride levels, glucose metabolism, and bone density) with fewer adverse effects, such as hirsutism and acne, in women. Both nonclinical and clinical data suggest that SARMs may provide a new therapeutic option for pelvic floor and lower urinary tract disorders, as both testosterone and its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, have anabolic effects on muscle.
Intravenous Nitrite Infusion for Reversal of Cerebral Vasospasm After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage The hypothesis is that intravenous infusion of sodium nitrite is safe and effective for the reversal of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with a cerebral aneurysm.
Delivery Method and Risk for Urogenital Prolapse 15-20 Years Later The lifetime risk for a woman to undergo surgery for either vaginal prolapse or urinary incontinence is high. Previous studies have shown that pregnancy and childbirth are risk factors for developing prolapse. There is a lack of studies that follow women several years after delivery aiming to find whether symptoms of prolapse are linked to delivery method, ie vacuum, forceps, normal vaginal delivery and cesarean section. The investigators plan this study is to get more knowledge about pathology of prolapse and incontinence, to enable development of preventive strategies for these conditions.  Aim of the study is to determine whether the prevalence of symptoms and performed surgery for urogenital prolapse differs among women delivered by vacuum, forceps, normal vaginal delivery and cesarean section 15-20 years after their first delivery.  The investigators identify women that delivered their first child at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway between 1990-1997. Questionnaires will be sent to 2500 women (PFIQ-7, PFDI-20, PISQ-12), 600 of whom will get a clinical examination, where pelvic floor musculature is examined by palpation and 4D ultrasound, and a POP-Q quantification of prolapse performed.
ARomatherapy for Cognitive Trajectory in Chinese After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (ARCTIC-PCI) The ARCTIC-PCI (Aromatherapy for Cognitive Trajectory in Chinese after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled study to evaluated the effects of aromatherapy in improving cognitive function in post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients. The study will recruit 660 patients who undergo a PCI at the Department of Cardiology in Beijing Anzhen Hospital.  Baseline information will be collected prior to PCI, all eligible participants undergoing PCI will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio before hospital discharge to receive aromatherapy (70% menthol and 30% propanediol) or placebo (10% menthol and 90% propanediol). The treatment will last for 6 months in both groups. Cognitive function measurement will be conducted by blinded assessors at baseline (1-3 days before PCI) and at 3- and 6- month after PCI. The primary outcome will be the change in overall cognitive function (MOCA score) from baseline to 6-month after PCI.
Extension to a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Study of LCQ908 in Subjects With Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome.

Non Invasive Detection of Cardiac Allograft Rejection by Circulating microRNAs The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of expression of 4 circulating microRNAs in the serum using RT-PCR. A pilote study with cardiac transplant patients has shown that expression of these microRNAs could discriminate patients with a histologically proven rejection from patient displaying a normal endomyocardial biopsy. The signature must be confirmed in unselected patients and its stability evaluated according to clinical, biological and immunological parameters of included patients.
Tractography Guided Subcallosal Cingulate Deep Brain Stimulation for Treatment Resistant Depression Treatment resistant depression remains a major problem for individuals and society. Surgical procedures may provide relief for some of these patients. The most frequently considered surgical approach is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a part of the brain called the subcallosal cingulate region. However, the effectiveness and safety is not well established. The investigators will use a novel approach using advanced imaging technique (magnetic resonance tractography) to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this surgical approach. An innovative method for the definition of DBS target will be applied that redefines the concept of targeting as one of targeting a symptomatic network rather than a structural brain region using subject-based brain anatomy to define the target location. The correlation between imaging findings at baseline with the mood score changes at different time points of the study will be investigated.
Controlled Trial Of Acupuncture To Prevent Radiation-Induced Xerostomia The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if acupuncture can help to prevent xerostomia (dry mouth) and improve the quality of life in patients who receive radiation treatment to the head and neck. This study will determine if one acupuncture treatment approach is more effective than another. Dry mouth is a common problem among cancer patients who have received radiation treatment to the head and neck.
Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) J-BTC Phase 1 Study The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of oral dose of selumetinib in combination with chemotherapies (cisplatin and gemcitabine) in Japanese patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of selumetinib and chemotherapies will be investigated. Also, the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selumetinib in combination with chemotherapies for Japanese BTC patients will be identified, if possible.
Follow-up Home Visits With Nutrition To assess the effect on geriatric patients of follow-up home visit including nutrition.  The hypothesis is that this can prevent hospital readmissions, and has a positive impact on functional abilities and quality of life
The Effect of Micro-doses Erytropoietin on Exercise Capacity in Male and Females Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) regimen enhances maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), but the effect of micro-doses on maximal and submaximal performance is not clear and detection of micro-doses is difficult with current methods. This study investigated whether micro-doses of rHuEPO enhances maximal and endurance performance in males and females.
Enzalutamide With or Without Radium Ra 223 Dichloride in Patients With Metastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer This randomized phase II trial studies how well enzalutamide with or without radium Ra 223 dichloride in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that may slow down the growth of prostate cancer by blocking the action of the male hormone testosterone and other male hormones called androgens. Radiation therapy uses high energy alpha particles to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Enzalutamide with or without radium Ra 223 dichloride may work better in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
HCV Positive Heart Donors Study subjects active on the waiting list for a heart transplant at the NYU Langone Transplant Institute who are hepatitis C (HCV) negative will receive a heart transplant from a donor who tests positive for HCV. The study will entail surveillance for the development of HCV viremia post-transplant. Patients who develop HCV viremia post-transplant will be treated with an FDA-approved, pan-genotypic direct acting antiviral drug, Mavyret. Patients who are treated with Mavyret will be monitored for clearance of viremia and for sustained virologic response.
Extending Omalizumab Treatment Intervals in Patients With Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria This study is a multicentre, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial.  The purpose and aim of this study is to investigate if patients with well controlled (UCT score score ≥ 12) chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) on omalizumab 300 mg every four weeks can extend treatment intervals and maintain disease control.
Music-visual Guided Physical Activity Promotion for Adults With Intellectual Disabilities Objective: Although physical activity (PA) is cardiometabolic and psychologically beneficial to adults with intellectual disability (ID), its initiation and maintenance remain problematic. We examine the effects of a music-visual guided PA (MVgPA) intervention on the PA level, PA self-efficacy and interest as well as functional exercise capacity of adults with ID.  Hypothesis: Compared with usual care, MVgPA can significantly increase the participant's PA level and improve their PA self-efficacy and interest, and functional exercise capacity.  Design and participants: This cluster-randomized controlled trial will recruit 400 Chinese adults with mild to moderate ID from 20 residential care facilities.  Intervention: Based on the information-motivation-strategy model, MVgPA comprises a motivational and strategical preparatory session and ongoing support to residential service providers and a 12-week group-based staff-facilitated MVgPA (two 75-min session/week) for adults with ID. Outcome measurement PA level (primary outcome) will be measured by using an activity tracker. PA self-efficacy and interest will be measured by the Baseline Interview Questionnaire and visual analogue scale respectively. Functional exercise capacity will be measured by six-minute walk test. All outcomes will be measured at baseline, 13 and 25 weeks.  Data analysis: Intervention effects will be estimated using three-level mixed effects model.  Expected results: MVgPA will effectively enhance the PA levels of adults with ID. After intervention implementation, we expect that at least 50% of the residential care facilities allocated to the intervention group will demonstrate their willingness to continue to implement the MVgPA program (score 4 out of 6, 6 = most willing).

Autologous Platelet Concentrate (APC) in Intrabony Defects The aim of this 12-month clinical study is to treat patients affected by gum disease (periodontitis) by a minor gum surgery that aims to reduce the depth of the gum pockets. In particular, the study will compare two types of gum surgery, one based on the use of a product derived from the patients' own blood (PRGF, platelet autologous concentrate), and the other based on the use of an animal-derived bone graft and membrane that have been in the market for the past 30 years. Both procedures aim to regenerate bone and gum tissue that is damaged by the disease. 74, ≥ 25-year-old, otherwise healthy, patients affected by gum disease will be recruited at the Barts and The London Dental Hospital. Participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive one of the two treatments. Throughout the study, we will assess gum's health by taking some measurements around teeth and gums. In addition, we will use non-invasive technologies to assess changes in temperature, blood flow and face's swelling at different time-points. Patients will be given specific questionnaires to evaluate their preferences and the impact that each surgical treatment had in their everyday life. One intra-oral x-ray will be performed before the surgery and after 12 months to assess if new bone has formed around the teeth involved in the surgery, as per standard procedure.
Observational Study of Swallowing Function After Treatment of Advanced Laryngeal Cancer The purpose of this prospective, multi-institutional, observational cohort study is to determine if an initial surgical approach leads to better function and quality of life than primary chemoradiation in a subset of patients with advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers.
Combing a Deep Learning-Based Radiomics With Liquid Biopsy for Preoperative and Non-invasive Diagnosis of Glioma This registry has the following objectives. First, according to the guidance of 2021 WHO of CNS classification, we constructed and externally tested a multi-task DL model for simultaneous diagnosis of tumor segmentation, glioma classification and more extensive molecular subtype, including IDH mutation, ATRX deletion status, 1p19q co-deletion, TERT gene mutation status, etc. Second, based on the same ultimate purpose of liquid biopsy and radiomics, we innovatively put forward the concept and idea of combining radiomics and liquid biopsy technology to improve the diagnosis of glioma. And through our study, it will provide some clinical validation for this concept, hoping to supply some new ideas for subsequent research and supporting clinical decision-making.
Consequences and Correlates of Weight Fluctuations To quantify the association between multiple intentional weight losses (i.e., weight fluctuations) and the development of hypertension and diabetes mellitus among 50,790 female nurses participating in the ongoing Nurses' Health Study II. In addition to assessing the consequences of weight fluctuations, their correlates and course were identified.
Breath Gas Analysis for the Diagnosis of Breast Cancer The volatile content of the exhaled breath gas of mamma carcinoma patients will be chemically analyzed by proton-transfer-reaction time of flight mass spectrometry.  The goal of the study is to determine typical breath gas components that allow to distinguish patients with mamma carcinoma from women without carcinoma. Further, the investigators will test whether these breath gas markers can be used as tumor markers, which change in a typical manner during the progress of the disease. Finally the data will be investigated for the presence of marker components, that identify patients who will develop metastasis.
Intravitreal Bevacizumab vs Laser vs Combination of Bevacizumab and Modified Laser in PDR In this randomized 3-armed clinical trial, 105 eyes with PDR will be included and divided randomly into 3 groups: IVB group (35 eyes) that receive 4 monthly IVB injections and then rescue IVB, PRP group (35 eyes) that undergo full PRP in 2 or 3 sessions and then rescue IVB, and combination group (35 eyes) that receive 2 bimonthly IVB injections and a modified laser (1 session anterior to the equator) and then rescue IVB or laser. Diabetic macular edema (DME) will be treated independently in all groups by IVB. Primary outcome will be the number and activity of neovascularizations at 4,8 and 12 months and secondary measures will be changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT), and number of examinations and injection.
Preoperative Renal Insufficiency Predicts Postoperative Adverse Outcomes The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of postoperative mortality and complications in surgical populations with preoperative renal insufficiency.
Pregnancy, Childbirth Intentions and Outcomes Under Sexual Pain The main purpose of this study is to assess conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and pain experiences among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia. Specifically, this study aims to examine the following among women who have been diagnosed with vulvodynia: 1) rates of pregnancy/childbirth and desire for children; 2) fear of pregnancy and childbirth; 3) potential difficulties experienced while attempting to become pregnant and during pregnancy/childbirth; 4) methods used to become pregnant and deliver; 5) methods used to manage vulvodynia symptoms during pregnancy; and 6) pain outcomes associated with pregnancy.  Very little research has examined pregnancy/childbirth experiences among women with vulvodynia, or the natural history of vulvodynia. As such this is a preliminary investigation that will provide descriptive information regarding many of the proposed research questions. Based on the clinical experience of the investigators, it is expected that women with vulvodynia will report lower rates of pregnancy and higher levels of fear about pregnancy and childbirth in comparison to women without such pain. It is also expected that women with vulvodynia will report more difficulties becoming pregnant as compared to women without such pain, and that women with vulvodynia will report more elective nonvaginal births in comparison to vaginal births.
"Clinical Trials to Enhance Elders' Oral Health" ("TEETH") The purpose of this study is to determine if regular rinsing with chlorhexidine is effective as a long-term preventive method for reducing the incidence of tooth loss in low income older adults. The true end-point of the study is tooth loss after five years of regular rinsing with chlorhexidine or a placebo; surrogate endpoints are periodontal disease, root and coronal decay.
Effect of Encouragement on Six Minute Walk Test Performance Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterised by a build up of fatty plaque in the arteries in the lower limbs, resulting in a reduction of blow flow to the muscles. Globally, it is estimated that 236 million people are living with PAD. A classic symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC) which is characterised by muscle cramps in the lower limbs, typically brought on by exercise and relieved at rest. Exercise is recommended at first line treatment for IC. However to assess IC symptoms in response to an exercise study, maximal walking capacity (the furthest they can walk before it becomes too painful to walk) is typically the main measure. A patients walking capacity is assessed by a number of exercise testing protocols including the six-minute walk test (6MWT), where patients walk for six minutes with the aim to walk as far as they can in the time allotted. Patient encouragement has been shown to improve walking performance by as much as 30 meters in heart failure and respiratory disease populations. However the effect of encouragement on walking performance in people with IC is yet to be studied.
Brain Power Spectral Density Under Propofol In the operating room, the state of anesthesia is monitored during general anesthesia-induced hypnosis through EEG-based neuro-monitoring. Recent studies suggest that variables extracted from per-operative EEG change as brain ages. Furthermore, aging is itself an independant factor associated to an increased sensitivity to General Anesthesia (GA). Among fragility sign, per-operative Burst Suppression (BS) has been associated to a poor postoperative cognitive trajectory. The main goal of this observational clinical study is to extend the traditional use of per-operative EEG to the detection and prediction of various degrees of brain fragility, depending on the depth of anesthesia (DoA).
Contact: Developing New Clinical Management Strategies The goal of this study is to develop new methods of administering antidepressant medications that will result in improved drug/placebo separation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and enhanced medication response in open clinical treatment. The highly intensive, weekly visit schedule followed in most antidepressant RCTs radically differs from how antidepressant medications are prescribed in standard clinical practice and is believed to be a major reason why the majority of studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fail to show a significant difference between medication and placebo. Moreover, a "one size fits all" approach to psychopharmacologic management (i.e., weekly visits for all patients) does not take into account differences between patients that may predispose some individuals to respond positively to frequent follow-up visits, while others may respond negatively or not at all. Clinic visits comprise multiple components that may be therapeutic for depression, including activating patients' behavior, exposing them to medical procedures, permitting social interactions with research staff, and providing supportive meetings with clinicians. Two independent meta-analyses have associated more frequent study visits with increased antidepressant and placebo response as well as decreased separation between medication and placebo. Despite the high costs and potential disadvantages of weekly follow-up visits for patients receiving antidepressant medication, this clinical management strategy has not been studied prospectively to date. It is unknown whether weekly follow-up visits are needed to ensure treatment compliance and patient safety in clinical trials and to what degree contacts with clinicians influence medication and placebo response.
Microbiome, Exercise Tracking Study: Among Individuals at High Risk for Colorectal Cancer The purpose of this study has 2 aims:  Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining adults at high risk of colorectal cancer to a physical activity intervention trial. Investigators hypothesize that it will be possible to recruit and retain this patient population to a physical activity intervention trial.  Aim 2: To demonstrate the feasibility of collecting, processing, storing stool samples and analyzing the gut microbiome data. Investigators hypothesize that all of these steps are feasible.
The Effects of Dynamic Taping With Exercise on Neuromuscular Control in Individuals With Subacromial Impingement Background: Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is the commonest disorder of the shoulder, accounting for 44%-65% of all complaints of shoulder pain. Previous studies have found kinematic changes and alterations in muscle activation amplitude or timing. Recent studies also show the different organization of the corticospinal system in patients with SIS and alterations in central motor representation in individuals with rotator cuff tendinopathy. To restore kinematic changes and muscle activation in patients with SIS, treatments of patients with SIS commonly include motor control exercise and taping. However, there are different types of taping with different properties and purposes resulting in inconsistent outcomes. Recently, a new taping technique, Dynamic tape whose properties are between the most common taping Kinesio tape and rigid tape may solve the questions above. But the evidence of the effect of Dynamic tape and the additional effect of Dynamic tape with motor control exercises are still not well understood. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the additional effects of Dynamic taping with motor control exercise compared to motor control exercise alone on kinematic, muscle activity, corticospinal excitability, pain and function in people with subacromial Impingement Syndrome.  Methods: This is a randomized control trial. Fifty individuals with SIS will be randomly assigned into either an exercise group or dynamic tape with exercise group. Both groups will receive 5 sessions of treatment in 2 weeks, with 30 minutes per sessions. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, after the first intervention and following 2-week intervention. Primary outcome measures will include scapular kinematics, scapular muscle activation and corticospinal system. Secondary outcome measures included shoulder pain by a numeric pain rating scale and shoulder function by the disability of the arm, shoulder \& hand scale (DASH). Data analysis: two-way and three-way mixed ANOVA will used to compare the intervention effect of two groups.
A Phase I/II Study of Mitoxantrone Liposome Combined With Chidamide in Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a highly heterogeneous group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) originating from mature thymus T cells.Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection can accelerate the entry of mitoxantrone into cells, reduce the efflux of mitoxantrone, ensure the concentration of intracellular drugs, reverse the drug resistance mechanism, and enhance anti-tumor activity.We will explore the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection combined with Chidamide in the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination, and determine the phase II recommended dose RP2D.In the phase II study, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination regimen.
Assesment of TDApp1 an eHelath Tool to Make Therapeutic Recommendations for Patients With ADHD This is a 3-week open label, one group study to determine the agreement between the pharmacological treatment recommended by TDApp1 and the interventions recommended by relevant clinical practice guidelines.
Management of Childhood Obesity The significant increase in the prevalence of obesity can also be attributed to various social changes, in which the environment (political, economic, social, cultural), and not only the individual and his choices, takes a strategic place in the analysis of the problem and proposed interventions. The food environment can influence the choice and consumption of foods that promote obesity, such as ultra-processed foods (UPA). It is suggested that to intervene to effectively change behavior and eating habits, intensive interventions are needed that consider multiple levels that include the family, school, and community rather than one-off interventions that may not be effective in changing behavior and lifestyle. Regarding the family environment, parents or guardians can assist in the adoption of obesity-related behavioral patterns. It is known that the context of Primary Health Care (PHC) is ideal for actions to prevent diseases and promote children's health, since the PHC professional team is closest to the reality of life of the child, family, and community. We emphasize the importance of this study from the perspective of treatment of childhood obesity, in order to generate scientific evidence and practical subsidies for the implementation of interventions focused not only on the individual, but also in the context of the Unified Health System (SUS). The hypothesis of the study is that there will be a decrease in the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPA) among children, aged 6 to 10 years, living with obesity and who are treated in primary health care. In addition to encouraging healthy habits such as physical activity and the consumption of in natura and minimally processed foods. The management of childhood obesity is one of the priority topics on the national agenda of SUS's food, nutrition, and health promotion policies.
Balloon Sinuplasty Efficiency in Maxillary Rhinosinusitis. This study is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical study. The balloon sinuplasty treatment is compared to placebo effect in chronic or recurrent maxillary sinusitis. The purpose is to find out the efficacy of balloon sinuplasty of maxillary sinuses and the patients who get the best benefit from balloon sinuplasty. The investigators also want to find out if balloon sinuplasty of maxillary sinuses improves Eustachian tube dysfunction. The study is executed in the Department of Ear and Oral Diseases, Tampere University Hospital. 120 patients who have either recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis and whose sinusitis is limited mainly into maxillary sinuses, are recruited in the study. The patients are allocated either into the chronic maxillary sinusitis (60 patients) or the recurrent maxillary sinusitis (60 patients) branch of the study. Then, the patients are consecutively randomized into two treatment groups in the proportion of 1 to 1: A) Balloon sinuplasty group and B) Placebo group. The treatment is performed according to the patient's group status and all the patients are followed 12 months postoperatively.  The effect of balloon sinuplasty treatment in chronic maxillary rhinosinusitis is going to be measured primarily with the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). In recurrent acute maxillary rhinosinusitis, the effect of balloon sinuplasty treatment will be measured primarily with the number of acute rhinosinusitis infections. Besides this, number of antibiotic treatments and sick leaves are inquired, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) are used, rhinomanometry, Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT), tympanometry, tubomanometry, nasal endoscopy and general evaluation of the patients clinical ORL-status are performed. Also pre- and postoperative biopsies are taken from the middle turbinates.

Feasibility, Acceptability, and Usability of a Tele-rehabilitation Combining Immersive Virtual Reality Exercises and Therapeutic Education for Chronic Non-specific Neck Pain Background: Several randomized controlled trials have already investigated the efficacy of virtual reality treatment for chronic neck pain, however no study to date has investigated multimodal tele-rehabilitation, combining both specific neck exercises in immersive virtual reality and therapeutic education, in subjects with chronic non-specific neck pain.  Objectives: The primary objective of this mixed-methods pilot study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of tele-rehabilitation combining immersive virtual reality exercises and therapeutic education in people with chronic non-specific neck pain. Secondary objectives are: 1) to investigate changes in clinical outcomes (range of motion, pain intensity, neck disability, illness perceptions, kinesiophobia, impression of change) ; 2) to explore the subjects' experience of tele-rehabilitation.  Methods: The duration of the intervention will be 6 weeks, including 5 virtual reality sessions (15-20 minutes per session, without supervision of the physiotherapist) and 1 teleconsultation session with a physiotherapist (30 minutes per session) per week. Participants will be assessed quantitatively before and after the intervention, and qualitatively after the intervention.  Discussion: Study findings will provide evidence concerning the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of multimodal tele-rehabilitation for chronic non-specific neck pain, using immersive virtual reality. This study may strengthen the scientific evidence for the use of immersive virtual reality at home in the treatment of chronic non-specific neck pain.
A Study of the Effect of Tocilizumab on Markers of Atherogenic Risk in Patients With Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis This 2 arm study will investigate the effects of tocilizumab on lipids, arterial stiffness, and markers of atherogenic risk in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. In Part 1 of the study, patients will be randomized to receive either tocilizumab 8mg/kg intravenously or placebo every 4 weeks, in combination with methotrexate 7.5-25 mg weekly. In Part 2, all patients will receive open-label treatment with tocilizumab plus methotrexate.
The Effect of Intra Oral Cryotherapy in Patients With Symptomatic Apical Periodontitis The participants were divided into two groups: Group I (cryotherapy) (n =10) after the completion of the mechanical preparation intra oral cryotherapy was applied. Group II (control) (n =10) received standard root canal treatment without the application of any type of cryotherapy.
Radiotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinomas After Hepatectomy With Narrow Margin (<1 cm) or Portal Vein Thrombosis Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of ten leading cancer types worldwide and also in Asia, but the five-year relative survival rate is relatively quite low1-3. As a common complication of HCC, portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) have been reported with an occurrence of 34% \~ 50% in advanced HCC and it is now become an extremely pressing problem for hepatic surgeon. Nevertheless, the patients overall survival (OS) varies on their clinical features or liver function4. For HCC PVTT treatment, current options are surgical resection, embolization chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a variety of ablation therapy, biological and gene therapy,etc. Among them, the use of radiation therapy is getting more and more attention, and it is changing from the past palliative treatment to current curable treatment. From an oncologic point of view, a narrow margin \<1 cm is not safe and is often associated with higher rates of recurrence and shorter patient survival.On the other hand, it is also believed that most intrahepatic recurrences arise from multicentric carcinogenesis and are distant from the resection margin.To address this issue, the investigators are going to conduct a series of retrospective and prospective studies to investigate the effect of adjuvant RT for centrally located HCC after narrow margin (\<1 cm) hepatectomy on tumor recurrence.

GastroBot: Artificial Intelligence Applied to Bowel Preparation It is estimated that about 20% of colonoscopies have inadequate preparation. (5) This is associated with lengthy procedures and less detection of adenomas, reduces the screening intervals, and increases the costs and risks of complications. Several strategies have been proposed to improve the quality of bowel preparation. Mobile healthcare Apps have been developed to increase adherence to bowel preparation agents, improving the quality of bowel preparation. However, adherence to mobile healthcare Apps is also a quality criterion and a pending problem to solve with this new technology.  GastroBot is a new technology based on artificial intelligence that allows, through a software bot, to carry out a personalized follow-up of the patient's bowel cleansing, advising the patient to overcome contingencies that arise with the preparation, which in other circumstances could lead to the failure of it. The primary aim of this study is to determine the improvement in bowel preparation after GastroBot assistance compared with the traditional explanation. As a secondary aim, this study also pursues to determine adenoma and polyp detection rates (ADR and PDR, respectively), bowel preparation agents' tolerance, and GastroBot functionality.
Lung Water by Ultrasound Guided Treatment in Hemodialysis Patients (The Lust Study). Volume overload is a leading risk factor for death and cardiovascular events in end stage renal disease patients maintained on chronic dialysis, particularly in those with myocardial ischemia and heart failure which represent a substantial fraction of this population. Early identification of volume overload may prevent cardiovascular sequel in these patients but clinical signs of volume expansion are unsatisfactory to reliably identify patients at risk and to monitor them over time. On the other hand, however reliable, standard techniques for measuring extracellular or circulating (blood) volume do not convey information on fundamental heart function parameters that determine the individual haemodynamic tolerance to volume excess and the response to ultrafiltration, i.e. left ventricular (LV) filling pressure and LV function.  Extra-vascular lung water is critically dependent on these parameters and represents a proxy of both, circulating volume and LV filling pressure and function, and may therefore be a better criterion to identify patients at a higher risk of volume-dependent adverse clinical outcomes and to monitor the effect of therapy aimed at preventing these outcomes. A fast (\< 5 min.), easy to learn, simple and non-expensive technique which measures extra-vascular lung water by using standard ultrasound (US) machines has been validated in dialysis patients. Whether systematic measurement of lung water by this technique may translate into better clinical outcomes in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients has never been tested.  The aim of this randomized clinical trial is that of testing a treatment policy guided by extra-vascular lung water measurements by ultrasound to prevent all-cause death, decompensated heart failure and non-fatal myocardial infarction in high risk dialysis patients with myocardial ischemia (a history of myocardial infarction with or without ST elevation or unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome documented by ECG recordings and cardiac troponins or stable angina pectoris with documented coronary artery disease by prior coronary angiography or ECG) or overt heart failure (NYHA class III-IV).

Nurturing and Quiet Intervention: NeuroN-QI The current state of knowledge reveals that the development of the brain of preterm infants is influenced by specific neonatal experiences during hospitalization, such as environmental sensory stimulation (light and noise), as well as physical and emotional proximity to mothers. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the benefits that could be associated with the combination of care interventions to improve the health outcomes of preterm infants and their mothers, and in particular the development of the brain of infants during their hospitalization in the neonatal unit. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a developmental care intervention including periods of nurturing between mothers and their infant (skin-to-skin contact and auditory stimulation) to promote physical and emotional proximity and a quiet period (controlled light and noise levels and olfactory stimulation in incubators) and to estimate the effect of this intervention on infants' neurodevelopment as well as on maternal stress and anxiety.

Off-therapy Response After Stopping Entecavir or Tenofovir Pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN) α-2a, entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are current recommended first-line antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Compared with Peg-IFN therapy, nucleot(s)ide analogue (NUC) therapy has the advantages of having a potent antiviral effect, and good tolerance without side effect. The long-term safety and efficacy of ETV and TDF therapy had also been identified. However, poor durability of the effectiveness after stopping NUC therapy are encountered in the majority of patients. Previous study identified a high HBV relapse rate of over 50% in HBeAg- positive CHB patients treated with lamivudine. A recent study investigating the post-treatment durability of ETV showed that higher to 45.3% of the HBeAg-negative CHB patients happened a clinical relapse within 1-year after stopping ETV therapy. TDF is another recommended first line NUC with high potency and high genetic barrier. Although the efficacy of long-term TDF therapy had been identified, there is lack of data regarding the off-therapy response in CHB patients with TDF therapy currently. Only a small scale of patients treated with TDF were included in a recent study investigating off-therapy relapse in non-cirrhotic HBeAg-negative CHB patients after greater than 4 years of NUC therapy. In addition, the factors associated with off-therapy response are also still uncertain.  The investigators plan to enrolled 400 CHB patients who had received oral antiviral therapy ETV or TDF and achieved the Asia Pacific association of the study of liver (APASL) criteria of stopping NUC therapy. The aims of the study are to investigate the rate of HBV relapse including virological and clinical relapse in all and between patients with ETV and TDF therapy, and to identify the predictive factors of relapse.

CISCO-21 Prevent and Treat Long COVID-19. Many people have long-lasting symptoms after COVID-19, such as breathlessness, fatigue and chest pain. So far, research studies of treatments for COVID-19 have focused on the life-threatening acute illness; few studies look at treatments to improve long-term health after COVID-19. COVID-19, particularly when this requires a hospital admission, can lead to weight loss and muscle wasting, contributing to worse outcomes. Muscle strengthening (resistance-based) exercise could improve outcomes in the long-term.
Hepatic Fibrosis Non-invasive Methods Questionnaire Due to the limitations and the invasive nature of liver biopsy, there has been extensive interest in developing non-invasive tests to measure liver fibrosis (1). These are alternatives to liver biopsy that can be used in clinical practice, with benefits in terms of cost, risk, and patient convenience (2). Clinically applicable non-invasive tests include radiological studies, transient elastography (TE), and serum markers. We aim at studying acceptability, reliability, applicability and practical aspects of invasive and noninvasive methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis among hepatologists.

Delayed CNI-based Immunosuppression With Advagraf After MELD-based Liver Transplantation Prolonged-release low-dose Advagraf should better protect from CNI-side effects compared to standard immunosuppressive regiments while the rate of rejection is not increased and thus graft function is well maintained. We hypothesize that especially in high-MELD (MELD-score \>20) recipients who have a decreased immune competence the prolonged-release low-dose Advagraf concept would better protect from side effects of immunosuppression (i.e. infection). Nevertheless, we assume that also patients with a MELD-score ≤20 will benefit from this concept in regard to lower infection rates and less side effects of immunosuppression.

Research and Analysis of the Mechanisms Involved in the Emergence of Breast Cancer Stem Cells (RepriM) From a cellular perspective, breast cancers appear to develop hierarchically from a small contingent of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The presence of CSCs in tumor tissue is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis, as well as a worse prognosis. Thus, these CSCs exhibit resistance to conventional anti-tumor treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Moreover, these treatments would favor the emergence of these CSCs and the reprogramming of non-CSCs in CSCs. It has been demonstrated in neoadjuvant that the proportion of CSCs before any treatment is correlated with chemoresistance and that a resurgence of CSCs after chemotherapy is correlated with a poor prognosis. However, the mechanisms involved in the emergence of CSCs by reprogramming of non-CSCs are not yet known.  The Oscar Lambret Center proposes a monocentric prospective interventional study based on the cellular and molecular analysis of the tumor, serum and circulating cells, before, during and at the end of the treatment for each patient receiving a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. The identification of the mechanisms contributing to the enrichment of CSCs resistant to chemotherapy could lead to therapeutic solutions.
The Effect of Remote Ischemic Conditioning in Patients With Hypercholesterolemia There is an on-going discussion weather remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is effective in limiting the damage of reperfusion injury in STEMI patients. The results from recent RCTs have been variable and most have not shown convincing positive results when analyzing hard endpoints. Hence, there is a great need to evaluate the impact of comorbidities on the effectiveness of RIC. Therefore, we have designed a study to evaluate the impact of hypercholesterolemia on the RIC response by evaluating ischemia-induced endothelial dysfunction.  Aim: To investigate the impact of hypercholesterolemia on the RIC response in counteracting ischemia-induced endothelial dysfunction.

Uganda has been severely affected by HIV infection and AIDS and has been selected to participate in HIV-vaccine development. The HIV viruses commonly isolated from Uganda are 2 kinds that are not used in making current vaccines. Current vaccines generate several kinds of immune responses. Researchers would like to see if a response to the kind of virus in a current vaccine will also protect people from the viruses commonly found in Uganda.
LINK: Aftercare Monitoring Project The prevalence of substance use disorders (SUD) in the VA is rising, making SUD(s) among the most commonly diagnosed disorders in the VA. A substantial body of data attests to the effectiveness of substance use disorder treatment; further the predictor most consistently associated with positive addiction treatment outcomes is duration. Despite the body of evidence supporting length of treatment as one of the stronger predictors of long-term SUD outcomes, only 36% of SUD treatment programs in the VA are meeting the continuing care performance criterion specified by the Office of Quality Performance. This randomized clinical trial investigates whether substance use disorder patients assigned to telephone case monitoring (TCM) for continuing care will do better than those attending face-to-face continuing care as usual (CCAU)(standard outpatient care).

Treatment of Acute Pyelonephritis With Gram Negative Strains in Infants and Children Less Than 3 Years Old The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of the therapeutic efficacy of cefixime by mouth (PO) 10 days (d) and ceftriaxone intravenous route(IV) 4d followed by cefixime PO 6d on renal scars 6 months after a first acute pyelonephritis episode.  The investigators hypothesize that treatment with cefixime PO will allow no more renal scars than intravenous route (IV) treatment of pyelonephritis in infants and children less than 3 years old, 6 months after the first episode. If it is true, treatment will no longer need hospitalisation and the advantages for children, families and the health system will be very important.
Evaluating the Efficacy of CPAP Therapy for the Treatment of Fatty Liver We are doing this research study to evaluate whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a treatment for sleep apnea, will also help treat fatty liver disease. Sleep apnea is a disease where a person has interruptions in their breathing while they are sleep. This can lead to low oxygen levels in the blood. CPAP is a mask that delivers oxygen at high pressure to the lungs to prevent a decrease in blood oxygen levels. CPAP is a known treatment for sleep apnea.

Effects of Pilates in Patients With Post- -COVID-19 Syndrome: Controlled and Randomized Clinical Trial The COVID-19 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with direct and indirect effects on several systems, especially the musculoskeletal system, in addition to the respiratory system. Some of these symptoms persist for a long time, called Post-COVID-19 Syndrome, directly interfering with the functional capacity and quality of life of these patients. Pilates exercises focus on breathing, postural symmetry, trunk stabilization, flexibility, joint mobility and strengthening through the full range of motion of all joints and not isolated muscle groups. The objective of this study will be to evaluate the clinical and functional effects of a Pilates for patients post hospitalization for COVID-19. A randomized and controlled clinical trial will be conducted, with recruitment patients who have developed the severe form of COVID-19 and required at least 7 days of invasive mechanical ventilation. They will be previously randomized in a 1:1 ratio by electronic system and blindly allocated to the intervention group that will perform an exercise protocol based on the Pilates method, 2x/week, for 12 weeks in therapeutic sessions of identical protocols lasting 60 min. All patients will be evaluated before and after for six minutes walk distance test, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength and endurance, post-COVID-19 functional status, dyspnea, and quality of life. The analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principles. Descriptive statistics will be used to present the characteristics of participants in the two treatment groups. P values less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical evidence of significance. The variables of dyspnea, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, functional capacity, post-COVID functional status and HRQoL will be analyzed using linear models of repeated measures which included all values measured after randomization with baseline scores and treatment clusters as covariates. Adjusted mean differences will be tested 12 weeks after randomization and start of intervention. Multiple comparisons will be performed using the Tukey Test with p-values adjusted using the Holm procedure. Baseline variables will be evaluated as predictors and moderators of treatment effects, including terms and interaction models. Effect sizes for primary and secondary endpoints will be calculated as Cohen's d from estimated marginal means (SMD) and standard error estimates from the adjusted primary analysis. All analyzes were performed using RStudio version 0.99.486. Results: The expected results are based on the alternative hypothesis that Pilates exercises are clinically effective, improving functional performance, exercise tolerance, reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of patients with symptoms of Post-COVID-19 Syndrome.
Endothelin Receptor Antagonism in Proteinuric Nephropathy The number of people with kidney problems is increasing rapidly, related in part to the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Patients with kidney problems tend to have protein leaking into the urine (proteinuria). Both proteinuria and the kidney disease itself are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Reducing proteinuria is an important treatment goal in people with kidney problems. Endothelin is a chemical produced both by blood vessels and the kidney. Higher than normal levels of endothelin are thought to contribute to progression of kidney disease and proteinuria. By using drugs that block the effects of endothelin ('endothelin receptor antagonists') we can hopefully reduce both of these. The purpose of the study is to ascertain whether endothelin receptor antagonists improve kidney function and reduce proteinuria more so than other commonly used drugs.
Second Curettage in Treating Patients With Persistent Non-metastatic Gestational Trophoblastic Tumors This phase II trial studies how well a second curettage (removal of the abnormal cancer cells in the uterus using a method of surgically removing the lining of the uterus) works in treating patients with gestational trophoblastic tumors that did not go away after a first curettage (persistent) and has not yet spread to other places in the body (non-metastatic). A second curettage may be effective in treating persistent gestational trophoblastic tumors and may decrease the likelihood that patients will need chemotherapy in the near future.
Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Epicardial Adipose Tissue and on Myocardial Function Growing evidence suggests that bariatric surgery is a relevant treatment for severely obese patients, especially those with metabolic complications, as it significantly reduces weight, hypertension and ameliorates glycemic control. Its action on adipose tissue distribution and in particular on epicardial adipose tissue EAT remains unknown. Whether metabolic improvement is associated with EAT reduction is also unknown.  The researchers thus investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on EAT in severely obese patients. The primary endpoint of this study was the change in EAT amount 6 months after bariatric surgery.

Effectiveness of Fast-track Clinical Pathway on Minimally-invasive Total Hip Arthroplasty Surgery in NTUH The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway incorporated with pre-operative physical therapy and education on immediate and short-term outcomes of minimally-invasive surgery of total hip arthroplasty (MIS-THA). We hypothesized that this ERAS pathway can shorten post-operative length of hospital stay and ensure same-day independent mobilization in MIS-THA. The first specific aim was to compare primary immediate outcomes, including post-operative length of hospital stay and the rate of same-day independent mobilization, between ERAS for MIS-THA patients and conventional MIS-THA patients. The second aim was to compare other immediate outcomes, including post-operative pain scores, analgesics usage, the rate of blood transfusion and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), between the two groups of patients. Third, we aimed to compare short-term outcomes, including post-operative 1-year Harris hip score, Oxford hip score and EQ-5D index of quality of life, between the two groups of patients. We also compared hospital cost and profit between the two groups of patients. Moreover, we identified the factors affecting post-operative length of hospital stay in ERAS for MIS-THA patients.

Lenalidomide, Vorinostat and Dexamethasone in Relapsed Patients With Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (PTCL) A standard therapy is neither established in first-line patients nor in relapsed patients with PTCL, and there is still an unmet medical need to identify novel efficacious and safe therapy regimens.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a Lenalidomide plus Vorinostat and Dexamethasone combination therapy as an effective and safe therapeutic regimen, in the treatment of relapsed PTCL following failure of prior regimens.
Vestibular Implants Tested in Human Subjects The goal of this study is to improve the vestibular implant's ability to reduce the vestibular-dependent perceptual, postural, and visual symptoms that affect patients with severe peripheral vestibular damage. The long-term research plan is focused on exploring the three questions which must be answered to assess the clinical utility of a vestibular implant (VI) in vestibulopathic patients - i) how can information transfer from the VI sensors to the brain be optimized; ii) how does the three-dimensional angular velocity information provided by the VI interact in the brain with other sensorimotor (vision, otolith, efferent) signals; and iii) how effectively does the VI alleviate the behavioral deficits and subjective symptoms experienced by patients with severe vestibular damage. The current study will be used to focus on two key subsets of these questions. Over one year, the investigators will study approximately 5 patients who have severe bilateral vestibular damage and functioning VI's, which will focus on aim 1: how the angular velocity information sensed by the VI can be optimally transferred to the brain; and aim 2: how effectively the VI improves the clinical status of vestibulopathic patients when they receive acute and sub-acute (3 days) motion-modulated stimulation. In sum, the investigators aim to improve the efficacy of the VI in human subjects by developing new knowledge about how the brain processes motion cues provided by the VI and correlating this information with behavioral outcomes.

Development of a Response Signature to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women. It is often treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, administered before surgical resection. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond to this treatment, or only respond partially. Clinicians therefore need predictive biomarkers of treatment response. Thanks to an innovative technique, called CATS, this study aims at identifying blood and tissue biomarkers which are predictive of response to chemotherapy.
Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Versus Phonophoresis in Sub Acromial Impingement Syndrome. shoulder sub acromial impingement syndrome is an encroachment of subacrormial tissues, rotator cuff, subacrormial bursa, and the long head of the biceps tendon, as a result of narrowing of the subacrormial space. Activities requiring repetitive or sustained use of the arms over head often predispose the rotator cuff tendon to injury. Hence the objective of the study is to examine the influence of extra corporeal Shock wave versus phonophoresis on pain severity and functional disability in patients with sub acromial impingement syndrome.

Using CHWs and HPV Home Tests to Increase Cervical Cancer Screening in Minority Populations Caribbean immigrants (both Hispanics and Blacks from Haiti) are less likely to be screened for cervical cancer than the general population. One promising approach is outreach strategies that employ Community Health Workers (CHWs). Yet even in well structured CHW programs, many women remain unscreened. In our NCI Community Networks sponsored project, we are testing an approach that combines CHWs with self sampling for the human papilloma virus (HPV) as a screening strategy among such hard to reach populations.
Impact of the Addition of a Specific and Personalized Body Approach by Osteopathic Treatment in the Care of Adolescents With Anorexia Nervosa. Abstract:  Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a common pathology affecting mainly women (sex ratio 1/10), which starts most often during adolescence. The prognosis of the AN remains poor (10% of deaths and high risk of chronicity). Body dissatisfaction, disturbances in recognition and identification of body sensations are some of the key symptoms of AN. There is, however, a contrast between this consensual observation of the importance of troubles in body image in AN, and the relative deficit of specifically targeted body treatments. Our proposal for a body approach specifically dedicated to AN is based on the understanding that posture, breathing, muscle tension and body perception are closely linked to our psychological and emotional state, and are therefore disturbed in patients with AN.  The purpose of this monocentric randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if a targeted osteopathic protocol treatment for AN in addition to as-usual care is significantly more effective compared to as-usual care.  Methods: Seventy-two female patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups : one receiving the specific osteopathic treatment targeted for AN in addition to the as-usual care (group A) and the other one, the as-usual care (group B). The patients of group A will receive 5 sessions of osteopathic treatment for 25 minutes. Soft specific palpatory techniques on the diaphragm, digestive system and cervical region will be realized. The as-usual care is defined by the multidisciplinary approach recommended by the high authority of health. The primary outcome is the evaluation of interoceptive sensibility and secondary outcomes include clinical and psychopathology-related symptoms and assessment of somatic dysfonctions' evolution. A qualitative study will also be carried out, applying the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis method. Patients will be included for a maximum of 14 weeks between the inclusion time and the last evaluation.  Discussion:  If the results of the study are positive (statistically significant effectiveness of this body approach in addition to as-usual care compared to as-usual treatment), patients with anorexia will be benefit from the possibility of additional treatment that is effective, relatively inexpensive, non-invasive and non-pharmacological.

Expedited Partner Therapy and the HIV Prevention Cascade The HIV epidemic in Peru remains concentrated in the subpopulation of men who have sex with men (MSM), where the prevalence of disease has been estimated between 10-22% in recent epidemiologic surveys. Partner-based methods to limit the spread of HIV and STI co-infection, including partner notification and partner treatment, provide an important new strategy for HIV control in the region.  Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) has been shown to reduce rates of persistent or recurrent gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in heterosexual patients, but has not been fully evaluated for use among men who have sex with men (MSM). CDC guidelines support the use of EPT for partner management with heterosexual patients, but note the absence of evidence necessary to make an equivalent recommendation for the use of EPT with MSM. Randomized clinical trials to assess the impact of EPT on partner notification, treatment, and STI re-infection among MSM are critical to the development of evidence-based partner management guidelines.  As a theoretical model, EPT integrates behavioral, social, and biomedical approaches to HIV/STI control in a comprehensive prevention intervention. Our proposed exploration of the social and behavioral dimensions of partner notification and treatment will provide a methodological structure for understanding the influence of EPT on behavioral decision-making processes, interpersonal factors that influence partner notification, and network patterns of STI transmission within MSM populations in Peru.  The proposed study includes a screening protocol to identify eligible MSM subjects for participation in our planned study of the effect of EPT on partner notification, treatment, and linkage to HIV prevention and care services. Potential participants will complete a behavioral survey and undergo physical examination and testing for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Participants diagnosed with Gonorrhea and/or Chlamydia (at any anatomic site) will be eligible for enrollment in our Partner Management study of EPT and the HIV prevention cascade among MSM in Peru.  Participants in the Partner Management study will be randomly assigned to receive either standard of care partner notification counseling or standard counseling along with a maximum of five antibiotic treatment packets to deliver to their recent sexual partners. Participants will be asked to return to the site after 21 days to report on their actual partner notification behavior, with differences in notification evaluated between the two groups. Participants will then work with a study counselor to identify their recent partners and, if the participant agrees, to provide contact information so that the study team can contact these partners. Study staff will either confirm that the partner has already been notified, or provide notification of their likely STI exposure. After informing partners of their STI exposure, staff will ask partners to provide verbal consent to a single question evaluation (whether or not the partner had previously been informed of their exposure) to verify participant-reported behavior. Partners will also be asked to visit the study site to complete a brief survey of their sexual practices and treatment-seeking behavior, as well as to undergo testing for HIV and STIs. All of the above data will be used to construct models of the spread of HIV and STIs in local MSM networks, and the potential effect of EPT on controlling the spread of STIs in this population.
Early Cycle Ergometry for Critically-Ill Liver Failure Patients in a Transplant Intensive Care Unit Critically-ill patients with liver disease are at high risk of developing sarcopenia and intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness, which are associated with mortality and other poor outcomes. Early physical rehabilitation has shown benefit in ICU settings, but has not been studied in ICU patients with acute and chronic liver failure. Cycle ergometry, or stationary cycling in passive and active modes, may be especially beneficial to such patients due to their high prevalence of severe physical deconditioning and variable mentation. The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility, safety, and benefit of cycle ergometry over standard physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT) in critically-ill patients who have acute or chronic liver disease.
Dynamic Preload Dependence Indices in Laparoscopic Surgery A goal-directed fluid management is definitely beneficial in high risk surgery. The fluid administration can be directed by cardiac output monitoring which evaluate the response to repeated fluid challenge or by preload dependence indices. These indices are not well validated in laparoscopic surgery while pneumoperitoneum can alter venous return or pulmonary compliance.  The aim of the study is to study the validity of pulse pressure variation to predict fluid response under laparoscopic conditions and to describe the effect of the pneumoperitoneum on the dynamic preload indicators, i.e. the pulse pressure variation, the plethysmographic waveform of pulse oximetry variation and the stroke volume variation.

MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T for Advanced NSCLC This first time in human study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A\*02:01 and/or HLA-A\*02:06 and a tumor test positive for MAGE A10 protein expression (protein or gene). This trial is a dose escalation trial that will evaluate 3 doses of transduced cells administered after a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen using a 3+3 dose escalation design .The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer cells.  When the MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the T cell infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.  Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells back and up to first 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every three months. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years, then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years. Subjects who have a confirmed response or clinical benefit ≥4 weeks after the first T-cell infusion and whose tumor continues to express the appropriate antigen target may be eligible for a second infusion. All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the Interventional Phase of the study, will enter a 15-year long-term follow-up phase for observation of delayed adverse events. All subjects will continue to be followed for overall survival during the long-term follow-up phase.

Central Nervous System Uptake of Anti-CD8+ T Cell Minibodies in Multiple Sclerosis and Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Background:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Both diseases can cause muscle weakness and impair vision, speech, and coordination. Researchers are working to better understand how MS and PML affect the CNS.  Objective: To test whether an experimental radioactive tracer (minibody) can help positron emission tomography (PET) scans detect certain immune cells in the CNS of people with MS and PML.  Eligibility:  People aged 18 years and older with MS or PML.  Design:  Participants will come to the clinic for at least 3 visits over 4 to 6 weeks.  Participants will undergo testing. They will have a physical and neurological exam. They will have blood tests and tests of their heart function. They will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. They may have a spinal tap: Their lower back will be numbed, and a needle will be inserted between the bones of the spine to withdraw fluid from around the spinal cord.  Minibody is given through a tube with a needle placed in a vein in the arm. This takes 5 to 10 minutes. Participants will have heart function tests before and after receiving the minibody.  Participants will return the next day for the PET scan. They will lie on a table that moves through a doughnut-shaped machine. This scan will take about 1 hour.  Participants with PML may opt to repeat the minibody infusion and the PET scan within 6 months.

The Effects of the Water-exchanged Colonoscopy on Adenoma Detection Rate Water exchange method has been shown to reduce medication requirement and pain experienced during colonoscopy. It may increase the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Water exchange provides salvage cleansing and the refractive index of water (n equals about 1.3) is larger than that of air, which creates optical distortion that likely contributes to objects appearing larger underwater, making smaller lesions easier to visualize and it may help draw attention to those smaller lesions during withdraw. These principles facilitate to the higher adenoma detection rate.  There is a large number of literature on the adenoma detection rate during water exchange colonoscopy, but most studies have been conducted in only one centre, simple-size, and under sedation patients, the influence of adenoma detection rate under unsedation patients was unclear.  The aim of this study is to compare the ADR of colonoscopy by using the water exchange method versus the conventional air method in unsedation patients in multiple centers in China.

Hybrid Argon Plasma Coagulation and Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty Validation Study The purpose of this research is to evaluate the clinical safety, durability, and weight loss outcomes of the hybrid argon plasma coagulation + endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (HAPC-ESG) procedure when compared to traditional endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) alone. ESG was proven to be feasible in human subjects in 2013 and since then has become the most commonly performed endoscopic bariatric remodeling procedure. However, this procedure may be enhanced with the addition of the hybrid argon plasma coagulation (HAPC) technique, leading to enhanced weight loss, durability, and metabolic benefits. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a method of non-contact thermal hemostasis initially created to assist in inducing hemostasis utilizing a high-frequency current to the targeted area. This is a validation study of a pilot randomized control trial which will evaluate the safety, durability, and effects on weight loss of the combined HAPC-ESG approach when compared to traditional ESG alone.
Immunophenotyping and Xist Gene in AML Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by clonal expansion of myeloid progenitors (blasts) in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.Several studies have reported correlations of aberrantly expressed markers by flowcytometry with clinical outcome in AML. X-inactive specific transcript RNA was one of the first long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to be discovered in the early 1990s. Xist RNA is the master regulator of XCI, the epigenetic process that equalizes the dosage of X-linked genes between female (XX) and male (XY) mammals. Yildirim et al., (2013) deleted Xist in the blood compartment of mice and demonstrated that mutant females developed a highly aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic syndrome (mixed MPN/MDS) with 100% penetrance.  Their study implies that human hematologic cancers may result from overdosage of X, either from Xist loss on Xi or from duplication of Xa. And they proposed that carcinogenesis is driven by a series of changes occurring in the HSC and further accumulated in mature hematopoietic cells. These changes are initiated by loss of Xist, which leads to progressive X reactivation, which in turn induces a cascade of unfavorable genome-wide changes that include dysregulation of genes involved in DNA replication, chromosome segregation, cell-cycle checkpoints, and hematopoiesis. A failure of HSC maturation and loss of long-term HSC in the marrow progressively shift hematopoiesis to extramedullary sites resulting in extra medullary hematopoiesis (EMH), thereby causally linking the X chromosome to cancer in mice. Thus, they concluded that Xist RNA not only is required to maintain XCI but also suppresses cancer in vivo.  Indeed, the emerging role of aberrant gene dosage in diseases, whether of the X chromosome or for autosomes, brings with it the possible application of drugs that impact on epigenetic regulators in potential therapeutic strategies.  To date, there are no published studies on human about Xist gene and its relationship with the immunophenotyping in AML patients. So, this will be the first study designed to explain its unexplored pathway in AML and detect its prognostic role and immunophenotypic association.
SIGNATURE Study : DCB (Legflow) vs POBA in Fempop Arteries The aim of this study is to demonstrate the superiority in safety and efficacy of the Legflow DCB vs standard uncoated POBA in a randomized controlled (RCT) for treatment of patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to stenosis, restenosis or occlusion of the femoral and/or popliteal arteries.
Study on the Establishment of a System for Early Warning and Prognostic Evaluation of Patients With Sepsis Sepsis is a clinical syndrome with high morbidity and high fatality rate in emergency department. Patients with acute liver or kidney injury are more likely to develop Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome(MODS) secondary to the non-hepatic injury group, and the prognosis deteriorates significantly. At present, there is no unified diagnostic criteria for acute liver injury associated with sepsis, and the commonly used prognostic evaluation system is rarely included in liver injury indicators, which is not good for practicality.
Stepped Palliative Care Versus Early Integrated Palliative Care in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer This research study is evaluating ways to provide palliative care to patients who have recently been diagnosed with lung cancer
Neonatal, Infant and Toddler Salivary Study (NITS Study) Currently, the only way to analyse glucocorticoids for the screening or diagnosis of AI in young children is via plasma obtained by invasive capillary or venous blood sampling. Thus, there is an unmet need for a safe and simple salivary collection technique for use in children under the age of six years. The development of the SalivaBio offers potential for salivary collection, which is safe, easy and less-invasive than current practice. The SaliPac has been developed to offer a more tolerable and pleasant way of sampling saliva using a SalivaBio in very young children which the investigators envisage being used by parents/carers at home to sample and then post to the hospital for GC analysis.
Oral Hedgehog Inhibitors in the Treatment of Basal Cell Carcinoma in the Netherlands: a Prospective Registration Study Background: Oral hedgehog inhibitors vismodegib and sonidegib have been used for the treatment of locally advanced (laBCC), metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC) and in basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) patients. In the Netherlands, targeted therapy with vismodegib and sonidegib has been available since 2013 and 2021, respectively. No direct comparative studies have been performed between the two oral hedgehog inhibitors (HHI) vismodegib and sonidegib yet . In addition, data for sonidegib are not yet available.  Objective: The aim of this study is 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of oral HHIs in the treatment of laBCC, mBCC and BCNS patients and 2) to compare the oral HHIs vismodegib and sonidegib.  Study design: prospective registration study that includes all patients, regardless of age and gender, with histologically proven basal cell carcinoma receiving treatment with either vismodegib or sonidegib in the Netherlands. Patient, tumor and treatment information was gathered from patient records.  Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome for measuring efficacy/tumor response was median progression free survival (PFS) where the decrease, stagnation or increase in tumor size is measured by maximum diameter. Secondary outcomes are frequency, severity and reversibility of treatment-emergent adverse events and disease-specific quality of life expressed as mean scores on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and aBCCdex questionnaires.

The primary hypotheses are that participants who respond to pembrolizumab have:  1. a higher fraction of cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (FCT) at baseline compared to those who do not respond to pembrolizumab 2. a higher fold-increase in FCT compared to baseline than those who do not respond to pembrolizumab 3. a higher Average Specific Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Frequency Ratio (ASCTFR) compared to those who do not respond to pembrolizumab
Mindfulness-based Therapy Versus Relaxation in Prevention of Burnout in Medical Students A recent survey exploring mental health in a large cohort of French medical students and young graduates (N = 21.768), observed that 68.2% of participants showed pathologic anxiety. A high level of depressive symptomatology was found in 27.7% of participants, while suicidal ideation was reported by 23.7%. Mindfulness Based Interventions are beneficial for health with a positive impact on mood, anxiety, and well-being. It thus can be hypothesized that such interventions could help to prevent anxio-depressive symptomatology in medical students.  The implementation of prevention programs to promote resilience to stress and empathy among medical students is a priority, included in French National Strategy for Health. Efficacy of Mindfulness Based Interventions in French university must be studied to confirm and strengthen their development. The originality of this project consists in the collaboration of medical schools from different cities and the longitudinal follow-up.  The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a mindfulness-based therapy in burnout prevention in comparison to relaxation.
In Vivo Confocal Microscopy Study of Pigmented Conjunctival Lesions This study aims to validate the use of laser in vivo confocal microscopy as an early diagnostic and differentiation tool of pigmented conjunctival lesions, evaluate the efficacy of in vivo confocal microscopy for follow-up (as a visualizing tool) after tumor resection for early detection of tumor recurrence, and to evaluate the use of in vivo confocal microscopy in evaluation of response to treatment. The modified technique with Heidelberg Retina Tomography (HRT) confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) are non-invasive, no-touch, imaging techniques that may help in differentiation of benign lesions like nevi or racial melanosis, from malignant lesions like primary acquired melanosis and malignant melanomas. The OCT will potentially allow to estimate tumor depth in vivo as preliminary studies have shown.

Legalon SIL for the Treatment of HCV Recurrence in Liver Transplanted Patients Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment of choice for patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection and end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma; infection of the graft and hepatitis C recurrence is universal after OLT and recurrent HCV hepatitis often follows an accelerated course after OLT, with rapid histological recurrence and cirrhosis. These very poor outcome significantly affect graft and patient survival and reduces the benefit of transplantation for this indication. Therapeutic strategies are not available; high viral load, high prevalence of genotype 1b and need of dose reduction of interferon and ribavirin because of the side effects or intolerance, together with the interference of immunosuppressive drugs, resulted in the vast majority of the patients in failure in obtaining viral eradication.  Recently, Silibinin, has been studied and reported to be capable to act as potent antiviral agent in patients with HCV; it has been used successfully in a protocol of a 14 day intravenous infusion in previous non-responders to peginterferon/ribavirin therapy. In view of his postulated profile of safety, it seems an ideal drug to be used in the setting of HCV recurrent patients after liver transplant.  Aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is to determine the therapeutic effect of Legalon SIL in the prevention of HCV reinfection in chronically infected hepatitis C patients after OLT.  Awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation patients affected by HCV will be randomised 3:1 to receive, in addition to their current therapy, silibinin 20mg/kg/day (Legalon SIL) or placebo infused over 2 hours from 14 to 21 consecutive days; in addition, patients will receive treatment with silibinin 20mg/kg/day (Legalon SIL), infused over 2 hours, for 7 days after transplant.  The Primary Efficacy endpoint is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) while Secondary Efficacy endpoints are to evaluate the virologic response, the percentage of patients who has a decreased of at least 2 log10 the levels of HCV-RNA and the safety of Legalon SIL in this population.

Analyzing the Urine During BCG Instillation in Bladder Cancer Patients for Disease Followup Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been extensively utilized in intravesical instillation therapy for patients with medium to high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Nevertheless, the efficacy of BCG instillation can fluctuate between patients, with 40.5% experiencing disease recurrence during BCG therapy. The effectiveness of BCG instillation may be linked to the urinary microbiome and immune microenvironment. Additionally, small residual lesions post-TURBT could also result in bladder cancer recurrence. Low coverage whole genome sequencing (LC-WGS) can be used to detect the urinary microbiome and chromosomal instability (CIN), making it feasible to predict the recurrence or progression of bladder cancer during BCG instillation therapy. Here, we intend to evaluate the feasibility of detecting urine samples of bladder cancer patients receiving BCG instillation to predict the bladder cancer recurrence.

Effect of Tourniquet Application on Postoperative Functional Outcome Following Total Knee Arthroplasty A pneumatic tourniquet is often used during total knee arthroplasty. However, its effect on postoperative outcomes as soft tissue damage resulting in delayed recovery remains unclear. The purpose of the present study was to compare tourniquet use versus non-tourniquet use during total knee arthroplasty for short-term functional recovery.
Arm Cycling in Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy (FSHD) Patients The investigators believe that arm cycling has the potential to be effective in maintaining or improving shoulder muscle functioning. However, there is no evidence for its safety or effectiveness in the upper extremity. The aim of the study is to establish the ability of FSHD sufferers to perform arm cycling to underpin the future design of an arm exercise trial. The study hypothesis is that the limited range of shoulder movement and muscle weakness should not impact the ability of FSHD sufferers to perform arm cycling.
Transepithelial Corneal Collagen Crosslinking for Keratoconus and Corneal Ectasia Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) has been proposed as an effective method of reducing progression of both keratoconus and corneal ectasia after surgery, as well as possibly decreasing the steepness of the cornea in these pathologies. During previous studies of the CXL procedure, the surface epithelial cells have been removed. Transepithelial crosslinking in which the epithelium is not removed has been proposed to offer a number of advantages over traditional crosslinking including an increased safety profile by reducing the risk for infection as no epithelial barrier will be broken, faster visual recovery and improved patient comfort in the early postoperative healing period.

Non Invasive Mapping Before Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation. RATIONALE / CONTEXT The ECG records the electrical activity propagating along cardiac cells (from the atria to the ventricles). The standard 12 ECG leads placed on the chest measure the global activation of the heart and do not have the ability to detect small-scale disturbances or to pinpoint ectopic activity. By the 1960s, multiple electrodes were placed around the chest to try to understand the complexity of the distribution of electrical activity in relation to the single cardiothoracic geometry of each individual. The safety of this method is similar to the ECG but its superiority has been demonstrated by the detection of anomalies imperceptible to the standard ECG. The accuracy of the technique in localizing rhythm disturbances is on the order of 5 mm.  OBJECTIVES Main objective: To evaluate the utility of noninvasive mapping during persistent AF electrophysiology procedure  Secondary objectives:  1. Compare the effectiveness of noninvasive mapping compared to conventional standard of care methods for AF mapping and ablation procedure. 2. Evaluate the absence of recurrence of persistent AF after a follow up of 12 months after the procedure during a scheduled hospitalization.  DIAGRAM OF RESEARCH European Diagnostic Study, feasibility, non-randomized, multi center  RESEARCH PROCEDURES A trained clinical specialist places 252 dry gelled ECG electrodes on the patient's torso. The 252 ECG electrode array is hooked up to the CardioInsight system and body surface ECG recordings are made during the patient's arrhythmia. The patient is then sent to the radiology department for a CT scan (no contrast) to image both the heart and electrodes on the patient's torso. A trained clinical specialist from CardioInsight then segments the CT DICOM images from the CT scan to obtain epicardial anatomy and establish heart-torso geometry.  The electrograms are processed by the system to produce movies of fibrillatory activity (both focal activity, and rotor activity).  PROCEDURAL ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint: Acute AF termination to atrial tachycardia or sinus rhythm  Secondary outcome criteria:  * Reduction in RF time compared to standard of care (historical control - comparable patient population) * Reduction in procedure time compared to standard of care (historical control - comparable patient population) * Freedom from persistent AF at the end of the 12 months F/U period STUDY SIZE  The sample size was estimated at 100 patients, with up to 20 patients per center STUDY CENTERS 8 Centers :  * Brugmann - Brussels (Belgium) * Clinique Pasteur - Toulouse (France) * Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik - Mainz (Germany) * University ed Herzzentrum Freiburg Bad Kozingen (Germany) * Deutsches Herzzentrum München, Munich (Germany) * Kerkhoff Klinik, Bad Nauheim, (Germany) * Sint-Jan Sint-Franciscus Xaverius, Brugge (Belgium) * Clinique Ambroise Paré, Paris, France  EXPECTED OUTCOME In patients referred for ablation of persistent AF, ECG mapping data will be correlated to the invasive procedure. It is expected that procedure time will be statistically shorter and total RF energy delivery is expected to be smaller than that of standard of care for AF treatment.
ENHANCED Device Programming to Reduce Therapies and Improve Quality of Life in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Patients The purpose of this study is to determine whether Enhanced device programming to reduce therapies (i.e. anti tachycardia pacing (ATP) episodes and shocks (both appropriate and inappropriate)) is safe for patients implanted with an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD). The secondary objective is to examine the impact of Enhanced programming on (i) ATPs and shocks (both appropriate and inappropriate) and (ii) quality of life and distress.
Use Lay Language. HA Score to Identify Myeloma Patients Who Could Benefit From HDACi Treatment Panobinostat is a potent oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that alters gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms and inhibits protein degradation. It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) who have received ≥ 2 prior regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug.  A GEP-based histone acetylation score allowing identification of MM patients with a poor prognosis and who could benefit from HDACi treatment was recently reported(Moreaux et al. BJC. 2013).  Our hypothesis is that the histone acetylation score could be promising to identify MM patients who could benefit from treatment with HDACi and the development of personalized treatment.
Internal Jugular Vein Distensibility and Pleth Variability Index(PVI) for Evaluating Fluid Responsiveness Assessment of intravascular volume status is crucial in order to predict the efficacy of volume status in major abdominal surgery.

A Randomized Trial of 4% Nebulized Lignocaine vs. 10% Lignocaine Spray in Patients Undergoing Flexible Bronchoscopy Flexible bronchoscopy is common procedure used in the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of tracheobronchial diseases. During routine diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy, the most distressing symptom experienced by the patients is a cough, and control of a cough is vital for a successful procedure. The investigators hypothesized that either nebulized lignocaine or lignocaine spray given alone prior to flexible bronchoscopy for inducing topical anesthesia will have similar efficacy compared to the combination of the two agents.
Compassionate Use Program With Lacosamide in Patients With Partial-onset or Generalized Tonic-clonic Seizures The objective of this Compassionate Use Program (CUP) is to provide continued access to Lacosamide (LCM) for monotherapy use for patients who were receiving LCM in SP0993 and SP0994 at the time of study unblinding and close of SP0994, and who benefited from the treatment per investigator assessment.
Phenotypic Description of Patients With Atypical Clinical Forms of PLA2G6 Mutations Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene are well known in the classical phenotype called infantile neuro-axonal dystrophy (INAD), a severe neurodegenerative disease starting in infancy with homogeneous clinical, radiological, electrophysiological and pathophysiological features, with early death. Other clinical forms in pediatric patients called atypic INAD have been described in some patients. Expansion of high-throughput sequencing in the last decades has lead to identify mutations in the PLA2G6 gene in pediatric patients with late-onset phenotypes associating progressive ataxia, spastic paraplegia, cognitive regression and/or dystonia / parkinsonism. A high variability in radiological and electrophysiological findings is also described. Less than twenty patients with a pediatric onset have been reported with an atypical INAD. Very poor data are available on management and therapeutic options in these patients and global prognostic is not known. This multicentric retrospective study will record clinical, radiological, electrophysiological and pathophysiological data in pediatric patients with genetically confirmed atypical INAD. Management, therapeutics and evolution of the disease will also be recorded.
ESKETamine for FIBromyalgia Treatment Fibromyalgia is a cause of chronic pain, classified by the Internal Classification of Diseases (ICD) as a primary chronic pain with specific diagnostic criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). No treatment to its complete cure is available at this time, all treatments having as purpose pain relief and an improvement of quality of life by combining pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. One of the mechanisms proposed in fibromyalgia is the central sensitisation phenomenon, by which the central nervous system becomes "hypersensitive" to nociceptive or non-nociceptive stimuli. The receptor involved in this phenomenon is the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor to which ketamine binds. Ketamine has therefore been proposed as a co-treatment in chronic pain with central sensitization phenomena, such as fibromyalgia.

Accuracy of Open-source Software in Semi-automatic 3-Dimensional Reconstruction of the Mandible Concomitant to the evolution of CBCT devices, several post-processing software packages were developed for producing 3D-printed models of anatomical structures. In the last few years, several open-source software used as an alternative to commercial software for 3D reconstruction of anatomical structures such as the mandible. However, no sufficient evidence validating the accuracy of this open-source software.
Phase I-II Study of Vorinostat, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab in Metastatic Breast Cancer This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together with paclitaxel and bevacizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer and/or breast cancer that has recurred in the chest wall and cannot be removed by surgery. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.
Treatment Response to Xiaflex for Men With Peyronie's Disease The purpose of this research study is to develop a database of patients with Peyronie's disease who are treated at the University of Miami.

Effectiveness of Mometasone Nasal Irrigation for Chronic Rhinosinusitis Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects up to 12.5% of the US population and has a significant disease burden. The recommended medical management of CRS includes large-volume, low-pressure saline lavage, systemic antibiotics, and intranasal corticosteroids (INCS). While the efficacy and safety of INCS are well-established for the long-term management of CRS, penetration of INCS beyond the nasal vestibule and into the paranasal sinuses is limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mometasone furoate large-volume, low-pressure nasal irrigation for surgery-naive CRS patients.
Pathogenesis of Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Liver Regeneration After Bariatric Surgery Obesity and obesity related health problems are globally recognized as one of the major threats to public health. Bariatric surgery is the most effective and durable therapy option for obesity and the improvement of obesity related co-morbidities. "Non alcoholic steatohepatitis" (NASH) is an important comorbidity of obesity and improves after surgical intervention. In this study investigators try to enlighten the weight independent mechanism for the effects of bariatric surgery. Patients who are assigned to a bariatric procedure will be observed for at least 24 month. A liver and adipose tissue samples are gained during the operation. Liver function and morphology are observed before and after operation with LiMAx, FibroScan and ultrasound. Systemic inflammation is measured in blood samples before and after surgical intervention. In order to check the microbiome stool samples are collected throughout the entire observation period.

Direct Effect of Caffeine on Diaphragmatic Muscles The mechanism of methylxanthines is thought to increase chemoreceptor responsiveness to CO2 in central nervous system. Besides, effect of methylxanthines on diaphragmatic contractility has also been found in experimental studies. A study of premature newborns has showed caffeine increase diaphragmatic activity and tidal volume. But, there is limited data about caffeine direct effect on diaphragma.  Objective: The investigators aimed to show the direct effect of caffeine on diphragmatic contractility.  Method: The babies under 32 weeks with respiratory support, are being enrolled in this study if caffeine treatment is decided to receive. Evaluation of muscle contraction is being made by ultrasound before and 30 minutes after caffeine loading dose. Right and left sides of diaphragm thickness are being measured by two clinicians on B mode ultrasound by anterior subcostal view. The velocity before and after caffeine administration will be calculated, dividing excursion frequency (parameter) for inspiratory time. Movement of the diaphragm at inspiratory and expiratory phases are also observed on M mode and the difference between the two phases are measured.

Pharmacokinetic Study in Healthy Volunteers Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate insulin exposure using different formulations of Technosphere Insulin Inhalation Powder using the Gen2 inhaler in healthy normal volunteers.
Retinal Vessel Measurements as Clinically Useful Predictors in Veterans Diabetic complications are an important source of blindness and mortality among Veterans. Their occurrence is unpredictable because of the highly variable effect of factors such as weight, diet and exercise. Improved prediction of diabetes complications has the potential to improve the care for Veterans with diabetes, especially if this can be done without any extra effort for the Veterans or their caretakers. All Veterans with diabetes in VHA are required to undergo annual retinal photography to screen for current diabetic retinopathy. The investigators have recently developed an automated, precise, fast, novel tool for measuring retinal vessels in these images. Manual measurement of retinal vessels has shown that these can predict future -not current- development of hypertension and also diabetic retinopathy. If the investigators can confirm that their tool can flag those Veterans at increased risk for developing these diabetes complications, this will allow earlier intervention and prevention. Because the tool only uses the images that are being taken anyway, there is no extra effort for either the Veteran or VA staff.
Clinical Assessment of Nonin 7600 Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Tissue Oximetry During Cardiovascular Surgery An observational study designed to evaluate the performance of a new Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) tissue oximeter device in the clinical setting, including a cerebral sensor and peripheral sensor. Fifty patients who are undergoing open-heart surgery will be enrolled and tissue oximetry measurement will be collected throughout the surgical procedure and for up to 24 hours following surgery. Tissue oximeter measurement of the brain and skeletal tissue will be added to the standard intra-operative patient monitoring. Measures of delirium will be collected using a standardized questionnaire. The relationship between cerebral oximetry measures and delirium scores will be explored.
A Trial of the Urine LAM Strip Test for TB Diagnosis Amongst Hospitalized HIV-infected Patients The novel urine LAM point-of-care strip test offers potential clinical utility to improve TB diagnosis in HIV co-infected patients. Urine LAM strip test performance improves with increasing illness severity and more advanced immunosuppression, thus offering the greatest potential utility in hospitalised HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count less than 200). However, in the context of high rates of empiric treatment and the availability of other novel TB diagnostics, the clinical impact of the urine LAM strip test is unknown. This study will investigate the impact of the urine LAM strip test. The study hypothesis is that the urine LAM strip test, when combined with standard TB diagnostics (smear microscopy and culture) will significantly improve TB treatment-related outcomes (TB-related mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay) in HIV-infected hospitalized patients when compared to standard TB diagnostics alone.
The Effect of Different Masks Used by Pregnant Women on Vital Signs and Non Stress Test During The COVID-19 This study was conducted to examine the effects of different masks used by pregnant women on vital signs and non stress test (NST) during the COVID-19. This study was conducted as a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Healthy pregnant women aged 19 years and older, who were followed up on an outpatient basis, and who were in the 37-40th week of pregnancy, were included in the study. The study consisted of a single surgical mask group (n=30), double surgical mask group (n=30), and N95 mask group (n=31). Masks were given to the resting pregnant women 30 minutes before the NST, and they were provided to wear masks. After 30 minutes, the vital signs of the pregnant women were measured just before and after the NST, and the images of the NST traces were taken.
MEK Inhibitor MEK162 in Combination With Leucovorin Calcium, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin in Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MEK inhibitor MEK162 when given together with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in treating patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. MEK inhibitor MEK162 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving MEK inhibitor MEK162 with leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin may kill more tumor cells.
Duration of Vitamin D Stores After Prolonged Vitamin D Substitution Ingested or skin produced vitamin D is either hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), metabolized and excreted in the urine, or stored in adipose and other tissues. The capacity for vitamin D storage in adipose tissue is not known, nor the importance of such storage which may potentially be of vital importance when intake or solar exposure is limited. In the present study we will include 76 subjects who have participated in an intervention study with vitamin D (20.000 IU per week) versus placebo for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, and who have completed the study after 5 years or who have been excluded because of diagnosed type 2 diabetes or for other reasons. If vitamin D is stored to any extent in the body the subjects given 20.000 IU vitamin D per week for 2-5 years will have a considerable amount of stored vitamin D and accordingly, a slow decline in serum 25(OH)D during the following year without vitamin D substitution, which will be measured in the present study. If our hypothesis is correct, that vitamin D can be stored in significant amounts when the supply is abundant; current advice on vitamin D supplementation mainly during winter should be changed to "year around" in order to build up sufficient stores for the months without sufficient sun light.
Effects of Mannitol on Delayed Graft Function After Cadaveric Renal Transplantation In this study we want to evaluate the effect of mannitol on postoperative renal biomarkers in patient receiving cadaveric renal transplantation. Furthermore we want to evaluate the effect of mannitol on perioperative redox status in patients receiving renal transplantation using the oxidation-reduction potentials assessed with the RedoxSYS®system.  We are planning to perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial. In the study, mannitol 20% with a dose of 1g / kg / BW (5 ml / kg / BW) will be compared to placebo with NaCl 0.9% in the dose of 5 ml / kg / BW. Patients will be randomized to receive either the mannitol or NaCl. The follow-up of the study is 24 hours. The following biomarkers will be determined befor induction of anesthesia and 24 hours after administration of study medication: CCL2, CHI3LI, GH, HGF, MMP1, MMP8, Tie2, TNF-R1, VCAM-1, KIM-1, Cystatin C, FGF23, IGFB7, NGAL and IL 18.  Furthermore we want to perform sORP and cORP before induction of anesthesia, just before bolus of mannitol, 5 min after bolus of mannitol and after operation in anesthetic recovery room.  Data will be collected, compared and published at the end of the study. It is planned to include a total of 34 patients in the study.
LuCID - Investigating the Use of a Novel Digital Rectoscope for Community Examinations During COVID-19 The LumenEye scope and CHiP platform will be piloted in a number of clinical settings including remote colorectal clinics. The rationale is to perform an initial pilot study to determine the clinical utility of the LumenEye device for use in primary and secondary care settings.  The main hypothesis is that digital rectoscopy is safe and acceptable to clinicians including general practitioners and can significantly reduce the burden of endoscopy referral to and within secondary care centres.
Survey of Cancer Patients' Perceptions of Difficulties Encountered When Filling Opioid Prescriptions This trial studies the problems that cancer patients face when filling prescriptions for opioids (medications that are used to manage pain). Pain is one of the most common symptoms among cancer patients. Opioid therapy is generally the treatment of choice for adequate management of cancer-related pain. Knowledge of these problems may help health care providers assess the most effective treatment options for cancer patients, and inform policy makers of the adjustments that need to be made to regulations to ensure cancer patients don't lose their access to opioids.
Prehabilitation Physical Activity in Persons With Osteoarthritis Knee joint osteoarthritis (OA) reduces functional mobility and performance of daily tasks such as rising from a chair. Therefore interventions aimed at improving muscle strength and sit-to-stand task performance are very important for these patients. The effect of exercise programs, including home exercise programs (HEP), on muscle strength, joint pain and function is well known and widely researched, yet not many studies have investigated the effect of an HEP on electromyographic activity (EMG) of muscles when performing everyday tasks, such as rising from and sitting on a chair. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of prehabilitation in women with severe knee joint OA scheduled for knee joint arthroplasty (TKA).

The Nor-Hand Study The Nor-Hand study is a hospital-based observational study including 300 patients with evidence of hand OA by ultrasound and/or clinical examination. The baseline examination (2016-17) consists of functional tests and joint assessment of the hands, medical assessment, pain sensitization tests, ultrasound (hands, acromioclavicular joint, hips, knees and feet), computer tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the dominant hand, conventional radiographs of the hands and feet, fluorescence optical imaging of the hands, collection of blood and urine samples as well as self-reported demographic factors and OA-related questionnaires. Two follow-up examinations are planned after 3 (2019-20) and 8 years (2024-25), respectively. Cross-sectional analyses will be used to investigate agreements and associations between different relevant measures at the baseline examination, whereas the longitudinal data will be used for evaluation of predictors for clinical outcomes and disease progression.
Exercise in Insulin-Resistant Minority Adolescents Insulin resistance, often accompanied by obesity, plays a major role in the development of type 2 diabetes. This phenomenon may be related with the fact that American adolescents are now becoming less physically active in early puberty, explaining the largely pubertal and post-pubertal onset of type 2 diabetes in adolescence. Although regular physical activity has been suggested to attenuate obesity and prevent type 2 diabetes in high-risk children and adolescents, the magnitude of exercise training-induced improvement in the risk factors for type 2 diabetes has been only recently studied in adults and studied very little in pediatric populations. It is clear that exercise, diet, and genetics all contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in children. However, the few studies that have been done to dissect the relative contributions of these three risk factors have generally used only lipid profiles as the end point. There have been a number of recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of type 2 diabetes, particularly, with regards to insulin regulatory pathways modulated by exercise within muscle tissue.

ICU Doulas Providing Psychological Support Many patients who survive critical illness suffer from symptoms of anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after leaving the intensive care unit (ICU). Memories of frightening and delusional experiences in the ICU appear to be the strongest potentially modifiable risk factor. Research on the formation of fear and associated memories shows that if mitigating information about a traumatic event is introduced during the time between memory formation and its recall, the emotional experience of the memory can be modified in a positive manner. This means that in order to prevent mental health problems in critical illness survivors, psychological support needs to take place in parallel with medical treatment in the ICU. The Researchers hypothesize that early psychological support for the critically ill can decrease mental health morbidity in critical illness survivors. However, providing consistent psychological support intervention is a challenge for busy ICU clinicians. It is not feasible to hire behavioral medicine trained psychologists to become permanent ICU staff nationwide. Doulas, trained lay health care providers who provide emotional support to women in labor, have been identified as reliable yet affordable alternative. Given common elements of their services and our intervention, doulas are in an ideal position to administer early psychological support. The objective of this project is to refine and test a behavioral intervention to be administered in parallel with medical treatment in the ICU. This will be accomplished by training doulas in providing standardized psychological support intervention and refining the intervention based on stakeholder feedback

Rehabilitation After Fast-track Total Knee Arthroplasty BACKGROUND In 2008 approximately 7,700 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed in Denmark. The results after TKA is in general very good, the investigators have, however, discovered that patients following fast-track TKA still have a deficit 12 months postoperatively of 5-10% in health-related quality-of-life and 15-20% in activity and participation when compared to age- and gender matched population. A postoperative rehabilitation intervention has the potential to reduce or remove this observed deficit. The current evidence of postoperative rehabilitation after TKA is, however, scares and conflicting, and no studies have shown a lasting effect beyond 3 months postoperatively.  PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to investigate if a 6-weeks postoperative rehabilitation intervention is more effective than supervised home training, and furthermore to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in a societal perspective.  MATERIALS \& METHODS The study is performed as a randomized clinical trial. In total 140 patients are included in the study. Inclusion criteria are age above 18 years, patients diagnosed as having knee arthrosis, patients receiving primary elective TKA, and patients who are able to and willing transport themselves to the rehabilitation center, which demands ability to walk 50 meter, and climb 10 stair steps. Exclusion criteria are unicompartmental or revision arthroplasty, any neurological disease, knee infection, and substantial pain or functional limitation hindering rehabilitation tested by physiotherapist prior to rehabilitation start. Primary endpoint is 6 months postoperatively and primary outcome measure is change in total score by using the knee specific questionnaire Oxford Knee Score.

Use of Cetuximab for Unresectable or Metastatic Esophageal and Gastric Cancer Purpose: There remains a great need for novel therapeutic agents and treatment strategies for advanced esophagogastric cancer. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated increased EGFR expression in a significant proportion of both esophageal and gastric carcinomas. Inactivation of EGFR through use of a monoclonal antibody in preclinical models has resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. Agents designed to block the EGFR pathway have demonstrated disease control among previously treated patients with metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer. The proposed mechanism of action for cetuximab is its ability to effectively disrupt EGFR-mediated signal transduction pathways that ultimately leads to halting cell cycle progression, induces apoptosis, and also inhibits processes important for tumor growth, such as cell invasion and angiogenesis.

The Effect of Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy on Glycemic Control and Bacterial Levels in a Mexican-American Population With Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a significant pandemic with more than 7% of the population in the United States affected. Moreover, up to one-third of these individuals may not be aware of the diagnosis and, are not involved in treatment. In the Mexican-American population, prevalence rates may be up to 50%. Contributing factors such as poor education, low household income, language barriers and restricted access to medical services may increase this prevalence. The association between periodontal disease and diabetes has been well documented; however, interventional studies have resulted in conflicting conclusions on improvements in glycemic control following periodontal therapy.  Diabetes and periodontal disease share common pathways in pathogenesis, such as their polygenic nature and immunoregulatory dysfunction. To answer these questions, we, the investigators, propose this randomized controlled trial designed to elucidate how treatment of periodontal disease can be used for preventive and therapeutic purposes in a diabetic population as well as to study the role of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphisms as a risk factor for the presence of periodontitis in a Hispanic T2DM population. Our central hypothesis is that the Mexican-American T2DM population in Texas is at risk for an increased presence and severity of periodontal disease due to the presence of Il-1 gene cluster polymorphisms; furthermore we suggest that providing non-surgical periodontal therapy to this group will decrease the bacterial load associated with disease and as a consequence, will improve glycemic control as measured by HbA1c values. Our long-term goal is to study risk factors associated with the presence of periodontal disease and to understand how the treatment of periodontal disease can be used for preventive and therapeutic purposes in a Hispanic type 2 diabetic population.

Enhancement of Residual Limb Proprioception and Rehabilitation Training Methods With a Vibrotactile Device. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate attentional (internal vs. external) focus effects on persons with amputation to perform a defined compensatory movement to reduce the likelihood of a fall. An internal focus of attention directs a person's conscious attention to their body's movements, whereas an external focus of attention directs a person's conscious attention to the effects of their movements or specific features in the environment. Numerous experiments have investigated the effects of an internal and external focus of attention on motor performance and the findings are in favor of an external focus of attention. In our work, we propose a motor learning research experiment to evaluate attentional focus strategies on the rehabilitation outcomes of learning and adaptation to the new proprioceptive information for persons with a recent transtibial amputation.  Research Design and Methodology: For this pilot study, six participants with recent unilateral transtibial amputation will be recruited. Four participants will receive internal and external focus of attention training methods while the other two (control group) will receive standard prosthetic training instructions. The experiment will be conducted in three phases: Phase 1 -- Baseline Performance Test, Phase 2 -- Training sessions, and Phase 3 - Learning Test. The training will utilize a vibrotactile device designed to generate tactile sensations at the skin-socket interface simulating contact of the prosthesis with the environment. The sensation simulates a perturbation that signals a potential fall event. During the experiment the augmented sensory information will be introduced randomly while participants walk at a preferred pace on a level surface. Movement kinematics and kinetics of the body will be recorded for analyses using a motion capture system with force plates.  Finding: It is hypothesized that the external focus of attention condition will outperform the internal focus of attention condition when responding to perturbations. The external focus of attention condition will yield faster response time and show improved compensatory responses compared to the internal focus of attention group by producing a greater lateral displacement of the artificial limb relative to the line of progression. In addition, the external condition will demonstrate a greater step length and step height than the internal focus of attention condition when provided with a perturbation.  Clinical Significance: Current practices within the field of Physical Therapy reveal that there is little therapeutic intervention for fall prevention. Instructions are traditionally provided on how to reduce the risk of falling through preparation of a room or obstacle avoidance or on the proper way to fall to decrease injury. However, there are no protocols for providing a prosthetic user with compensatory strategies to avoid a fall after a perturbation occurs. The research findings can result in improved training protocols, which can improve rehabilitative outcome.  Impact/Significance: The growing number of prosthetic users presents a need for improved patient care and effective prosthetic training and rehabilitation methods. Complimentary to the mission of the VA, the results of this research could enhance the quality of patient care and further assist these patients toward becoming prosthetically rehabilitated.

A Multicenter Cohort Study of HPV Viral Load in Predicting the Postoperative Recurrence of HSIL Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has become one of the most important health problems faced by women all over the world. A large number of studies have shown that women's cervical, vaginal and perianal precancerous lesions, related cancers, condyloma acuminatum and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are closely related to HPV infection. Among them, the persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is closely related to the occurrence of invasive cervical cancer. Previous studies have shown that there are significant differences in the effects of multiple HPV infection and persistent infection of different types (such as type-16, -18, -39 and -52) on different levels of cervical lesions, and there is a certain correlation between HPV load in the process of persistent infection and the degree of cervical lesions. In addition, other studies have shown that HPV-16 viral load has certain clinical significance in predicting Cin2 / CIN3 high-grade cervical lesions, and HPV viral load level is significantly different in cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The above biological changes such as HPV infection type, quantity and proportion can promote the occurrence and development of cervical precancerous lesions and related cancers to varying degrees. It can be seen that the study of the relationship between HPV viral load and cervical lesions is of great significance for clinical disease development prediction and cervical cancer screening.
New Maneuver to Facilitate Fiberoptic Intubation for Difficult Airway We propose the additional technique of lingual traction or "tongue pulling" in conjunction with use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope for facilitating successful first attempts at and decreasing time to intubation of the difficult airway and rescuing otherwise failed intubation attempts. Induction of general anesthesia causes relaxation and approximation of the soft palate, base of the tongue, epiglottis, and posterior pharyngeal wall, creating unfavorable anatomic changes in the pharynx for successful intubation. The use of lingual traction can assist in diminishing these problems by clearing the tongue away from the soft palate and uvula and lifting the epiglottis from the posterior pharyngeal wall, especially in the unanticipated difficult airway patient.
Patient-Reported Outcomes Integrated in the Follow-up of Patients With Hematological Cancer This study investigates if integration of patient-reported outcomes in the follow-up of patients with newly diagnosed, not curable, chronic hematological cancer changes the number and kind of supportive care interventions. Furthermore, this study investigates if the patients feel that they are more involved in a positive way when patient-reported outcomes are integrated in the follow-up of their cancer.
Comparison of Endotracheal Intubation Using Flexible Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy Versus Flexible Intubation Video Endoscope (FIVE) in Obese Patients Undergoing Elective Surgeries Under General Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial Tracheal intubation is one of the most common medical procedures performed in hospitals. On one hand, it is highly successful and easy to perform using a rigid laryngoscope. On the other hand, hypoxic brain damage and death may result rapidly if it is unsuccessful. This disastrous outcome happens when the airway cannot be secured by intubation and face mask ventilation becomes difficult.  Careful preoperative evaluation to identify patients in whom tracheal intubation and mask ventilation may prove to be difficult can save lives.  Over the past 40 years, different techniques of tracheal intubation have been introduced, the most effective under different conditions being fiberoptic intubation.  The flexible intubation video endoscope is a relatively new device which delivers clear, pixel-free images without a Moiré pattern. The flexible intubation video endoscope can be directly connected to the C-MAC® monitor. Due to the Distal Chip technology the user enjoys a full-format direct video imaging with improved image quality with a resolution higher than fiberoptic bronchoscopy which has another disadvantage of being Fragile where Fibres can be broken or have transmission loss when wrapped around curves of only a few centimeters radius.  After ethics approval and informed consent from patients, 60 obese patients aging from 20-60 years will randomly allocated and divided into two groups each is (Thirty) patients in each group, using flexible intubation video endoscope(FIVE) in (group1) and fiberoptic bronchoscopy in (group 2).  The study will compare the techniques for time of intubation, hemodynamic (SBP, DBP and HR) changes, success rate, number of attempts and complications in both groups.  investigators expect from this study that flexible intubation video endoscope(FIVE) has become a good alternative and associated with better visualization of laryngeal structures in shorter time as compared to traditional flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
Comparison of the Efficiency of Classical and I-GEL LMAs Selected by Different Methods in Providing a Safe Airway In recent years, the use of laryngeal masks has been increasing in operating room and non-operating room anesthesia applications. Patients with inappropriate LMA may develop high leakages, gastric distension and inadequate ventilation during ventilation. If the laryngeal masks used to provide a safe airway in the patient are not selected in the appropriate size, adequate ventilation may not be provided, which may lead to various complications such as increased morbidity and mortality. In order to prevent and predict the bad results that may occur, we foresee which method can be chosen more appropriately for the patients and will guide the clinicians.

Early Sensory Re-education of the Hand With a Sensor Glove Model The implementation of early sensory re-education (SR) techniques, aimed to preserve the cortical hand area, such as the use of audio-tactile interaction, becomes an important strategy to obtain also a better sensory function. The aim of this study was to investigate sensory function outcomes (threshold monofilaments, two-point discrimination test, STI and DASH) and cortical responses (fMRI) in patients submitted to an early protocol of SR of the hand with a sensor glove model. After surgical repair of median and/or ulnar nerves, 17 participants were divided into two groups: the training group, trained on the protocol with the sensor glove model, and the control group, untrained. After six-month follow-up, no difference was observed between groups, related to sensory function, especially tactile gnosis. Despite this, the early training with this sensor glove model seems to provide some type of cortical audio-tactile interaction, contributing to previous studies that focus in early SR of the hand using the integration of different sensory modalities.
Surveillance of Suspected Dengue Cases for Access to Care for Subjects Identified as Seronegative or Undetermined Before Receiving CYD Dengue Vaccine in Previous Clinical Studies in Colombia The primary objective of the study is to identify any suspected dengue case in subjects that received at least one dose of the CYD dengue vaccine who were classified as seronegative or undetermined at baseline (according to PRNT50 at baseline, or anti-non-structural protein 1 \[NS1\] test Post-dose 3) in the Colombian study sites of CYD15, CYD13, CYD29, CYD64, CYD65 trials in order to allow appropriate access to care until the completion of 10 years after the last CYD Dengue Vaccine received by each participant

Oral Zinc for the Treatment of Acute Diarrhea in US Children Diarrheal diseases are the third leading cause of mortality in the world, with nearly 2 million deaths annually among children under age 5 years. Several clinical trials of oral zinc supplementation performed in developing country populations have confirmed this nutrient's efficacy in reducing the severity and frequency of diarrhea. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended global use of zinc supplementation in all children with diarrhea despite little or no data from trials in industrialized/developed settings. In the United States over 4 million children suffer annually from diarrheal illness. Although mortality is not a significant factor in U.S. cases, 75% of all cases present to medical care resulting in over 200,000 hospitalizations annually for diarrhea. This has significant impact on U.S. healthcare costs, with an average of $391 per outpatient treatment and $2,549 per inpatient treatment spent on each episode of acute diarrheal illness. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral zinc in decreasing the duration of diarrhea in children treated as outpatients and in decreasing the duration of hospitalization in children treated as inpatients in an industrialized country. The results of this study promise to have a substantial impact on the management of a common pediatric health problem, and could conceivably affect direct and indirect healthcare costs to society.
Ameliorating Attention Problems in Children With Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) The purpose of this study is to assess whether methylphenidate is effective in enhancing the cognitive performance of children with the HbSS or HbSC genotype of SCD who have sustained neurological complications on laboratory-based measures of sustained attention, reaction time, and executive functions, and indirectly, verbal short-term and long-term memory.
The Effect of Washing Red Blood Cells on Post Heart Surgery Blood Loss When a child undergoes heart surgery, a heart lung machine is used to keep blood flowing while the child's own heart is stopped. After surgery, a significant amount of the child's own blood is left in this machine. In the case of small children, the relative amount of blood potentially lost to the child in this way is very large.  In older children, and those who have undergone less complicated surgery, this blood can all returned to the child. Giving the child back his or her own blood makes is less likely that the child will need a transfusion of donated blood.  However, in younger children, or in children who have undergone more complicated surgery, most or all of this blood is thrown away. This is because of worry that returning this blood may cause bleeding, and excessive bleeding is one of the most feared complications of heart surgery.  This project will explore a method whereby the red blood cells left in the heart lung machine can be returned to children without increasing the risk of bleeding. It will also carefully examine the exact causes of higher bleeding risk in children getting their own blood back so that in the future, all children can have their own blood returned at the end of surgery.

Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Interacting Protein (AIP) Gene Mutations in Acromegaly Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by growth hormone (GH) secreting pituitary adenoma in more than 95% of cases. Acromegaly can be seen sporadically or may be associated with a variety of genetic syndromes such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1, Carney Complex, familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) and Mc-Cune Albright Syndrome. The accompanying features of these syndromes and family history are helpful in the differential diagnosis. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-interacting protein (AIP) gene mutations can be seen sporadically as well as in FIPA. But the prescience of the presence of AIP mutation is limited by positive family history and early-onset of acromegaly. Furthermore, the probability of the patient to be the index case of the family should not be ignored.  Screening for AIP gene mutation is recommended in patients with pituitary adenomas of childhood-onset, GH or prolactin secreting tumors who are diagnosed before the age of 30 years and positive family history in two or more family members according to present evidence in the literature. It is also known that AIP mutation is usually associated with more aggressive clinical behavior due to unclarified reasons.  The prevalence of AIP mutation in Turkish population and types of mutations have not been defined previously. The primary aim of the present study is to define the AIP gene mutation prevalence and the relation with clinical and tumour behaviour in a subgroup of Turkish acromegalic patients. If AIP gene mutation is detected in some patients, it will be possible to screen the family of the patient for the presence of AIP mutation or at least for the presence of pituitary adenoma.  Acromegalic patients who are followed in Erciyes University Medical School Department of Endocrinology will be enrolled into the study. After DNA isolation, each exon of AIP gene including splicing points will be reproduced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and will be analyzed for the presence of mutation by sequence analysis. The cases will be analyzed further in means of clinical features according to presence of AIP gene mutation.  The prevalence of AIP gene mutation, clinical reflection of presence of AIP mutation will be determined and genetic consultation will be given to the carriers of AIP gene mutation at the end of the study.
A 3D Tablet Sensor Approach to the Measurement of a Lymphedema Up to now, the diagnosis of lymphedema remains hard and delayed. It suffers from many limitations such as lack of coordination and formation of the health-care network. The diversity of used tools is another obstacle because all provided solutions on the market are either costless with poor accuracy, or highly expensive but with excellent accuracy. Therefore, we decided to evaluate an affordable and open-source 3D iPad sensor sharing the same technology used in Kinect sensors.
Nutritional Support for Cardiac Rehabilitation In this randomized trial the primary outcome is to assess if high doses of whey protein supplement may lower pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6).  Hypothesis: Secondary outcomes are to assess if high doses of whey protein supplement may lower pro-inflammatory interleukin 1β (IL-1 β), tumor necrosis factor and C Reactive Protein (CRP); may increase anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) plasma concentrations and may change Gut Microbiota (GM) composition.
Collagenase and Needle Aponeurotomy: Single Modality Versus Combination Treatment for Dupuytren's Disease Dupuytren's disease results in deformity of the hand and this can lead to trouble with daily activities. Treatment traditionally involves cutting out diseased tissue, however this can cause damage to important structures in the hand and results in large scars.  Needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injections are newer treatments that are thought to be safer. These treatments allow quicker return to function. One drawback is that Dupuytren's deformity may return more quickly than when all diseased tissue is surgically cut out.  This research study is designed to compare the effectiveness of needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injection for Dupuytren's disease. This study will determine which procedure gives the best results- either needle aponeurotomy, collagenase injection, or both procedures in combination. Participants will be evaluated to see how they do in the long term.

Patient factors contributing to this primary outcome as well as the effect on patient attitude and experience will also be investigated.
Social Cognition Dysfunctions in Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is usually responsible of cognitive and behavioral non-motor signs with a major impact on the quality of life. Social cognition is a complex system relying on emotion recognition (neurons mirror system (NMS)), the theory of mind (with its two parts: emotional and cognitive), but also on the social and cultural environment and the personal history. The first step in this model is represented by the NMS, which seems to be altered in PD patients for both positive and negative emotions as shown in our preliminary study. The investigator purpose is to investigate the role of the treatment (levodopa and deep brain stimulation) on the functioning of the NMS

Long-term Effects of Accidental Dural Puncture in Patients Having Had an Epidural Blood Patch (LEAP) Accidental dural puncture (ADP) during placement of an epidural catheter for anesthesia and analgesia is a well known complication. Previous studies have found audiometric deterioration following ADP. Epidural blood patch (EBP) is a common method for treating postural headache in patients with accidental dural puncture. In most cases, one-two patches are needed for successful management. Long-term effects of EBP on the incidence of backache, headache and early audiometric deterioration are few or non-existant. The present study aims to determine the long-term sequelae of EDP in parturients who had ADP and were treated with an EBP during the years 2005 - 2011.
Verifying the Specificity of a New Method in Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Gastric Cancer Patients Early gastric cancer is defined as gastric cancer that only invades mucosal or submucosal layer. The 5-year survival rate of gastric cancer can exceed 90% due to appropriate treatment. The most important consideration is whether there is lymph node metastasis. Preoperative examination including gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and CT are not accurate enough to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. In a retrospective study, we created a nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. In prospective validation, the sensitivity and specificity of the nomogram was 75% and 91%, respectively. Sentinel lymph node is a promising concept in early gastric cancer. Using carbon nanoparticles as tracer, the sensitivity and specificity of sentinel lymph node predicting lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer were 90% and 100%. Based on these results, we proposed a new method that combines the Nomogram and sentinel lymph node to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. First, the probability of lymph node metastasis of early gastric cancer patients is calculated by the Nomogram. Those with low incidence of lymph node metastasis continue to the sentinel lymph node procedure. A patient will be considered non lymph node metastasis if his/her frozen pathology of the sentinel lymph nodes is negative during the surgery. Then the standard radical gastrectomy is performed with lymphadenectomy. By comparing postoperative pathology and sentinel lymph node frozen pathology, the specificity of Nomogram combining sentinel lymph node predicting lymph node metastasis in early gastric patients is calculated. The primary endpoint of this research is that the specificity of the above-mentioned method is over 95%.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Adalimumab in Psoriasis Patients The main goal of this study is to determine optimal cut-off values of adalimumab trough levels corresponding to good clinical response. Determination of these values is necessary to compose a therapeutic algorithm, in which the dosing schedule can be adjusted according to serum trough levels of adalimumab and AAA (anti-adalimumab antibodies). A secondary objective of this study is to further detect and quantify AAA and to correlate them with adalimumab and clinical response in a real life setting cohort of psoriatic patients.
Neuroimaging Epigenetics of Prospective Postpartum Depression Biomarkers Through a recent cross species translational experiment, researchers have identified a set of epigenetic marks capable of predicting postpartum depression with greater than 85% accuracy. The researchers are looking to identify a group of women from both the general population and those with a history of mood disorders who are at risk for postpartum depression and obtain brain imaging data at a postpartum time period prior to the onset of depressive symptoms and compare it with those obtained during depressive episodes. The researchers will also evaluate the efficacy of postpartum depression biomarker prediction.

Decalcification of the Aortic Valve by Vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-7) Aortic Stenosis is a common but fatal disease when it becomes symptomatic, specially if not treated. Until now surgery remains the only reliable and effective treatment.  In this study, the investigators will examine the effect of high dose of Menaquinone-7 (MK-7) supplementation (1000 mcg)/day on the progression of the aortic valve disease. The investigators hypothesize that MK-7 supplementation may slow or even reverse the progression of the disease process.

Randomized Clinical Trial of Propofol, 1:1 and 4:1 Combination of Propofol and Ketamine for Procedural Sedation This will be a randomized trial of propofol versus the combination of propofol and ketamine for procedural sedation for procedures in the Emergency Department (ED). Propofol produces sedation, hypnosis, and dense amnesia, and is commonly used in the ED at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) for procedural sedation. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that is also frequently used in the ED in children and sometimes in adults. It has been proposed that by combining the two agents, the negative side effects of respiratory depression and hypotension associated with propofol, and the negative effects of dysphoria and vomiting associated with ketamine, can be avoided.  In the proposed study, patients seen in the ED who will require procedural sedation for a painful procedure will be randomized to receive either propofol or propofol and ketamine. During the procedure, patients will be monitored per the standard of care, including use of a cardiac monitor, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, pulse oximetry, nasal sample end-tidal carbon dioxide, and physician assessment. Once the procedure is successfully completed and the patient has returned to his/her baseline mental status, the patient will be asked to mark a 100 mm visual analog scale regarding perceived pain during the procedure, memory of the procedure, and overall satisfaction with the procedure.

Carbetocin at Elective Cesarean Deliveries: A Dose-finding Study in Women With BMI ≥ 40kg/m2 Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Carbetocin is a uterotonic with a superior pharmacokinetic profile to oxytocin. In a study performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, the investigators have shown that smaller doses of carbetocin (14.8 mcg) are as effective in achieving adequate uterine tone at elective cesarean section compared to the current recommended dose of 100mcg. However, this study was limited to those women with a body mass index (BMI) of \<40 kg/m2. Maternal obesity has been shown to increase the risks of hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony, therefore the investigators wish to perform a dose finding study to determine the ED90 of carbetocin at caesarean section in those women with a BMI\>40.

Routine Pregnancy Screening for Women on Opioid Substitution Therapy Women who take opioid substitution therapy have higher rates of unintended pregnancy, more pregnancies, and a higher risk of pregnancy complications than the general population. Current practice is to test for pregnancy only at patient request or if the clinician suspects pregnancy. This study will compare monthly pregnancy testing to current practice in a double blind randomized control trial. As many women of childbearing age as possible will be recruited from the Hamilton Clinic for Opioid Substitutional Therapy. Women assigned to the intervention will have monthly testing at the same time as their monthly urine drug testing at the clinic. The primary objective is to assess if there is a significant difference is early pregnancy detection and the secondary objectives are to assess differences in pregnancy disposition and gestational age at entry to prenatal or abortion care.
Hunger and Satiety in Anorexia Nervosa Anorexia means loss of appetite. But there is disagreement about whether the appetite is changed by the disease anorexia nervosa (AN). Appetite is a subjective essential sense, which is regulated in a complex ensemble between brain, stomach - intestinal system and hormones. As a direct result of malnutrition, there are many somatic complications caused by the disease AN. Several of these complications may in itself affect hunger- and satiety perception. An example of this is delayed gastric emptying. Furthermore, changes in the hormone systems affects the biological "reward system" in the brain, which plays an important role in appetite regulation. There is clearly need for research that could lead to better treatments for AN. Hunger- and satiety perception has only been studied in a few small cross-sectional studies with no clear conclusion.  The purpose of the study is to determine whether a visual analog scale measurement can detect changes in hunger- and satiety perception in a least 30 patients admitted to nutrition for life-threatening severe anorexia nervosa. It may lead to the first step in the development of a simple and inexpensive instrument which may prove to be useful in measuring the impact of new and ongoing treatments of the disease.

Functional Neuroanatomy of Emotion Perception, Recognition, Learning, and Memory This study uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the areas of the brain involved in different types of mental processes, in particular, the brain regions involved in perception, recognition, learning, and memory. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. In this study it is also used to measure blood flow in different regions of the brain while the subject is presented auditory or visual stimuli. The subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud noises that occur during the scanning process. Subjects are in the scanner no more than 2 hours.  Healthy, right-handed normal volunteers between 20 and 40 years of age who have at least a high school education may be eligible for this study.  While undergoing MRI, participants are presented visual stimuli (pictures or geometric shapes on a projection screen) or auditory stimuli (tones played through a set of headphones). Unpleasant stimuli such as loud noise, electric shocks, heat, or tactile stimuli are administered occasionally. The intensity of these stimuli is similar to those experienced in practice sessions before the scanning. Participants receive between 30 and 60 visual or auditory stimuli during the scanning session, and each stimulus lasts about 1 second. In some studies participants are asked to move a joystick that controls a rating bar presented on a projection screen to indicate when they expect to receive these stimuli and how sure they are that they will occur. Heart rate, respiration rate, and sweat gland activity are monitored during the MRI sessions, using electrodes placed on the fingers to measure heart rate and sweat gland activity and a sensor strapped around the chest to measure respiration. Subjects are in the scanner no more than 2 hours.  Following the experiment, subjects may be asked questions about their experiences during the study.
Hybrid Revascularization Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Patients with multivessel coronary disease have a compromised blood flow in the hearts own vessels, due to stenoses, and they are often treated with a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. This is a big heart operation where the sternum (breast plate) is split and the heart is once again given a sufficient blood flow, by redirecting blood to the compromised areas through grafts.  Another method for treating coronary disease is with percutaneous coronary intervention, or an endovascular approach that can re-establish blood flow to the hearts vessels by lessening the stenoses. However, bypass surgery is still the treatment of choice when there are multiple vessels in the heart with significant disease.  In this trial we want to examine if a less invasive approach, called hybrid revascularization, where we combine the best of both treatments is better than the current standard. The combination is a minimally invasive bypass surgery, called MIDCAB which makes a bypass graft through a key-hole surgery for the anterior vessel on the heart, and catheter treatment of all other vessels with significant stenoses. We will compare the hybrid revascularization with the conventional treatment with a full bypass surgery through a sternotomy.  Our hypothesis is that a less invasive revascularization strategy gives a better clinical outcome than the current standard with coronary artery bypass surgery through a split sternum.  To test our hypothesis we will conduct a multicenter randomized clinical trial.
Study on the Comparison Between"Standard Noodles" and Traditional Carbohydrates in the Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus. The object of this study is to compare "100g Standard Noodles " with traditional carbohydrates including 75g glucose solution in 300ml water and 100g steamed bread in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.  In this study, we will compare the different effects of "100g Standard Noodles Tolerance Test"and "75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test"on plasma glucose, insulin, c- peptide level and the relevant hormones level including glucagon-like peptide-1( GLP-1) and glucagon.

Safety and Immunogenicity of a First-in-Human Mosquito Saliva Peptide Vaccine Background:  Mosquitos carry diseases that cause major health problems and death worldwide. The AGS-v vaccine targets proteins in mosquito saliva. This may help prevent many mosquito-borne diseases. It might also reduce the lifespan of the mosquito that bites the vaccinated person.  Objective:  To see if the AGS-v vaccine is safe in humans and how it affects the immune system.  Eligibility:  Healthy adults ages 18-50  Design:  Participants will be screened another study.  Participants will be randomly assigned to get either the vaccine with a booster vaccine, the vaccine without the booster, or a placebo. These are given through a needle in the upper arm.  Participants will have visits that include medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests:  Baseline: They will get the vaccine and be monitored for 2 hours.  Follow-up visits 1 and 2 weeks after baseline.  Visit 3 weeks after baseline: They will get the booster and be monitored for 2 hours.  Follow-up visits 1 and 2 weeks after booster visit.  Visit 3-5 weeks after booster visit: This includes mosquito feeding. Mosquitos grown in the lab will be allowed to bite the arm. Blood will be drawn 4 times in the 3 hours after the feeding.  Phone follow-up a few days after the mosquito feeding.  After the feeding visit, 5 follow-up visits about every 2 months  Participants will keep a symptom diary for 7 days after each vaccine. They will record their temperature. They will measure any redness around the injection site. They will document and if possible photograph any mosquito bites they get.

Image-guided Proton Therapy for the Treatment of Locally Advanced Unresectable Head and Neck Cancer This phase I trial studies the side effects of image-guided hyper-fractioned proton therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Radiation therapy uses high energy protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. The change in dose radiation frequency and dose investigated in this study may help to better control the tumor and prevent it from coming back or growing. The goal of this study is to test a new radiation schedule that administers more radiation to the tumor tissue using image guided proton therapy for patients that have a high risk of having a tumor recurrence (the tumor comes back after treatment).
Investigation of the Influence of Gender on Cardiovascular Function Inflammation is a key initiating and damaging factor in many illnesses including infection, arthritis and cancer but also of particular relevance to this study in diseases of the heart and blood vessels (i.e. cardiovascular disease). Much evidence now exists demonstrating that male sex increases ones risk of cardiovascular disease. More recent evidence demonstrates that inflammatory responses in females appear to dampened in comparison to age matched males. Since inflammation is thought to be a key initiating phenomenon in many cardiovascular disease states the investigators will examine the differences in acute inflammatory responses between the sexes in healthy volunteers and the impact this has on the function of blood vessels.

Factors Influencing the Deterioration From Cognitive Decline of Normal Aging to Dementia Among Nursing Home Residents Background: A dearth of differential research exists regarding the determinants of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and moderate cognitive impairment or dementia among nursing home residents. This study aimed to identify and examine the association between medical factors (number of comorbidities, hospitalization, disability, depression, frailty and quality of life) and moderate cognitive impairment or dementia in nursing homes residents.  Methods: A cross-sectional design was used in this study. Convenience sampling of 182 participants was conducted in nursing homes located in the central part of Jordan. Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used to screen both MCI and moderate cognitive impairment or dementia. Bivariate analysis, including t-test and ANOVA test, and logistic and linear regression models were used to examine and identify the medical factors associated with moderate cognitive impairment or dementia compared to mild cognitive impairment.
Biomarkers for Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer Using Uterine Lavage Screening programs for high-grade ovarian carcinoma failed to reduce disease-specific mortality, since they do not offer early enough detection of the disease. Most cases of high grade ovarian cancer develop in the fallopian tubes, hence the universal recommendation for high-risk populations (e.g., BRCA1/2 mutation carriers) is to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) around the age of 40. The aims of this trial are: (1) to identify novel early-stage disease biomarkers using liquid biopsies obtained through uterine lavage, and (2) to optimize the technique a of uterine lavage and the processing of the samples for ultimate implementation as a routine diagnostic test for high risk populations.
Reliability of Consumer Sleep Trackers in Patients Suffering From Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome During last years, numerous sleep trackers have been commercialized. They are intended to give indications about sleep quality/duration in order to give people an internet-based feedback about their own sleep.  For clinical and research purposes, tri-axial accelerometers/multi-sensors devices are used routinely to assess objective sleep quality/patterns. Their use is also validated to estimate sleep in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA).  The purpose of the present study is to compare the accuracy of consumer-level sleep trackers and validated tools to measure sleep in OSA patients.

(Hypothesis 2) No significant differences will be seen for adverse events between the subjects taking Aquamin F, glucosamine sulfate, Aquamin F + glucosamine sulfate or placebo.
ER Reactivation Therapy for Breast Cancer Before anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen were developed to treat estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, high-dose estrogen therapies were used. This seems counterintuitive since anti-estrogens block ER function, while estrogens increase ER function, but these therapies are effective to similar extents for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Estrogen therapies are most effective against cancers that develop resistance to anti-estrogens, likely because such cancers have adapted to grow without ER function, and restoring ER function (with estrogen) is damaging to the cancer cells. In some patients with ER+ breast cancer that becomes resistant to anti-estrogens, treatment with the estrogen 17B-estradiol induces tumor response. Furthermore, when 17B-estradiol-sensitive tumors eventually become resistant to 17B-estradiol, switching back to anti-estrogen therapy is often effective. These observations suggest that cancers can alternate between anti-estrogen-sensitive and 17B-estradiol-sensitive states. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with alternating 17B-estradiol / anti-estrogen therapies on a defined 8-week / 16-week schedule will more effectively prevent cancer growth than continuous treatment with either type of therapy in patients with metastatic anti-estrogen-resistant ER+ breast cancer.
Safety and Effectiveness of VISULAS Green Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) An interventional, open, prospective, multi-center pre-market clinical investigation according to §§20-23a Medizinproduktegesetz (MPG, medical devices act), in which a total of 40 eyes of 40 consecutive patients at up to five (5) clinical sites will be enrolled, treated with the VISULAS green with option CSLT, and followed for a three months period.  The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of SLT with the VISULAS green laser with option CSLT.
A Blood Based Diagnostic Test for Coeliac Disease Persons with coeliac disease treated with a gluten free diet will be asked to give blood for a new diagnostic blood test. In this test investigators will use multimerized HLA bound to different gliadin-peptides (tetramer) and with the help of a flow-cytometer identify (along with other relevant T-cell-markers) gluten specific T-cells. Investigators believe that these cells will be present in persons with coeliac disease regardless of gluten-intake. Investigators will compare their findings with two control groups; Persons on a gluten free diet where celiac disease is excluded (gluten sensitive group) and persons on a gluten containing diet (healthy control group). In the initial and main study investigators will look at HLA DQ2.5 individuals, which comprise \>90% of all persons with coeliac disease.
Physical Exercise as an Additional Treatment for Alzheimer Disease The state of the art with regard to the neurodegenerative dementias, especially for Alzheimer´s disease (AD), is that their progression is still irreversible causing cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairment. Although the current pharmacological treatments attenuate cognitive decline in some cases, the majority of treatments does not avoid the motor and functional changes caused by the progress of the disease. Although several studies show that exercise has a positive effect when it comes to the treatment of the disease, some methodological questions affect the application of the training protocols. The use of recognized intensity patterns like maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximum heart rate (HRmax) percentage to control the training of patients with dementia is still rare in the literature. Therefore, this seems to interfere on the definition of an ideal prescription. Following this line of reasoning, the purpose of the present study is to assess the effect of moderate aerobic exercise on cognition and functional abilities in AD patients. Design: Randomized controlled trial, double-blinded, with 16-week follow-up. Setting: Center for Alzheimer's disease in the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Participants: Elderly with Alzheimer disease. Interventions: The patients will be randomly assigned to an exercise group (EG) on a treadmill (30 minutes, twice a week and moderate intensity of 60% VO2max) and a control group (CG). Main outcome measures: Cognitive function will be assessed using CAMCOG, Trail Making Test A, Digit Span, Stroop Test, Rey auditory-verbal learning test and Clock Test, and functional capacity will be evaluated using Berg Balance Scale (BERG), Sit-to-Stand test (STS), functional reach test (FR), and the time to up and go test (TUGT).
Biomarker-Driven Radiation Therapy Dose Reduction After Transoral Robotic Surgery for the Treatment of HPV-Positive Oropharyngeal Cancer This phase II trial tests whether reduced dose radiation therapy after transoral robotic surgery works in treating patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer. HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer has a better prognosis than oropharyngeal cancer not caused by HPV. A standard of care treatment for HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer is transoral robotic surgery followed by radiation therapy. However, this treatment is associated with many long-term side effects including difficulty swallowing. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving reduced dose radiation therapy after transoral robotic surgery may improve swallowing outcomes and quality of life compared to standard of care dose radiation therapy after transoral robotic surgery.
Efficacy of Hemostasis by Soft Coagulation Using Endoscopic Hemostatic Forceps for Acute Peptic Ulcer Bleeding Endoscopic high-frequency soft coagulation is available for the management of bleeding or nonbleeding visible vessels during endoscopic submucosal dissection.

Fenofibrate for Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Who Had An Inadequate Response to Ursodeoxycholic Acid Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been the only treatment for PBC approved by US and European drug administrations. Long-term use of UDCA(13-15 mg/kg/day) in patients with PBC improves serum liver biochemistries and survival free of liver transplantation However, about 40% of patients do not respond to UDCA optimally as assessed by known criteria for biochemical response. Those patients represent the group in need for additional therapies, having increased risk of disease progression and decreased survival free of liver transplantation. Both lab research and some clinical studies suggest that fenofibrate could improve cholestasis in multiple ways including reduce of bile acid synthesis, increase of biliary secretion and anti-inflammation effect. Here we start a random, open and parallel clinical research to explore the effect of fenofibrate in the PBC treatment.

Does the Implementation of Nurse-driven HIV Screening for Key Populations in the Emergency Departments Limit Undiagnosed Infections in the Paris Metropolitan Area? DEPIST Trial (ANRS 14055) In France, 40% of newly diagnosed HIV infections are concentrated in the Paris metropolitan area.  Two key populations are mainly concerned: persons born in a foreign country and men who have sex with men. The randomized trial ANRS DICI-VIH (2014-2015) showed that nurse-driven HIV screening for key populations, supported by research staff, in 8 emergency departments (EDs) of the region, was effective in addition to diagnostic testing. The strategy advocated by the WHO and the recent French recommendations support the proposal of screening for key populations in the EDs. Thus, it is important to evaluate the impact and the feasibility of the implementation of this strategy on a large scale.  The aim is to evaluate the impact of a wide implementation of nurse-driven HIV screening by rapid test in key populations combined with usual physician-directed diagnostic testing (intervention strategy) compared to diagnostic testing alone (control strategy) in the usual practice of the EDs.  The strategies will be compared during two periods in 18 EDs of Paris metropolitan area following a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.  During intervention period, nurses will suggest performing an HIV rapid test to patients belonging to key populations according to the answers to a self-administered questionnaire.

Effect of LIXIsenatide on the Renal System Based on preclinical and small-sized studies in non-diabetic individuals, incretin-based therapies, i.e. glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, may hold promise in preventing the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease. However, the potential renoprotective effects of these agents, that are believed to be effectuated "beyond glucose control", have not been sufficiently detailed in human diabetes.  Therefore, the present study aims to explore the mechanistic and clinical effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on renal physiology and biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes.  Forty patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes will undergo an eight week intervention with lixisenatide or insulin glulisine in order to assess changes in the outcome parameters.

Study on the Remote Diagnosis and Treatment Strategy of New-onset Insomnia Under the COVID-19 Epidemic Insomnia is a disorder characterized by both nocturnal and daytime symptoms. The main symptoms are unsatisfactory sleep quality or duration, accompanied by difficulty falling asleep before bedtime, frequent or prolonged awakenings, or an inability to fall back asleep after waking in the early morning. Our previous investigation has confirmed that during the period of home isolation of the epidemic, the community people suffered from acute insomnia induced by the epidemic. In order to comprehensively, efficiently and scientifically respond to major public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 epidemic and its long-term impact, it is necessary to carry out in-depth and systematic research on insomnia related issues of medical staff under the COVID-19 epidemic.  In summary, insomnia is a widespread problem among medical staff during the epidemic, which greatly reduces the work efficiency of medical staff and damages their physical and mental health. Without timely and effective early identification and effective intervention, allowing the disease to continue to develop will bring a series of concurrent diseases, threaten the lives of medical staff and bring a series of negative social effects. At the same time, the diagnosis and intervention of large-scale acute insomnia for medical staff under the epidemic face some scenario limitations, and it is necessary to consider the spread of the virus to reduce direct contact. Especially for some medical staff in isolation, it is more difficult to implement face-to-face evaluation, diagnosis and treatment. Under the COVID-19 pandemic, there are two main contradictions in the acute insomnia of medical staff. The first is the lack of a diagnostic cloud platform based on artificial intelligence for large-scale acute insomnia. The second is the lack of an effective remote intervention for acute insomnia suitable for the epidemic scenario.  Based on the results and deficiencies of the previous research, this project intends to further study and improve in three aspects. First, a large-scale and more accurate artificial intelligence-based automatic screening and diagnosis model research was carried out in combination with CPC equipment for acute insomnia screening of medical staff under the epidemic situation. The second is to use epidemic insomnia acute insomnia CPR to intervene the acute insomnia and other psychiatric symptoms of medical staff on a large scale and verify its effectiveness through follow-up. Third, for the epidemic scenario, further build an intelligent screening and remote intervention system platform for acute insomnia for the majority of medical staff, and continue to provide an assessment, intervention and consultation platform for medical staff under the epidemic.  Therefore, in order to comprehensively cope with the increase in the incidence of acute insomnia among medical staff under the COVID-19 epidemic and its resulting disease, social and economic burden, we should pay attention to the mental health of medical staff in the first-level key susceptible population, and improve the response experience of major public health emergencies in the future. This project aims to establish a portable and efficient artificial intelligent-based diagnosis cloud platform method and remote intervention system for medical staff with acute insomnia under the epidemic situation, which is suitable for large-scale development. Based on the data collected by portable devices and electronic scales, a risk assessment model for acute insomnia and other psychiatric symptoms of medical staff in the epidemic situation is constructed, and effective intervention is carried out on this basis. To promote the establishment of a comprehensive prevention and treatment system for insomnia after the epidemic, comprehensively carry out systematic work from multiple perspectives, improve mental health, summarize and form China's experience in dealing with major public emergencies, and promote it internationally, so as to reduce the impact and loss caused by the COVID-19 epidemic on a global scale.
Eltrombopag Plus Diacerein vs Eltrombopag in Adult ITP Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder with low platelet count. As the first choice of the second-line treatment of ITP, thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) enable long-term remission in 50% to 60% of cases. However, about half of patients have no response or loss of response to eltrombopag due to unknown reasons, which can't be effectively improved by increasing the drug dose. Diacerein is an anthraquinone derivative used to treat joint diseases such as osteoarthritis. We speculate that the addition of diacerein to eltrombopag may offer sensitizer effect and maximize efficacy, which warrants further prospective studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy as salvage strategy in ameliorating immune thrombocytopenia.
Mindfulness Meditation for Spine Surgery Pain The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation technique on post-operative pain of spine surgery subjects. Subjects will participate in a 6-week mindfulness meditation program, beginning two weeks prior to spine surgery.

The meditation intervention will be compared against a control group consisting of subjects that will undergo music therapy during the same period of time.
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to Optimize Post-Operative Recovery Pilot Psychological factors such as stress, distress, anxiety, depression, and poor coping strategies may be associated with ongoing pain following injuries such as fractures. To study this relationship, patients will undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) which is designed to modify such thoughts with the goal of reducing ongoing pain and improving quality of life. The goal of this study is to determine if CBT, versus usual care, reduces the prevalence of moderate to severe persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) over 12-months post-fracture
Impact of Mobile Health in Improving Lifestyle and Therapeutic Adherence in Coronary Heart Disease Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. In high-income countries, approximately seventy percent of cardiovascular diseases cases are attributable to modifiable risk factors, with metabolic risk factors (obesity, cholesterol) and tobacco use being the most closely associated.  Secondary prevention of coronary disease is considered essential, since it has contributed significantly to the reduction of morbidity and mortality, by facilitating the adoption and adherence to healthy behaviors, promoting an active lifestyle, and increasing adherence to pharmacological treatment.  Information and communication technologies have been increasingly incorporated into health care systems, including the innovative provision of Cardiac Rehabilitation through a mobile phone or m-health interventions. M-health technology can provide evidence-based guidance in an interactive format that is attractive, easy to use, and reduces healthcare costs.  The objective of this study is to evaluate, through a randomized controlled clinical trial, the effect of an intervention based on a web application of health, mobile Health, on lifestyle (diet, physical activity, and nicotine dependence) and therapeutic adherence in people with coronary heart disease.  The sample will consist of 200 participants, 100 in the intervention group and 100 in the usual care group that will be evaluated at the beginning and 3, 6, and 12 months after hospital discharge regarding sociodemographic, clinical, cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle, and therapeutic adherence characteristics. The educational intervention, monitoring, and self-monitoring will be carried out using a web-based m-Health tool, mobile phone application. The quantitative primary results will be compared between the two groups using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age and sex. Multivariate analysis will be carried out to examine the association of the intervention with life habits, control of cardiovascular risk factors as well as the evolution after discharge in respect of cardiovascular events, emergency and re-entry views.

Somatostatin in Polycystic Kidney: a Long-term Three Year Follow up Study Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal disease, responsible for 8% to 10% of the cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western countries. At comparable levels of blood pressure control and proteinuria, patients with ADPKD have faster decline in glomerular filtration rate than those with other renal diseases and do not seem to benefit to the same extent of ACE inhibitor therapy. A reasonable explanation for the above findings is that in ADPKD progression is largely dependent on the development and growth of cysts and secondary disruption of normal tissue. Thus, renoprotective interventions in ADPKD - in addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial blood pressure and proteinuria and to limit the effects of additional potential promoters of disease progression such as dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be specifically aimed to correct the dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and matrix interactions characteristic of the disease.  Evidence that specific receptors for somatostatin are present in the kidney tissue, arises the possibility that somatostatin treatment in patients with ADPKD might inhibit fluid formation and eventually induce the shrinking of renal cysts.To evaluate the tolerability and the safety of long-acting somatostatin in ADPKD patients, a prospective cross-over controlled study has been recently performed. This pilot study demonstrated the safety of six month treatment of long-acting somatostatin in patients with ADPKD. Moreover, the percent increase of total kidney volume was significantly lower in patients on somatostatin than in placebo. Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a long-term study in ADPKD patients aimed to document the efficacy of the somatostatin treatment in preventing further increase or even reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts, eventually halting kidney disease progression.

However, the benefits of this treatment are limited, and in most treated patients the disease continues to worsen.  SS1(dsFV)PE38 is a genetically engineered drug. It contains an antibody that binds to a certain protein on mesothelioma cells and a toxin (type of poison) made from a product of a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is hoped that the antibody will attach to the cancer cells, allowing the toxin to enter and kill the cells.  Objectives:  To find out if SS1(dsFV)PE38, together with pemetrexed and cisplatin is safe and tolerable in patients with mesothelioma.  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of SS1(dsFV)PE38 (the highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects).  To see if SS1(dsFV)PE38 given with pemetrexed and cisplatin has any effect on patients tumors.  To learn how the body breaks down SS1(dsFV)PE38.  Eligibility:  Patients 18 years of age and older with epithelial pleural mesothelioma whose disease cannot be cured with surgery, and have not had prior treatment with chemotherapy.  Design:  Treatment with pemetrexed, cisplatin and SS1(dsFV)PE38 in two 21-day cycles as follows:  * Day 1 - Intravenous (through a vein) infusions of pemetrexed and cisplatin. * Days 1 and 2 - Intravenous solution to prevent dehydration that might occur with SS1(dsFV)PE38. * Days 1, 3 and 5 Intravenous infusion of SS1(dsFV)PE38. Small groups (3 to 6) of patients are given SS1(dsFV)PE38 at a certain dose level. If the first group experiences no significant side effects, the next group a higher dose. This continues in succeeding groups until the maximum tolerated study dose (highest dose that patients can be given safely) is determined.  Continuing standard treatment with additional cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin.  Evaluations during the treatment period:  * Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant. * Questions about medications and side effects. * Blood and urine tests. * Disease evaluation with CT, chest X-ray, and possibly PET scans, lung function tests, pulse oximetry, performance of daily activities and quality-of-life questionnaires.  Post-treatment evaluations:  * Clinic visits at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18 and 21 for physical examination and disease assessment. * End-of-study visit for blood tests, vital signs and weight measurements, disease assessment, electrocardiogram, pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant

A Prospective Study of the Relevance of the HLA-G Immune Checkpoint in Cancer Immunotherapy Therapeutic targeting of immune checkpoints PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4 is efficient in several solid cancer subtypes, however only some patients do experience clinical benefit from these treatments. One explanation could be that multiple redundant checkpoints are present within the tumor, simultaneously keeping in check the patient's immune response. The immune checkpoint HLA-G is neo-expressed in over 50% of cases in some cancer subtypes and associated with more dismal prognosis. The immunosuppressive effects of HLA-G may result in resistance to current immunotherapy drugs.  The GEIA study explores the impact of HLA-G tumor expression on the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in solid cancer patients.
Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease Agitation affects 70 to 90 percent of patients with AD. Signs of agitation include verbal and physical aggressiveness, irritability, wandering, and restlessness. These behaviors often make caring for patients at home very difficult. Trazodone and haldol are two of the most commonly prescribed drugs for agitation in AD patients. Behavior management, a non drug approach, has been effective in reducing signs of agitation. Researchers have yet to compare the effectiveness of drug versus non drug therapy to treat agitation in AD patients and determine which is the best treatment. The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, with funding from the National Institute on Aging, is conducting an agitation treatment program at 21 sites in 16 States. This study will assess which of the above treatments is most effective.
Association Between the Support of NICU Team and Subjective Health of Parents Preterm birth is a traumatic event for parents. They cope with threatening and unfamiliar environment of hospital, losing the parental role, and frustration. The NICU team is the main support source for these parents. Support and providing information are most important for parents, as they can have some control, involvement and self confidence during the hospitalization, and also feel healthier. The hypothesis of this study is that better support to parents lead to better subjective health feeling by them.  The study will be held among mothers to infants in NICU who are at least 7 days old. The study will use a questionaire to assess the subjective health feeling and the estimation of the support from the team. Sample size is about 150 mothers.

Effects of the Additional Weight on the Reaching Behavior of Pre Term Infants With Low Birth Weight The effects of additional weight on early motor skills of infants have been increasingly studied. During the reaching behavior, the additional weight has been shown benefits in certain kinematic variables in full term and preterm infants. There is a growing interest in the study of populations at risk for motor development, especially considering interventions based on functional activities with the purpose of improving the neuromotor control, functional capacity and muscle strength. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of a functional training with additional weight in the reaching behavior of preterm infants with low birth weight and to compare the effects with a full term population. A controlled and randomized trial will be carried out with full term infants of adequate birth weight and preterm infants with low birth weight at 6 months of chronological or corrected age. The participants will be recruited by convenience from the charts of a Public Hospital. Participants will be randomly allocated into four groups: 1) adequate weight placebo group (AWPG); 2) adequate weight intervention group (AWIG); 2) low weight placebo group (LWPG) and 4) low weight intervention group (LWIG). . The assessor will be blinded (no knowledge of groups allocation). All infants will undergo a training program of eight sessions (2x/week; 4 weeks). The AWIG and LWIG will receive the training with an additional weight (characterized by a bracelet with a weight of 20% of the mass of the upper limbs)and the AWPG and LWPG will receive the same training, however, without the additional weight (only the bracelets).. All infants will be assessed in three different moments: 1) Pre-intervention: baseline, before the start of the intervention program; 2) Post-intervention: evaluation performed after the end of the program; and 3) Follow-up: evaluation performed seven days after the post-intervention assessment. The following kinematic dependent variables will be calculated: straightness index, mean velocity and motion units and electromyographic variables: pattern of activation and recruitment of muscle fibers - Biceps brachialis, Triceps brachialis, Deltoid and Pectoralis Major muscles; co-activation between biceps and triceps. The Qualisys Track Manager (QTM) and a wireless surface electromyography with 8-channels will be used. If normality assumptions are met, a mixed 2X2 ANOVA with repeated measures will be applied, in order to verify differences between the intervention programs, considering the dependent variables. Otherwise, non-parametric procedures of the same nature will be adopted. The significance will be set at 5% (P\<0.05).
Crestor Versus Placebo in Subjects With Heart Failure The purpose of the study is to investigate if rosuvastatin, added on top of all other medicines prescribed to subjects with symptomatic systolic heart failure, reduces the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (time to first event)
Analgesic Ear Drops for Children With Acute Otitis Media This trial aims to investigate whether analgesic ear drops added to usual care provide superior ear pain relief over usual care alone in children presenting to primary care with AOM. Children will be randomly allocated (ratio 1:1) to either 1) lidocaine hydrochloride 5mg/g ear drops (Otalgan) 1-2 drops up to six times daily for a maximum of 7 days in addition to usual care (oral analgesics, with/without antibiotics) or 2) usual care. Parents will complete a symptom diary for 4 weeks as well as generic and disease-specific quality of life questionnaires at baseline and 4 weeks. The primary outcome is the parent-reported ear pain score (0-10) over the first 3 days.  NOTE:  At the time of publication of the study protocol paper, the investigators were unable to make any amendments to the trial registration record in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR) (NL9500; date of registration: 28 May 2021). The addition of a data sharing plan was required to adhere to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines. The investigators therefore re-registered the trial in ClinicalTrials.gov. This second registration is for modification purposes only and the NTR record (NL9500) should be regarded as the primary trial registration.
CI-994 in Treating Patients With Advanced Myeloma RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.  PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CI-994 in treating patients who have advanced myeloma.
The Clinical Utility of Fecal Caprotectin and Lactoferrin in Patients Undergoing Capsular Endoscopy Capsule endoscopy (CE) is considered as a gold standard examination for small bowel Crohn's disease. However, it is time-consuming, expensive and results are largely influenced by the operator's skills. We, therefore, want to assess the predictive value of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in patients undergoing CE.
Integrated Model for Promoting Parenting and Early School Readiness in Pediatrics This study tests a comprehensive approach to the promotion of school readiness in low-income families, beginning shortly after the birth of the child, through enhancement of positive parenting practices (and when present, reduction of psychosocial stressors) within the pediatric primary care platform. The investigators do so by integrating two evidence-based interventions: 1) a universal primary prevention strategy (Video Interaction Project \[VIP\]); and 2) a targeted secondary/tertiary prevention strategy (Family Check-up \[FCU\]) for families with infants/toddlers identified as having additional risks. VIP provides parents with a developmental specialist who videotapes the parent and child and coaches the parent on effective parenting practices at each pediatric primary care visit. FCU is a home-based, family-centered intervention that utilizes an initial ecologically-focused assessment to promote motivation for parents to change child-rearing behaviors, with follow-up sessions on parenting and factors that compromise parenting quality.  Two primary care settings serving low-income communities in New York City, NY and Pittsburgh, PA will be utilized to test this integrated intervention in hospital-based clinics, providing information about translation across venues where one of the two interventions has been previously used alone.  The investigators plan to test the VIP/FCU model in a randomized trial of 400 families utilizing parent surveys, observational data on parent-child interactions, and direct assessments of children's development, at key points during intervention follow-up. Analyses will address questions of program impact for the integrated program across all families and by key subgroups.  The largest single contribution made by this study is to test whether an integrated primary and secondary/tertiary prevention strategy implemented in pediatric primary care can produce impacts on early school readiness outcomes, including social-emotional, pre-academic, and self-regulation. As such, this study has the potential to provide the scientific and practice communities with information about an innovative approach to promoting school readiness skills among low-income children.

Ultrasound-Guided Erector Spinae Plan Block for Colorectal Surgery Colorectal cancer is a common and lethal disease. It still remains the third most common cause of cancer death in women and the second leading cause of death in men. Pain control is an important direction of postoperative management in malignancy surgery. Inadequate pain control increases cardiac and respiratory complications in these critical patients. Erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a recently described regional anesthesia technique that blocks the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves and the sympathetic nerve fibers. While the ESP block has been shown to provide effective postoperative analgesia after thoracic, and abdominal surgeries.  Our aim in this study was to investigate bilateral thoracic ESP block for providing successful postoperative pain management following colorectal surgery.

Effectiveness of a Self-guided Mobile Phone Application in Improving the Way we See Ourselves and Our Bodies Body image concerns are pervasive and can impact multiple aspects of a person's life. Individuals with negative body image tend to have negative thoughts and feelings about their bodies, often resulting in unhealthy behaviours. Negative body image is also associated with mental and physical health conditions. Thus, prevention efforts are crucial to alleviating body image concerns in young adults as they are considered high-risk populations.  This study is a randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided body image program on a mobile-based application for young adults.  Hypothesis 1a: The intervention group will improve significantly on measures of body image at post-intervention and follow-up, as compared to the control group.  Hypothesis 1b: The intervention group will reduce significantly on measures of appearance-ideal internalization, media and peer pressures at post-intervention and follow-up, as compared to the control group.  Hypothesis 2: The intervention group will improve significantly on the measure of self-compassion at post intervention and follow-up, as compared to the control group.
Lactate Use as Triage Tool in Sepsis : Veinous, Capillary or Arterial? Severe sepsis and septic shocks are increasingly codified. A biomarker as Lactate is very interesting to detect those situations. Usually, lactate used is arterial but results are often too slow to obtain if we want to respect Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Some analyzers (EKF diagnostics Lactate Scout\*) can give results in 15 seconds.  We hypothesized that capillary lactate, easy to sample, tested with this analyzer may detect earlier those infections states and we want to find the most accurate site to detect severe sepsis (capillary, venous or arterial sample).

Open-label Pilot Evaluating Renal Lesions w/ Contrast-enhaced US in Patients w/ Renal Cancer This prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound when used to evaluate renal lesions in two different populations; patients with known renal tumors (Cohort 1) and patients with a risk factor for renal malignancy in whom their screening ultrasound shows an indeterminate or possibly malignant renal mass (Cohort 2).
Urgent vs. Early Endoscopy in High Risk Patients With Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is one of the commonest medical emergencies. The condition accounts for 150 per 100,000 populations. A National United Kingdom reported a crude overall mortality rate of 10%. While bleeding stops spontaneously in majority of patients at their presentation, there remains a subgroup of patients who continue to bleed or develop recurrent bleeding. In these patients, the mortality increases manifolds. If these high-risk patients can be identified, early interventions may improve their outcomes.  Several prognostic indices are in use for the purpose of patient stratification. They include the Rockall, Glasgow-Blatchford (GBS) and the Baylor scores. The Rockall score is a composite score which incorporates clinical parameters as well as findings during endoscopy which was derived to predict mortality. The GBS is a pre-endoscopy or a clinical score for the prediction for the need of further intervention loosely defined as the need for transfusion, endoscopy or surgery. It has been shown to be accurate in identifying low risk patients for early discharge.
Bridging Resources Improve the Development of Guideline-based Exercise The purpose of this pilot study is to more effectively deliver the current standard of care for obesity and physical activity based on current guidelines. The investigators plan to gather preliminary data on physician-directed Intensive Behavioral Therapy for Obesity (IBT-O) utilizing CardioCoachCO2 by KORR technology to measure oxygen consumption both at rest and during exercise to assess resting metabolic rate (RMR) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) respectively. RMR and CRF will be incorporated into an exercise prescription through implementation of the CardioCoach VO2 Max App as part of a multi-level physical activity intervention to improve CRF and decrease obesity by acting on multiple levels of the socio-ecological model in a primary care setting.

Decreasing Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting in the Bariatric Surgical Patient From the research and current studies, post-operative nausea and vomiting is a common complaint after bariatric surgery. Nausea relief inhalers could improve post-operative nausea and vomiting without the need for further medications, subsequently reducing the chance of side effects. This study could help improve patient satisfaction and increase the ability of the patient to ambulate after surgery with the use of a nausea relief inhaler.
Technology Enhanced Family Treatment The investigators propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence-based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC "real time" assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. The investigators hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.
SAFE at Home: A Service to Provide Social Engagement to Community-Dwelling Persons With Dementia The proposed Phase 1 study will involve initial development and evaluation of a new service called Social Activities For Engagement at Home or SAFE at Home (SaH). SaH will enable PWD to participate in videoconference-based group activities with their peers-i.e., other PWD. SaH sessions will be facilitated by highly trained "Engagement Professionals," who will be SaH staff members that have a background in recreation therapy, activity coordination, or a similar field. The proposed study has three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop an Alpha version of the SaH app, including app infrastructure and preliminary activity content for live group sessions, as well as staff training and coaching modules. Aim 2. Examine the app's acceptability/feasibility (by assessing attendance, session length, and engagement/affect). Aim 3. Examine satisfaction with the app by directly eliciting feedback from PWD and life enrichment staff.
Combination Daclizumab/Denileukin Diftitox to Treat Uveitis This study will determine whether treatment with a combination of the drugs daclizumab and denileukin diftitox can eliminate the need for long-term daclizumab treatment in adult patients with uveitis. Denileukin diftitox kills white blood cells called lymphocytes that cause inflammation and may be the cause of uveitis.  Patients 18 years of age and older with uveitis in one or both eyes who are on daclizumab therapy and have not had a disease flareup in 6 months may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, eye examination (including vision test, examination of the front of the eye, and pupil dilation for examination of the retina at the back of the eye), blood tests and a questionnaire about their vision and daily activities.  After screening, participants undergo the following procedures:  * Daclizumab/ denileukin diftitox treatment. Patients receive their regular dose of daclizumab intravenously (through a vein). The interval between doses is increased by 1 week after each dose. When the doses are 10 weeks apart, the daclizumab is stopped. Patients who experience a flare or uveitis are treated with intravenous denileukin diftitox and possibly local injections of steroids around the eye or increasing or adding other medicines as needed to control the uveitis. * Fluorescein angiography to look for blood vessel abnormalities in the eyes. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina (the back portion of the eye) are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible abnormalities. * Ultrasound and urine tests at enrollment and after 1 year to check kidneys, lymph nodes and pelvic area. * Blood tests at enrollment and every 3-6 months for laboratory and immunology tests and other research tests on blood cells to examine the immune response. * Follow-up visits approximately every 6 weeks for 2 years for repeat examinations to determine the response to treatment and drug side effects.

Combination Chemotherapy and Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation in Treating Patients With Neuroblastoma RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying peripheral stem cell transplantation with treated peripheral stem cells following combination chemotherapy to see how well it works compared to peripheral stem cell transplantation with untreated peripheral stem cells following combination chemotherapy in treating patients with neuroblastoma.
Pain Experience in Individuals With Chronic Low Back Pain Low back pain is a very common musculoskeletal condition that affects many people each year regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity. Most people get better however, some continue suffering from painful episodes despite treatment.  Self-management strategies for the management of chronic low back pain are very important to patients as they help them develop skills to manage their pain more effectively. However, self-management strategies are not always effective as expected. It is possible that the brain has become very sensitive to signals coming from peripheral parts of the body (e.g. low back) affecting the ability of patients to self-manage their condition.  The aim of this study is to establish whether central sensitisation (sensitivity of the brain to peripheral signals) predicts how effective self-management approaches will be.  On three different occasions, scheduled sessions will include a clinical assessment session and completion of a questionnaire booklet. The clinical assessment will measure three features of central sensitisation: 1) sensitivity to blunt pressure on the forearm, 2) changes in pain, felt during repeated light pricking of the forearm skin, and 3) reduction in pain that accompanies inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the opposite arm. Participant involvement at each session is expected to last for 70 minutes.  Individuals over 18, diagnosed with chronic low back pain and enlisted to follow a pain management program are eligible to participate. The clinical assessments, questionnaire completion and subsequent statistical analysis are expected to be completed within 18 months of study commencement.  Based on our findings, future research may use similar clinical assessment to identify people who might be helped to self-manage by using treatment that reduces central sensitisation.
Detection of Periapical Lesions on Dental Panoramic Radiographs Based on Artificial Intelligence Dental periapical damages can have various reasons and is reflected by a radiolucent lesion on complementary imaging: angulated retro-alveolar (RA) radiographs, dental panoramic radiographs, and three-dimensional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).  For the radiographic detection of these deep periodontal lesions, the dental panoramic represents a first approach commonly performed with relatively low radiation. The investigation can be followed by retroalveolar radiology imaging that are more localized and more precise. However, using these techniques, the detection rates of these lesions are low (20% and 36% respectively), it is necessary to use three-dimensional tomographic investigation to be more discriminating (69%). The gold standard imaging for detection of these lesions is CBCT followed by retroalveolar radiography (\~2x less sensitive than CBCT) and panoramic radiography (\~2x less sensitive than RA). Although not a full-thickness radiograph, the dental panoramic has the advantage of being more commonly performed while being less radiating than CBCT and giving a global view of the dental arches on a single image.  The detection of periapical lesions is done after a clinical assessment and a visual appreciation of the complementary examinations.  The aim of this project is to improve the detection of periapical lesions, by developing an algorithm able to identify them on a panoramic dental radiograph. This algorithm is based on a deep learning system trained with reference data including panoramic dental imaging and CBCT with an acquisition interval of less than 3 months. The model is based on a previous work, will improve the quality of the initial data (using CBCT), using innovative artificial intelligence algorithms (transfer learning).

Using Web-based Technology to Expand and Enhance Applied Behavioral Analysis Programs for Children With Autism in Military Families The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which technology may be used to provide (a) state-of-the-art assessment and intervention for children diagnosed with autism and (b) parent and tutor training for those who care for these children.  Children with autism often have problems with social interaction, language, and repetitive behavior (e.g., hand flapping and body rocking). Without early and intensive treatments, the long-term outcomes for children with autism are not very good; therefore, it is very important that effective treatments are started as soon as possible. Research has shown that Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions (EIBI) is an effective treatment for autism. Although EIBI is effective, most children with autism in military families do not receive EIBI because there are few professionals and paraprofessionals that are appropriately trained to do this, especially in the remote areas where military families tend to serve. The investigators want to show that web-based technologies (e.g., web-cams and internet-protocol cameras) can be used so that professionals in one place can treat children with autism anywhere in the world. The investigators also expect that providing these services will help children with autism improve their language, social, and academic skills. The investigators expect that the gains made by the children will help relieve many daily stressors and worries that families with children with autism have.  Children with autism who lack adaptive skills require constant help and supervision from parents. Thus, the improvements in the child's functioning will allow the child to become more independent and decrease parent stress associated with the need to constantly watch and help the child. Because EIBI services produce lasting improvements long after the intervention has ended, this project will provide both short-term and long-term benefits to the children who participate in the study, which will provide lasting relief to these dedicated military families.  In the long-term, this project may really change the way in which all (military and non-military) children and families get effective services that they cannot get now. Also, the results may help other professionals and researchers in psychology and medicine. That is, the results should be helpful to any kind of service that uses parent training and paraprofessionals. Most importantly, these services will improve the overall functioning of the children with autism and decrease the overall stress on these families as they continue to serve our country.
Effects of Whole Body Vibration Training on Unstable Surface After an initial ankle sprain, Chronic Ankle Instability is one of the most common residual symptoms which include pain, swelling, recurrent sprain, episodes of ankle joint "giving away" or decreased function. Recently, Whole Body Vibration (WBV) training has been introduced as a preventive and rehabilitative tool. It can be hypothesized that WBV on unstable surfaces might enhance neuromuscular control. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 6-week WBV training on an unstable surface on body composition, balance, strength and reflex and muscle activity of ankle muscles in recreational athletes with CAI.
Automated Sperm Sample Preparation Protocol This clinical trial would be directed at determining the effectiveness of an innovative sperm sample preparation protocol for intrauterine insemination (IUI).

A Phase III Randomized Trial of the Reduction of Chemotherapy in Philadelphia Chromosome-positive ALL of Young Adults The Primary objective is to assess the non-inferiority of the experimental arm (arm B) compared to the control arm (arm A) in terms of Major Molecular Response (MMolR) after the 4th cycle (MRD4) in patients aged 18-59 years old with de novo Philadelphia positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
Safety of Cold Snare Polypectomy in Patients With Uninterrupted Antiplatelet Agent Polypectomy is regarded as high risk for bleeding. Several guidelines recommend continuous use of aspirin during polypectomy. However for clopidogrel, widely used antiplatelet agent, cessation of 5-7 is recommended. There is insufficient data regarding clopidogrel on post polypectomy bleeding. Delayed bleeding after polypectomy in patients with clopidogrel was reported as 3%. A recent study showed that delayed bleeding rate in patients with clopidogrel didn't differ that of who stopped clopidogrel. However the rate for delayed bleeding was 4%, higher than the previous studies. More studies are needed to conclude the safety of polypectomy in clopidogrel users.  Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) can resect polyps without electrical energy. CSP are safe than conventional endoscopic mucosal resection in high risk for bleeding.  The polypectomy techniques in most of studies were heterogenous, where delayed bleeding was investigated in clopidogrel users. There is no study to investigate safety of CSP in patients with clopidogrel users to date. The investigators hypothesized that the bleeding risk of CSP in patients with clopidogrel users would be similar to that of aspirin users.  In this multicenter prospective study, the investigators aimed to compare the safety of CSP between aspirin and clopidogrel users.
ACUTE-Acute Surgical Care- Risk Factors and Outcomes for Patients in Need of Acute Surgical Care Observational retrospective study of patients in need of acute surgical care admitted to Skåne University Hospital between 2009 and 2019.
Can Video Clips Improve Patient Comprehension at the Emergency Department? The aim of this study is to assess the utility of two interventional videos, showed to patients discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or deep vein thrombosis. We have focused our attention on these two medical conditions because they share some important features: they are frequently seen in EDs; their main complication (stroke and pulmonary embolism) can cause significant morbidity and mortality; both conditions and their related complications are probably not very intuitive to comprehend for the general population. In fact, the understanding of these conditions implies the knowledge of a number of pathological processes, with which most people are unfamiliar.  The primary hypothesis is that patients enrolled in the study group will show a higher degree of comprehension of their medical condition and its related complications, as compared to the control group. Secondly, we will also analyze any possible effect of the videos on the knowledge of the therapy prescribed, return instructions and patients' satisfaction with the quality of communication in the ED.  Eventually, we will examine the association of some factors with the outcomes (age, sex, level of education, atrial fibrillation vs. deep vein thrombosis group).
Genetics of COVID-19 Susceptibility and Manifestations Background:  Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health problem, and genetics may play a role in how serious the illness becomes in certain people. Genes are the instructions that our body uses to grow and develop. Variations in our genes can cause medical conditions and may be the reason why some people get sicker than others.  Objective:  This study aims to learn more about the genetic contributions to the severity of COVID-19. We hope to use this information to develop therapies that reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in some people.  Eligibility:  Anyone located in the United States who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be eligible to join (including NIH staff).  Design:  Participants will complete a questionnaire about their health history and COVID-19 symptoms.  Participants will give a blood or saliva sample. It will be about 2 tablespoons of blood, or we will send a saliva collection kit. Researchers will use this blood or saliva sample to study the participant s DNA.  The data about participants genes will be stored in a large database. The database will be shared with other qualified researchers who are trying to learn about COVID-19. Participants names and other personal details will not be shared. Instead, the data will be labeled with a code.  Participants may be contacted by study team members for up to a year after they join the study.
Mucosal Injury Using Pharyngeal Packing After approval of the Institutional Review Board and written patient´s informed consent patients with indication for surgery of the sinuses were randomly assigned to one of the two study groups. After standardized anaesthetic management and PONV prophylaxis routinely applied the patients were screened for mucosal injury on second postoperative day. Furthermore, the amount of analgetic and anti-emetic drugs and the severity of pain and PONV were recorded throughout the hospital stay.
The Effects of Dietary Intake of Cod Residual Material Meal on Lipid Regulation, Glucose Regulation and Body Composition in Physically Active Adults A high intake of fish is associated with positive health effects, including prevention and treatment of chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and type 2 diabetes. These health effects have traditionally been attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids in fatty fish, but recent studies have suggested that also fish proteins may improve biomarkers of metabolic disease. Intake of cod fillet have previously shown beneficial effects on blood lipids, glucose regulation and body composition in adults with overweight or obesity. Health effect of cod residual material from fillet production (i.e., head, backbone, skin, cutoffs and entrails) have so far not been investigated, but residuals from other fish species have shown promising effects on glucose regulation in rats. The main aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of cod residual meal on serum lipids and glucose regulation in healthy, physically active adults.
Training for Transfer by Contextual Variation The goal of this randomized study is to investigate the effect of introducing contextual variation on transfer when learning a technical skill in a group of medical students. The main questions it aims to answer is: If context variation of specific affordance conditions enhance the learner's ability to transfer out? Participants will practice performing an invasive ultrasound guided procedure either on a fantom with maximum affordances or with contextual variation. Researchers will compare the maximum affordances group and the contextual variation group to see if its effects compared to the control group with minimal affordances.
A Study Of The Effectiveness And Safety Of A 36-Week Refill Regimen For The Port Delivery System With Ranibizumab Vs Aflibercept Treat & Extend In Subjects With Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a 36-week refill regimen for the Port Delivery System with ranibizumab 100 mg/mL (PDS Q36W) compared with intravitreal injections of aflibercept (2 mg) administered per treat-and-extend (aflibercept T\&E) in subjects with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).
WashIn /WashOut Procedure To Prevent Agitation During Recovery After Inhalational Anesthesia With Sevoflurane Inhalation anesthesia is the most frequently used technique and is performed in around 70% of surgeries worldwide. Sevoflurane is the most frequently used halogenated anesthetic and is used in 2/3 of the cases.  The anesthetic strength of inhalation agents was established in the classic work of Eger and colleagues who determined the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of an inhaled anesthetic at atmospheric pressure, necessary to prevent a motor reaction in response to a pain stimulus in 50% of patients.  Agitation is a frequent anesthesia complications and it not only lengthens the period of post anesthetic awakening and need for advance monitoring of the patient, but may be a predisposing factor in the development of postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) which are independent predictors of increased mortality, prolonged treatment in the ICU and hospital, and prolonged social adaptation of the operated patients.(The ability of the patient to serve themselves independently.).  There is a fairly popular point of view that there is no specific prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative agitation.  However, a variant of anesthesia induction with sevoflurane was recently proposed, which reduced the frequency of agitation in children from 24.7% to 4.4%. The technique consisted in interrupting anesthesia at the moment of loss of consciousness, awakening the patient and subsequently performing re-induction. Since this technique might be time consuming in the busiest period of a surgical theatre and not safe if performed with the airways still unsecured it is advisable to shift the Wash In/Wash Out procedure to the stage of awakening at the end of surgery.
Functional Outcome Measures for Head and Neck Patients The objective of this study is to identify outcome measures for cancer control in Head and Neck cancer patient populations at the University of Pennsylvania (HUP, PAH, Presby) by administering various functional outcome surveys and questionnaires about their reconstructive surgery. We hope to ultimately develop a QOL indicator that will reflect the impact of reconstructive surgery on patient's quality of life, and help with therapeutic interventions and explanation of expectations prior to surgery.

Assessment of Kidney Function and Osteomuscular Status After Critical Care This observational study aims to assess kidney function through direct glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using iohexol clearance, compared to estimated GFR based on creatinine and cystatin C equations. Kidney function will also be evaluated through renal fibrosis biomarkers. Kidney function will be correlated to body composition, muscle turnover biomarkers, and bone micro-architecture.
One-4-ALL Initiative This study aims to improve health outcomes of individuals and populations, enhance the patient experience, reduce the per capita cost of care, and ensure the well-being of our healthcare providers (quadruple aim). These goals are increasingly difficult to achieve, given the challenges of changes to workflow, staffing shortages, and increased costs brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the pandemic brought to light the critical need to transform healthcare access for our racially and culturally minoritized and low-income families that have long been victims of health disparities, specifically with poorer health outcomes.

Spinal Cord Innovation in Pediatrics (SCiP) to Treat SensoriMotor Function in Children Cerebral Palsy: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial Cerebral palsy affects up to 4 children in 1000 live births, making it the most common motor disorder in children. It impairs the child's ability to move voluntarily and maintain balance and posture, and resultsing in a wide range of other functional disorders during early development that persist and frequently worsen with age including spasticity and often multiple abnormal sensationsensory modalities. Current standard of care treatments focus on symptom management and do not mitigate the progression of many of these underlying neurological impairments. The goal of this trial is to conduct a prospective multicenter, double-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover, randomized control trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of noninvasive spinal cord stimulation (using SCiPTM device, SpineX Inc.) in conjunction with activity-based neurorehabilitation therapy (ABNT) to improve voluntary sensorimotor function in children with cerebral palsy. 44 children participants (aged 2-18 years) diagnosed with CP classified as Gross Motor Function Classification Scale Levels I-V will be recruited and divided equally into two groups (G1 and G2). Both groups will receive identical ABNT 2 days/wk. G1 will initially receive sham stimulation, whereas G2 will receive therapeutic SCiPTM therapy for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, G1 will cross over and receive therapeutic SCiPTM therapy for 8 weeks, whereas G2 will continue to receive SCiPTM therapy for another 8 weeks, for a total of 16 weeks. Primary and secondary outcome measures will include Gross Motor Function Measure-88 and Modified Ashworth Scale respectively.
A Study to Compare Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of GP-40081 to NovoMix® 30 Penfill® in Healthy Subjects Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics study of 2 formulations of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (GP-40081 GEROPHARM vers. NovoMix® 30 Penfill® Novo Nordisk)
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Chronic Subjective Tinnitus Therapy of subjective chronic primary tinnitus could be challenging. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is currently being tested for suppressing the symptoms. However, effect of stimulation remains controversial. The aim was to uncover real effect of rTMS stimulation for tinnitus treatment. There will be three groups, stimulation group, sham stimulation group and controlled group with medicament treatment. The investigators assume that combination of rTMS stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and primary auditory cortex at both sides will be more efficient. The investigators considered a 10% improvement in the tinnitus questionnaire score and in the tinnitus masking to be clinically relevant.
Prospective Subtalar, Double, or Triple Arthrodesis Study With CCS Screws The objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the mid-term results and intraoperative and postoperative complication rate in patients who underwent double or triple arthrodesis using CCS screws.
Passive Mobilisation of Region of Shoulder Joints for Hemiplegic Patient Hemiplegia is a high prevalence pathology with 1 per 1000 habitants in France. One of these complications is shoulder pain which affects about 35 to 70% of cases. The medical care of this complication is critical because it affects the patient's quality of life and also hinders participation in rehabilitation sessions slowing the recovery of independence in activities of daily living.  Literature confirmed the involvement of the scapula in the hemiplegic shoulder pain with his attitude pronounced lateral rotation. But no data to confirm that passive mobilization reduce shoulder pain.  Because no data available to permit us to determine the sample size we set-up this preliminary study to check if efficiency found in these preliminary data are consistent with an estimable real efficacy in a randomized trial feasible.
Effectiveness of the Serious Video Game MOON in Emotional Regulation in ADHD Introduction: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood and adolescence (5%) with associated difficulties and worse prognosis if undetected. Multimodal treatment is the treatment of choice, however, sometimes it can be insufficient or have some drawbacks.  Objective: To demonstrate the effectiveness of cognitive training through the video game 'The Secret Trail of Moon' (MOON) in improving emotional regulation of ADHD in people aged 7 to 18 years.  Hypotheses: H1: ADHD patients using MOON improve their emotional regulation more than the control group; H2: ADHD patients using MOON improve in symptomatology with respect to the control group; H3: ADHD patients using MOON improve their cognitive abilities than the control group; H4: ADHD patients using MOON improve in academic performance with respect to the control group; H5: The change of platform (face-to-face, online) does not entail differences in emotional regulation; H6: There are no side effects associated with the video game.  Methods: Design: prospective, unicenter, randomized, unblinded, PRE-POST intervention study. Randomization of the groups (MOON vs. Control) will be performed by electronic CRD. The MOON intervention will be performed 2 times/week for 10 weeks (30 minutes/session). The first five weeks (10 sessions) will be conducted face-to-face; the remaining weeks will be conducted online at the participants' home.  Sample: 152 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (CGI between 3 and 6) with pharmacological treatment.  Evaluation: a data collection notebook will be used to obtain demographic and clinical data. The data will be recorded with electronic CRD (REDCap). Measures to answer the hypotheses will be made through clinical scales for parents and objective tests of cognitive abilities in patients. Additional information on academic performance will be collected.  Statistical power analysis: The study has a power greater than 80% to detect differences.  Statistical analysis: Classical statistics: T student, 2-factor ANOVA and Mann Whitney analyses will be performed according to the characteristics of each variable.  Ethics: The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro on December 14th, 2022. The authorization of the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Health Products was February 14th, 2023. Informed consent will be requested from legal guardians and minors protecting their personal data to the provisions of the Organic Law 3/2018 of 5 December, on Personal Data Protection and guarantee of digital rights.

Study Assessing Safety, Immunogenicity and LDLc -Lowering Activity of 2 PCSK9 Targeting AFFITOPE Vaccines in Healthy Subjects Study AFF012 is a single blind, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase I clinical trial of repeated administration by subcutaneous injection of a single dose of one of two different proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 targeting AFFITOPE® vaccines or Placebo. This study will assess Safety, Immunogenicity and low density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering activity of the two vaccines.  72 healthy subjects are divided into three test groups (2 treatment groups, 1 placebo group), each consisting of 24 subjects. The subjects are randomized to receive either of two AFFITOPEs® (AT04A or AT06A, adsorbed to 1 mg aluminium oxyhydroxide) or placebo (1 mg aluminium oxyhydroxide).  The study consists of 3 parts, part A, encompassing Visit 1 to Visit 8, covering 3 priming immunizations at a dose of 15μg at days 0, 28 and 56 and the immediate observation period extending to day 140; the prolonged observation period: part B, encompassing Visit 9 and Visit 10 at days 273 and 365; and part C consisting of 7 visits (V11 to V17). Study participants having received 3 priming vaccinations and having completed part B will receive in part C one boost immunization at a dose of 75μg, which will be applied one year after the 3rd immunization (day 420). Probands will proceed directly from part A to part B and to part C. Continuation of parts B and C will be considered based on the part A results, primarily the immunological results. The following scenarios apply (provided that there is no safety issue). None of the two treatment groups exhibits a vaccine-specific antibody response over the placebo group at Visit 8 - this will lead to termination of the trial. One of the two groups fails to exhibit a vaccine-specific antibody response over the placebo group at Visit 8 - this will lead to its discontinuation; the other treatment group and the placebo group will be continued.
Vital Root-resective Therapy in Furcation-involved Maxillary Molars The primary aim of this study is to evaluate 1-year survival of maxillary molars with subclass C vertical furcation involvement after vital root resective therapy
BP Variability on the Outcomes of Hemodialysis Vascular Access Hemodialysis vascular access dysfunction continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with ESRD. Thrombosis is the most common cause of secondary vascular access failure Although intimal hyperplasia at the outflow vein is the most common cause of thrombosis, 20-40% of thrombosis may develop secondary without underlying anatomic abnormalities. Low-flow states secondary to low BP have been proposed to precipitate access thrombosis. In previous studies, lower pre- and post- dialysis SBP are associated with a higher rate of access thrombosis. Nonetheless, high blood pressure is also a well-known risk factor for arteriosclerosis, intimal hyperplasia, and thrombotic vascular events. In dialysis patients, the relation between blood pressure and thrombosis seems to be more complex, and few studies have delineated the effect of blood pressure in a systematic manner.  In addition to the static component of blood pressure, blood pressure variability (BPV) is increasingly accepted as a novel risk factors for vascular disease. BPV is categorized as either long or short term. In dialysis patients, long-term BPV is typically defined on the basis of BP measurements taken at the start of hemodialysis (inter-dialysis BPV); short-term BPV is usually considered in terms of variability during hemodialysis (intra-dialysis BPV). BP variability is increased in ESRD patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, only one study by Cheung et al focused on intra-dialytic BPV, which found intradialytic hypotension to be a risk factor for access thrombosis. Nonetheless, access thrombotic events rarely occur during the dialysis session. It remained unclear that if inter-dialysis BPV is a more relevant factor for access thrombosis. Answer to this question is of clinical significance because the optimal BP target after PTA remained unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of BP variability on the outcomes of hemodialysis vascular access, major cardiovascular events in maintenance hemodialysis patients. We also aimed to evaluate the determinants of BPV in hemodialysis patients, including medication, frailty, fluid status and autonomic function. The impact of autonomic function and frailty on the outcomes of vascular access and cardiovascular events will be evaluated as well.
Comparison Between Low-level Laser Therapy, Intracanal Cryotherapy and Their Combination, on Post-endodontic Pain Level Statement of the problem: Postoperative pain following endodontic treatment is a common complication that might require analgesics for pain relief. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and Intracanal Cryotherapy (ICCT) are both recommended as non-pharmacological and non-invasive treatment modalities for management of painful situations. Aim of the study: This study is conducted to clinically evaluate and compare the effect of both LLLT and ICCT on post-endodontic pain (PEP) over 5 days in molars with symptomatic apical periodontitis (SAP) using visual analog scale (VAS). Materials \& Methods: This parallel arm, randomized clinical trial will involve 95 systemically free patients with SAP in molars. The patients will be randomly allocated to 5 equal groups as follows: control (no intervention), placebo (mock laser therapy), LLLT, ICCT and a combination of both. Postoperative pain levels after 6 hrs, 12 hrs, on 2nd day and 5th day are going to be assessed on the VAS and shall be noted. Data collected will be tabulated and statistically analysed.
Comfort Talk for Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization Background: Pre anaesthesia anxiety in children is a strong predictor of postoperative behavior challenges and outcomes. In addition, intra-operative stress can precipitate post-traumatic stress symptomatology. Comfort Talk, consisting of rapport, relaxation, and reframing of potentially stressful experiences, applied pre-operatively in script form, has been highly successful in alleviating anxiety and positively affecting procedural outcomes in adult patients undergoing interventional procedures. No published literature exists evaluating its' impact in paediatric cardiac catheterization. Purpose: To investigate the impact of comfort talk on the level of pre-induction anxiety, procedural and recovery experience, as well as short-term post-procedural behaviour and satisfaction after discharge in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization procedures. Design: Prospective randomized, double blind controlled trial. Participants: 160 children, ages 7-18 years, having a cardiac catheterization procedure under general anaesthesia. Intervention: Group A will be read a pre-procedure comfort talk script in the pre-procedure work-up area; Group B will be read a pre-extubation (before the breathing tube is removed) script ; Group C will be read a pre-procedure plus a pre-extubation script; Group D will not be read any script. All groups will be treated according to the standard of care approaches usually provided for anaesthesia, catheterization, and recovery. Outcomes: We will compare the effect of the script strategy on preoperative anxiety. Procedural and recovery measurements will include room time in the catheterization suite, time to discharge from the recovery room; drug use, vomiting, rebleeds, and cardiorespiratory stability. Postoperative behaviour will be assessed by questionnaire. Postoperative anxiety and pain will be secondary outcome measures using queries on 0-10 verbal self-report scales Hypotheses are:  1. Patients being read a preoperative Comfort Talk script will experience less anxiety prior to anaesthesia induction. 2. The reduction of anxiety prior to induction is associated with better immediate and short-term recovery outcomes. 3. Patients being read a pre-extubation script will recover better than controls. 4. The combination of a pre-procedure script and a pre-extubation script will have the greatest positive effect on physical and emotional well-being in the immediate recovery period and at short term follow-up.
Assessment of Cognitive Functioning as it Relates to Risk for Suicide in Veterans With HIV/AIDS The purpose of this project is to gather pilot data related to exploring relationships between cognitive impairment and/or psychiatric distress and suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors in Veterans with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). To achieve this goal, a neuropsychological battery will be administered to Veterans with HIV/AIDS.
The Web-Based Education of Beginning Interns on Handoffs A handoff is defined as the transfer of role and responsibility from one person to another in a physical or mental process. Current evidence shows that handoffs between medical providers are both common, and fraught with potential for harm. In spite of these problems, handoff skills are rarely discussed or practiced. Currently, there are few curricula available in the literature regarding the teaching of handoff skills. The purpose of the investigators' study is to develop a curriculum focusing on key handoff safety issues. The investigators plan to create an independent learning tutorial that would be easily administered to all beginning interns (medical subinterns and 2nd month pgy1 medical interns), that would be accessible across multiple sites, that would increase learner knowledge regarding key handoff safety issues, and would improve trainee satisfaction with the handoff process. The investigators' goal is to make this curriculum practical and time efficient. The investigators' hope is that the educational intervention would also have a measurable impact on the quality of patient care.
The Effect of Continuous Sipping of a Glucose Solution on Markers of Oxidation in Men and Women The objective of this study is to determine the effect of reducing the rate of glucose absorption on oxidative stress after eating and to compare it with the effects of vitamin C. The hypothesis is that reducing the rate of glucose absorption will reduce oxidative stress to a similar extent as 1g vitamin C.
A Multi-Modal Remote Monitoring Platform for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) Syndromes The primary objective of this study is to enroll an observational cohort of approximately 60 patients with PSP over the course of 24 months using a multicenter study design and to follow each of them for 12 months.  The secondary objective of this study is to develop a robust solution for multi-modal remote monitoring of motor symptoms and function in PSP that can be applied to other Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes.
Different Taping Methods in Myofascial Pain Syndrome Myofascial pain syndrome is a musculoskeletal pain condition that originates from localized, tight areas of skeletal muscle and fascia, called trigger points. Myofascial pain syndrome is the most common cause of musculoskeletal pain and its prevalence in the community is reported to be 12-55%. Patients with myofascial pain syndrome have pain, stiffness, tenderness, burning, and squeezing sensations in the muscles. In treating myofascial pain syndrome, trigger points should be inactivated and normal body mechanics should be corrected as much as possible. Treatment of the trigger point may be the main goal of a physiotherapy rehabilitation program as it can rapidly reduce acute pain. The goal is to control pain, restore limited ROM, and return the muscle to its optimal length and position. One of the treatment methods applied in MAS is kinesio taping. Kinesio Taping is a non-invasive, painless and less time-consuming method with fewer side effects, widely used as a therapeutic tool in various prevention and rehabilitation protocols. It differs from other rigid tapes because it can stretch significantly (130-140% of its original length), reducing mechanical movement limitations and mimicking skin thickness and elasticity. It has been found to be effective in reducing pain and muscle spasm, increasing range of motion, improving local blood and lymph circulation, reducing edema, strengthening weakened muscles, and controlling joint instability and postural alignment.  Kinesiological tapes can be applied with different shapes and techniques according to the shape and size of the application area and the purpose of the application. Application techniques can be listed as muscle techniques, functional correlation techniques, fascia correlation techniques, star techniques (circulation / lymphatic correction technique), ligament/tendon correction (ligament) technique, mechanical correction techniques, and neural techniques. Functional correlation technique, which is one of the techniques the investigators will prefer in our study, is just above the area of pain, it lifts the skin, fascia, and soft tissue thanks to the elastic properties of the band, thereby reducing the pressure under the application area, reducing the irritation in the chemical receptors and nociceptors, reducing the lymphatic circulation. It is claimed that it increases blood circulation and helps to remove exudate more effectively, and as a result, it helps to reduce pain. The fascia correlation technique, which is the other technique the investigators would prefer to use in our study, is used to bring the fascial tissue to the desired position. The main goal is to reduce tension and adhesions by making vibration (oscillation) movement between the fascia layers. Another technique the investigators will use in our study is the star technique. This technique is aimed at reducing the pressure on the lymphatic vessels and creating a gap that allows circulation in the tissue. Fan-cut tape is often used. Our study aims to compare the effects of 3 different taping techniques (correction, fascia correction, and star technique) in individuals with Myofascial Pain Syndrome with a trigger point in the trapezius muscle.

Effects of Buspirone in Opiate Withdrawal Dependence on heroin is a major public health problem because of its association with criminality, law enforcement costs and healthcare costs. Managed withdrawal is a required first step for a long term drug-free treatment of heroin addicts. Methadone and clonidine have been the mainstay of treatment for the relief of heroin withdrawal symptoms but both have limitations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of buspirone in the alleviation of the withdrawal symptoms experienced by heroin addicts when they stop using heroin. Buspirone is a non opiate drug with no abuse potential, no sedating effects and no withdrawal symptoms.
Cardioprotective Benefit of Passive Heat Therapy in Higher-Level Spinal Cord Injury: Safety and Proof of Concept As compared to the general population, those living with a spinal cord injury (SCI) are at a greater risk of cardiovascular (CV) diseases.The investigators know that regular exercise can help lessen the risk of CV diseases. However, those with higher level SCI have a limited ability to exercise due to their loss of function. Heat therapy has been shown to promote significant health benefits in populations with health challenges and has demonstrated a mild exercise like response. The investigators aim to extend these findings and develop a practical passive heat therapy program appropriate for safe home use.
Genetic Basis of Mitral Valve Prolapse The investigators have successfully identified two novel genetic loci for MVP on chromosomes 11 and 13 and are searching for altered genes in these regions. This requires recruiting large families who may have MVP linked to these or other chromosomes; and obtaining DNA samples from 1,000-1,500 individually affected patients to study the relation between DNA markers throughout the genome and MVP. It is our expectation that the results of this study will lead to the discovery of gene(s) responsible for MVP. This will lead to improved understanding of the disease and, in turn, improved ability to treat and prevent progression in genetically susceptible individuals.

High Risk Myelodysplasia Treated by Azacytidine : Genetic and Epigenetic (MYRAGE) Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most frequent myeloid neoplasms in Western Countries.They mainly affect patients aged 65 years or older. This is a very heterogenous group of diseases, which prognosis is evaluated with International Prognosis Scoring System. High risk MDS present with high frequency of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. Treatment of high risk MDS often is based on hypomethylating agents, such as 5'-azacytidine (Azacytidine), with a complete response in approximativel 20% of cases..  This treatment is based on 4-week cycles, with daily injection during the first week and rest during the 3 next weeks of the cycle.  Azacytidine efficacy is commonly evaluated with clinical and biological parameters determined by the International Working Group 2006. These parameters are usually evaluated after at least 6 cycles of treatments.  There is a response with Azacytidine treatment in 60% of cases, including 40% of partial responses and 20% of complete responses. In 40% of patients, there is no response, which means that the disases is stable or in progression under therapy.  In this regard, early evaluation of treatment response is an issue. We want to improve our knowledge about early response criteria in Azacytidine-treated high-risk MDS, focusing on SMD with excess blasts, which represent 30 to 40% of total MDS.  Then, the investigator team want to compare DNA methylation profile at diagnosis and after 3 cycles of Azacytidine treatment.  Main objective :  Identify DNA methylation profiles related to response to Azacytidine therapy, after only 3 cycles of treatment, in high risk MDS with excess blasts.  Secondary objective :  Identify at diagnosis DNA methylation profiles that are predicitive of response to Azacytidin, in high risk MDS with excess blasts.

Cognitive-driven ADL Impairment as a Predictor for PDD Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) is the highest risk factor for Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). The core feature for differentiating PDD from PD-MCI is the loss of the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). As Parkinson's Disease (PD) is primarily a movement disorder, the distinction between motor and cognitive contributions to ADL in PD is an obvious challenge, which the investigators aimed to explore in this study. The goal of the study is to evaluate whether PD-MCI patients with more pronounced, cognitive-driven ADL impairment are at higher risk for cognitive worsening and PDD. A longitudinal follow-up assessment of 262 non-demented PD patients will be conducted over the next two years, with a comprehensive clinical assessment as well as biomarker sampling (cerebrospinal fluid and blood markers). Primary longitudinal outcome will be conversion to PDD and PD-MCI. Conversion rates of patients with and without additional mild cognitive-driven ADL impairment at baseline will be compared. Novel scores of the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) are used to assess instrumental ADL, differentiating between cognitive- and motor-driven ADL impairment in PD-MCI.

Effectiveness Fluoride Varnishes in Children With Early Childhood Caries The study was carried out in 88 children with severe early childhood caries (dmfs≥age +1) who were referred to the investigators' clinic. Patients who completed dental treatment under general anesthesia in a single session, were included to the study.  Patients were divided randomly into 4 groups and after dental treatment one of the fluoride varnish listed below was applied to each child. The groups were as follows;  1. Duraphat varnish containing 5% Sodium Fluoride (Colgate) (n = 22), 2. Clinpro ™ White Varnish containing 5% of Sodium Fluoride tricalcium phosphate (3M ESPE) (n = 22), 3. Embrace ™ Varnish containing 5% Sodium Fluoride with CXP ™ (Pulpdent) (n = 22), 4. MI Varnish containing 5% Sodium Fluoride casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate varnish (GC) (n = 22).  Saliva Mutans streptococci (MS) and Lactobacilli (LB) levels, were evaluated by taking saliva samples before general anaesthesia; one month after treatment and three months after treatment.
Mandibular Reconstruction With Axially Vascularised Bone Substitutes Mandibular reconstruction is necessary following trauma, tumour resections and extensive infections resulting in severe defects of the mandibular arch. For reconstructing large and recurrent defects, the vascularized free flaps are currently regarded as the gold standard. The use of these flaps, however, presents several major inconveniences. Although regenerative medicine in the field of cranio-maxillofacial reconstruction has now become a common practice, the main technical challenge is still related to vascularization of the regenerated tissue in large defects. Axial vascularization of constructs using a microvascular arteriovenous fistula/loop (AV loop) aims at providing the construct with blood supply through a defined and dedicated vascular axis. This technique was successfully demonstrated in some case reports, but was never applied in the craniofacial region. The current study aims to apply and assess the technique of axial vascularization using the AV loop of a bone substitute to reconstruct mandibular defects.

Attention Disengagement Training for Social Phobia Generalized Social Phobia is characterized by severe social anxiety that leads to functional impairment (Schneider et al., 1992). Despite its high prevalence, many individuals do not receive treatment or are unresponsive to current therapies. Thus there is a clear need to continue to develop highly effective and efficient treatments for social phobia. This three year project aims to test a computerized treatment for social phobia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to modify attention biases that may maintain anxiety.
Photobiomodulation & Ketogenic Diet for Treatment of Mid-periphery Retinal Disorders for Alzheimer's Disease Prevention The study will explore the impact of photobiomodulation (PBM), pulsating at frequencies of red (660nm) and near-infrared (810nm)(NIR), concurrent with a ketogenic dietary protocol (serum ketones @ .5 - 2.0 mmol/L) to mediate vascular features of diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema (DME), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), mid-peripheral drusens, visual acuity and retinal disorders. Red and near-infrared light via light-emitting diode (LED) treatment promotes retinal healing and improves visual acuity by augmenting cellular energy metabolism, enhancing mitochondrial function, increasing cytochrome C oxidase activity, stimulating antioxidant protective pathways and promoting cell survival. LED therapy directly benefits neurons in the retina, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the visual cortex; likewise, a ketogenic dietary protocol shows metabolic and neuro-modulatory benefits within the CNS, most notably as treatment for refractory epilepsy. Photobiomodulation has been approved as a non-significant risk (NSR) modality for the treatment of eye disorders.
Salivary Melatonin Levels and Sleep Quality in Patients With Burning Mouth Syndrome Burning mouth syndrome is an idiopathic condition characterized by symptoms burning and / or pain of the oral mucosa with an orderly clinical finding. So far not found a unique way of treatment. It is a diagnosis that impairs the quality of life of patients, and consequently it can affect the quality of sleep. Melatonin is a hormone secreted from pineal gland and regulates the day-night rhythm of man, and whose production in the body decreases aging. The level of melatonin in saliva correlates well with the level of melatonin in plasma, therefore they are advantages of determining from saliva painlessness and non-invasiveness of the procedure itself. The purpose of this study was to compare the level of melatonin in saliva and the quality of sleep with help of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale in patients with burning mouth syndrome and control groups of patients without subjective oral disorders and with an orderly clinical finding.

Extubation in Pediatric Patients: An Observational Study The timing of extubation following surgery and anesthesia in young children is a complex decision frequently guided by the experience of the clinician. The clinician frequently must make a decision based on assimilating multiple cues that may or may not demonstrate that the patient is ready for extubation such as eye opening, conjugate gaze, spontaneous ventilation, and end tidal agent concentration. At this time there is no published data on the predictive ability of individual extubation criteria for young patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery so most practice is based solely on experience and anecdotal teaching. In some cases if the timing is misjudged and the patient is extubated too early negative airway reflexes such as breath holding and laryngospasm may take over creating a critical situation in which the patient forgoes gas exchange and rapidly desaturates with the potential for bradycardia and further cardiovascular collapse.  Routine criteria used to determine fitness for extubation have been primarily described in the intensive care unit literature and may be less relevant in the operating room in the setting of routine general anesthetics. Most predictors including adequate tidal volume, presence of conjugate gaze, eye opening, patient movement purposeful or otherwise, low end tidal anesthetic agent concentration, response to physical or verbal stimulation and the laryngeal stimulation test have not previously been evaluated to determine their individual predictive value in deciding if the presently anesthetized patient now emerging is ready to be extubated.  In order to perform a laryngeal stimulation test the patient must be breathing spontaneously and practitioner will gently move the endotracheal tube up and down stimulating the larynx. In patients in stage 2 of anesthesia, the clinician will typically observe a cough or series of coughs followed by a respiratory pause of greater than 5 seconds. In this situation the patient has not adequately passed through stage 2 and remains at increased risk for apnea, breath holding, or laryngospasm. If the patient is in stage 1 of anesthesia the clinician will observe a cough followed by a brief pause (less than 5 seconds) or almost immediate return to spontaneous ventilation.  In conclusion, their exist no quantitative data on the predictive value of these various criteria for extubation and the goal of our study is determine the indivdual predictive value of different criteria in determing fitness for extubaion in young pediatric patients by recording the presence or absence of various criteria in pediatric patients at the time of extubation during routine anesthetic care.

Tailored Worksite Weight Control Programs Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity, worksite-based health promotion programs have been recommended due to their potential reach and social support impact. Within worksite contexts, many strategies to prevent and treat obesity have focused on educational programs delivered in person or to small groups that target knowledge acquisition and strategies targeted at individuals to improve their dietary and activity practices. These programs have been criticized because they typically reach a small percentage of workers-and seldom those that could benefit most, are of short duration, and have typically small effects that are not sustained. They have also typically been conducted in large worksites that have the greatest resources. The lack of success of these programs may be due to: 1) inadequate intervention intensity, 2) implementation challenges, and 3) a lack of theoretical models as the bases for intervention development. To overcome the limitations of previous research we will conduct a 2 group randomized controlled trial to determine the reach and effectiveness of an extensive intervention that: (a) is based upon sound theory, (b) is delivered primarily through scalable interactive technologies, and (c) leverages the existing organizational and environmental context of the workplace.

Allogeneic CD19 CAR-T Cells for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma Preclinical and clinical studies of CD19 CAR-T in r/r B-NHL have been extensively carried out. At the beginning of 2020, MorphoSys submitted its company-targeted CD19 monoclonal antibody to the FDA for r/r DLBL treatment and obtained FDA priority approval. It further confirms the safety and effectiveness of CD19 as a therapeutic target in r/r B-NHL. However, these CAR-T cells are constructed from patients' autologous T cells, and the production and preparation time is long; on the other hand, most patients have received multiple chemotherapy before CAR-T treatment, and the quantity and quality of T cells often cannot meet the needs of clinical treatment. It is also an important factor leading to the failure of CAR-T cell therapy, which limits the large-scale clinical application of CAR-T.  T cells sourced from healthy people are not only sufficient in quantity and quality guaranteed, but also available at any time. In December 2020, lancet\[2\] reported a clinical study of 19 patients receiving allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL. 14 patients were evaluated as CR/CRi (67%) 28 days after treatment, with a median sustained remission Time 4.1 months. Allogeneic CAR-T cells are safe and effective for the treatment of B-cell malignant diseases, and their clinical application range is expected to further improve the remission rate and survival rate of patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The Role of Narrow Band Imaging Videobronchoscopy in Lung Cancer Narrow band imaging (NBI) videobronchoscopy is an optical technique in which filtered light enhances superficial neoplasm based on their neoangiogenic pattern. The objectives of this study investigate its better diagnostic yield in the assessment of lung cancer than conventional flexible bronchoscopy.
Neural Substrates of Approach-Avoidance Conflict Background:  - People who are dependent on alcohol drink even when they know something bad might happen. Researchers want to learn more about why they do this.  Objectives:  - To study brain response when a person plays a game in different threat conditions.  Eligibility:  * Healthy right-handed adult heavy drinkers age 21 60 * Healthy right-handed adult light drinkers age 21 60  Design:  * Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests. They will have an EKG and psychiatric interview. * Participants will have one or two clinic visits. * Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking. * They will choose a snack and alcoholic beverage that they must drink in 5 minutes. After their breath alcohol content (BrAC) is zero, they will play a game in the MRI scanner. * The scanner is a metal cylinder that takes pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder. They will be in it for about 90 minutes, lying still for up to 20 minutes. * During the MRI, participants will play a simple computer game to earn food or drink points under different threats of electric shock. Points can be exchanged for food or alcohol after the game. Sometimes, participants will receive a mild electric shock through a metal disk on the wrist. Electric shocks will only happen if the participant tries to earn a reward point. * After the MRI, participants use their points for another drink and snack. They will stay at the clinic until their BrAC is low, usually within 3 hours. Participants cannot drive themselves home. * Participants will have a follow-up phone call the next day.

Also to determine if preoperative serum testosterone levels are predictive of bacterial load of deep tissue cultures taken at the time of revision shoulder arthroplasty in patients undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty.
Validation of the Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS) on the CRCDS-miniSim Subjects will participate in a 4-visit study protocol at the National Advanced Driving Simulator, part of the University of Iowa, in which they will be asked to complete assorted questionnaires, computerized cognitive tasks, and a simulator drive. Subjects will be administered 0.75 mg alprazolam (Xanax) or placebo and 500 mg vaporized cannabis (6.18% THC / \<0.025% CBD) or placebo (0% THC / 0% CBD).  The primary objective of this study is to validate the Drug Impaired Driving Scenario (DIDS) using the CRCDS-2 driving simulator by assessing the acute effects of cannabis relative to placebo on simulated driving performance. Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by the significant effect of 0.75 mg alprazolam (active comparator) on driving and cognitive endpoints.
Erector Spinae Block, Epidural Analgesia and Intrathecal Analgesia in Thoracic Surgery Pulmonary thoracic surgery is often responsible for severe postoperative pain, which is associated with an increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Moreover, postoperative thoracic pain has a strong impact on patient rehabilitation and is associated with an increase in hospital stay.  Various analgesic techniques allow effective management of pain in the context of thoracic surgery. Regional anesthesia, particularly, allows a powerful analgesia, and limits the use of opioids and their side effects. Among regional anesthesia techniques, thoracic epidural analgesia has become the gold standard for post-thoracotomy analgesia. However, it induces a sympathetic block that promotes in particular per and postoperative hypotension and acute urinary retentions. Thus, new regional anesthesia techniques have been developed and assessed in thoracic surgery in order to avoid side effects related to epidural analgesia, particularly paravertebral block and erector spinae block, but also intrathecal analgesia. Paravertebral block has shown analgesic efficacy after thoracic surgery, and its interest in reducing the risk of hypotension, acute urinary retention, pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting compared with the epidural analgesia. Erector spinae block, recently described and evaluated in this context of thoracic surgery, seems to have the same interests and to be easier to achieve than the paravertebral block, but has been little studied. Finally, intrathecal morphine is frequently used because of an easy and rapid realization, and because it allows an adequate analgesia and the reduction of the duration of stay in intensive care compared to the epidural one. However, despite its frequent use, very few studies have compared intrathecal anesthesia with the epidural and other peri-spinal blocks.  These three types of analgesia, epidural analgesia, intrathecal morphine, and erector spinae block are regional anesthesia methods regularly used for pulmonary surgery in the department of the investigators. All of these techniques have shown their analgesic efficacy, but each seems to have particular respective interests, in terms of achievement, management, or perioperative rehabilitation. The objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the effectiveness of each of its techniques to treat postoperative pain and improve the rehabilitation of these patients.

Dorsomedial Prefrontal Neuromodulation in Treatment-resistant Depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and troublesome disorder, with high risk of physical and psychiatric comorbidity. At least one-third of patients could not achieve a response after several antidepressant trials, so-called treatment-refractory depression (TRD). The high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) at left-sided dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) have a response rate of 40-60%. Obviously, not all TRD patients achieve the remitted state after treatment with antidepressants or DLPFC-rTMS, which may result from the heterogeneity of MDD. More and more evidence, such as brain lesion studies, deep brain stimulation, open-labeled rTMS case series, and neuroimaging studies, suggests that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) might play a more central role in the pathophysiology of major depression. The DMPFC demonstrated as a "dorsal nexus" phenomenon in depression, which means a unique brain region where cortical networks for affect regulation, default mode control and cognitive control coverage in depressed subjects but not in healthy persons. In addition, another meta-analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) demonstrated the abnormal functional connectivity from DMPFC. These abnormalities of networks were highly associated with several depressive symptoms such as anhedonia, emotional regulation, somatic markers, rumination, self-reflection, poor attention and poor decision-making. However, only a handful of studies investigated the brain stimulation targeting DMPFC and the further changes in brain functional connectivity. The clinical efficacy and the fMRI changes of prolonged intermittent theta-burst stimulation (piTBS) and 20Hz- rTMS targeting bilateral DMPFC were investigated, and the predictive value of baseline networks by fMRI for antidepressant responses was also assessed to find a reliable approach to gauge treatment response prospectively.
Efficacyof Pilates Exercises in Lowback Pain OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of pilates exercise by training the muscles responsible for core stabilization in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLPB); considering pain, functional level, depression, quality of life, and muscle thickness measured by Ultrasound Imaging and to compare it with home based exercise.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized-single blinded study included 60 female patients with CNLBP aged 18-60 years. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. The first group (n=30) performed pilates 3 days/week for 8 weeks. Sessions lasted about one hour and supervised by a pilates trainer. The second group (n=30) was given home exercise program 3 times/week for 8 weeks, each session lasting one hour. The evaluations were made both at the beginning and end of the treatment. Evaluation parameters included VAS (visual analogue scale), Oswestry Disability Index, Qubec Disability Scale, Short Form-36 (SF-36), Beck Depression Questionnaire, sit and reach test, Modified Schöber test, sit up test. Multifidus and abdominal muscle thickness were measured by Ultrasonographic Imaging.

Craniosacral Therapy as a Self-help Strategy for Patients With Chronic Non-specific Back Pain Craniosacral Therapy (CST) is a non-manipulative, very gentle manual treatment method. Although the mechanisms of action have not yet been investigated sufficiently, initial clinical trials support CST efficacy/effectiveness in chronic pain disorders such as back pain, neck pain, and fibromyalgia. In clinical practice, therapists also report pain alleviating effects of CST self-help techniques, offered to patients within a group concept. Yet, the effectiveness of teaching CST self-help techniques to medical laypersons has not yet been scientifically investigated.  Therefore, this study aims at collecting quantifiable data on the effectiveness and safety of a CST self-help group concept, developed for patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. The intervention group will receive 24 lessons of education and practice in CST self-help techniques over 12 weeks, while the control group will receive the same amount of self-help (education and practice) in progressive muscle relaxation. Six and 12 months after randomization, longer-term effects will be investigated.

Skin Camouflage for Women Prisoners With Self-Harm Scarring Women prisoners are more likely to commit suicide or self-harm than women in the community or male prisoners.  Healthcare services have improved how they manage self-harm in the community and prisons. However, there has been little focus on the recovery of people with self-harm scars. Medical skin camouflage (MSC) is a British National Formulary-listed topical cream designed to cover skin conditions. Research on MSC has focused on its use with non-self-harm marks e.g. burns. The evidence from this research suggests that the cream helps women feel better and do more activities. There is little/no evidence about the effects of the preparation for women who self-harm and for prisoners.  This research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Research for Patient Benefit Programme. In the research the investigators will examine whether it is possible and practical to use MSC in prison. The investigators will ask women prisoners and staff what they think about the cream. The research has four parts. In the first part the investigators will run focus groups with women prisoners and prison staff to find out the best way to deliver the MSC intervention and how to measure its effects. In the second part the investigators will design a programme for delivering the MSC. The investigators will then train 6-10 long-term prisoners to become skin camouflage practitioners. The final part will involve a small randomised controlled trial with 40 women prisoners; 20 will be allocated to the intervention group and will use the MSC for 6 weeks. The investigators will measure their mood, thoughts of self-harm and wellbeing before and after they use MSC. The investigators will compare these results with 20 women who have not used MSC (waitlist control group). All women taking part will be placed at random into the control or the treatment group. The control group will receive the MSC after the research has ended.  Potential benefits of this study may be an increase in self-esteem and quality of life for the women prisoners. As women recover they may be less likely to self-harm.
A Parent-Based Intervention to Reduce Sexual Risk Behavior in Adolescents The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and efficacy of a triadic intervention designed to target both healthcare providers and parents in order to prevent adolescent sexual risk behavior in Latino and African American adolescents.

Study of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules in the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma The study aims to observe and investigate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib capsules in patients with locally advanced or metastatic radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma in the real world, and to summarize the treatment experience in a broad population.
High Resolution Colonic Manometry in Relation to 3D-Transit Times in Healthy Controls. Background: Within recent years, new methods for detailed assessment of gastrointestinal (GI) motility have been developed. Hence, the electromagnetic 3D-Transit system is a safe, non-invasive method for detailed description of GI motility. The system tracks the exact position of an ingested electromagnetic capsule through the entire GI tract and provides detailed information on both regional transit- and contraction patterns. High Resolution Colonic Manometry (HRCM) allows extremely detailed description of contraction patterns in the colon. The HRCM is however an invasive method, as the catheter is placed during colonoscopy. Before widespread use of capsule-based techniques (3D-Transit or others), the system needs to be validated by another method.  Study Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate weather pressure changes measured by HRCM correlate with passage patterns recorded by 3D-Transit. This has been assumed so far, but has never been further investigated.  Hypothesis: Movement of the electromagnetic 3D-Transit capsule within the colon correspond well with pressure changes determined with HRCM.  Materials and methods: HRCM and 3D-transit will be performed simultaneously in 20 healthy participants. A colonoscopy is performed to install the HRCM catheter and place two 3D-Transit capsules within the colon. For 24 hours, the participants lie in a bed in the research lab while pressure changes from the HRCM catheter are recorded and the 3D-Transit capsules are followed through the gastrointestinal system.  Perspectives: If data from the 3D-Transit technique correlate well with HRCM, the method provide a non-invasive alternative allowing detailed assessment of colonic motility.
Efficacy and Safety of the DYNAtraq Device to Prevent Complications in Tracheostomy in Mechanically Ventilated Patients Although tracheostomy is a common technique in Intensive Care Units (ICU), its complications can be frequent (between 5% to 40%). Inadequate fixation could favor decannulation, as well as incorrect alignment of the tracheostomy with respect to the tracheal axis could favor the appearance of tissue alterations such as ulcers, bleeding or fistulas, as well as obstruction of the ventilatory obstruction. Having a device that is effective in fixation and alignment could help in reducing tracheostomy complications, so this study aims to evaluate the effect and safety of a fixation device for tracheostomy through a randomized clinical trial.
Innovative Methods to Reduce Emissions and Health Impacts of Deep-frying Cooking oil fume (COF) is a significant source of PM2.5 for poorly ventilated space indoors and in urban streets near restaurants or night markets. Modern Chinese cooking produces high concentration of COF especially from deep-frying foods and stirred frying. Emission from high-temperature frying has been classified by the IARC as Group 2A carcinogen. Cooks are at high risk of exposure to toxic compounds from cooking fumes. However, more of the COF-related studies focused on the home kitchen and less addresses the problems in the restaurants. Studying health hazards and biomarkers of cooks may provide opportunities to understand biological mechanisms and to search and test efficacy for measures to overturn such risks.  The investigators will recruit 80 cooks who handle deep-frying and stirred frying on daily basis. The 80 cooks will be randomized to 4 groups: (1) control, (2) vegetable and fruits extract (V\&F) group, (3) fish oil group, and (4) V\&F-fish oil group will be provided to the participants for 2 months V\&F capsules (equivalent to 4 servings a day) and fish oil capsules (1\~1.5 serving a day) and placebos of the same appearance. Heart rate variability (HRV), pulmonary functions, bio-markers, oxylipins and metabolomics profile will be measured as outcomes.

Omega 6:Omega 3 Ratio and Progression of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation has been shown to prevent specific age-related changes in the retina through biochemical and functional evaluations, but it is unclear whether increased DHA intake-reflected through elevated DHA+EPA blood levels-can affect the natural history and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a disease affecting the macula, the part of the eye containing cone photoreceptors at the center of the visual field. The macula is responsible for vision in most daily functions, including reading, seeing fine details, and colour recognition. Severe AMD can lead to a central scotoma, severely impairing daily functioning. AMD can be divided into two forms: the more severe wet AMD, consisting of proliferation of new blood vessels in the retina, and dry AMD characterized by the development of drusen, a buildup of extracellular material . The investigators are focused on the group with the highest risk of developing the two advanced forms of AMD \[wet AMD or central geographic atrophy\]: patients with unilateral wet AMD and dry AMD in their other eye. The study will consist of following up a cohort of such subjects and monitoring their visual function in a comprehensive manner. Working in concert with clinical ophthalmologists and basic scientists, the investigators will monitor "DHA+EPA" and "Omega6:Omega3 fatty acid ratio" levels in the blood, inherited predispositions through genetic analysis, lipofuscin (an accumulated waste product) levels \& AMD progression via fundus photography, visual acuity, and retinal function via full-field and multifocal electroretinograms. These different factors will be cross-correlated and evaluated to determine how omega-3 fatty acids affect the progression of AMD.

Lentiviral Vector Gene Therapy - The Guard1 Trial of AVR-RD-02 for Subjects With Type 1 Gaucher Disease This is a multinational, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of AVR-RD-02 in approximately 8 to 16 subjects (male or female) who are ≥18 and ≤50 years of age and postpubertal at Screening with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease (based on clinical phenotype, genotyping, and deficient GCase enzyme activity in whole blood).
Inhaled Mometasone to Reduce Painful Episodes in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease The proposed research is designed to test the global hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a therapy developed to treat asthma, will prevent vasoocclusive painful episodes in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who wheeze, but do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) Conduct a feasibility study - a randomized controlled trial of ICS for adults with SCD who do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma but report recurrent cough or wheezing, 2) Measure the effects of ICS on biological correlates of pulmonary inflammation (as determined by exhaled nitric oxide) and vascular injury (as determined by sVCAM) in SCD, and 3) Compare properties of traditional and Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design for therapeutic trials in SCD in preparation for designing a definitive trial of ICS. These aims have the potential to 1) change the standard of care for individuals with SCD and recurrent cough or wheeze, 2) provide insight into the pathogenesis of non-asthmatic wheezing in SCD and its response to treatment, 3) explore the suitability of innovative clinical trial designs to overcome the challenges that have hindered therapeutic innovation for SCD.
The Effect of Testosterone Supplementation on Rehabilitation Outcomes The objective of this project is to determine the safety and efficacy of testosterone supplementation as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy in the care of deconditioned older men. Our long range goal is to determine whether other hormones (e.g., combined testosterone and growth hormone) are helpful as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy.  This project is important to the VA health care system because 38% of American veterans are aged (age \> 65 years), bioavailable testosterone is diminished in older age men, low testosterone is associated with impaired muscle strength, and lack of muscle strength hinders rehabilitation. Older men who are not successfully rehabilitated often get admitted to nursing homes for long term care, at a cost of approximately $40,000/year. Payment for long term care is currently one of our most difficult health care problems. If testosterone supplementation improves rehabilitation outcomes, as our pilot data suggest it will, patients will be more satisfied and long-term care financial resources will be saved.  We will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that supplementation with testosterone improves rehabilitation outcomes in deconditioned older men. Specifically, we will screen all hospitalized older men with delayed discharge from the hospital (\> 7 day hospital stay). Men who have at least one new impairment in their ability to perform activities of daily living (e.g., inability to walk), low serum testosterone concentration, and no contraindications (e.g., prostate or breast cancer) will be offered the opportunity to participate. Study participants will be randomized to receive either testosterone (5 mg transdermally each night) or placebo (matching transdermal patch) daily in a double-blind fashion for the duration of their hospital course (expected average duration of study is 29 days). Subjects will then receive their rehabilitation as usual, with all members of the health care team blinded as to whether the subject is receiving testosterone or placebo. At baseline, weekly, at discharge, and at 6 and 12 months after discharge, subjects will be assessed using validated measures (i.e., Functional Independence Measure - FIM). Our hypothesis is that testosterone supplementation, as an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy, will improve rehabilitation outcomes.

The pain and range of shoulder movement are assessed before and after the treatment in all the participants.  Hypothesis of the clinical study: the treatment of diaphragm muscle, via manual release or active mobilization, has impact on rotator cuff injury symptoms comparing with a standard treatment of shoulder myofascial trigger points release.  Discussion: The relation between shoulder and diaphragm muscle, through innervation (phrenic nerve and brachial plexus), embryology and myofascial connections, could lead to include in clinical practice the examination and treatment of other structures besides shoulder girdle such as diaphragmatic region in rotator cuff injuries.
Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy for Spastic Plantar Flexor Muscles in Young Children With Cerebral Palsy The purpose of this study is to determine whether radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy in combination with traditional physical therapy is safe and effective for the management of spastic plantar flexor muscles in patients with cerebral palsy younger than averaged three years of age.
Perioperative Management of Patients With Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices Data on the perioperative management of patients cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is limited and published guidelines rely mainly on the experience of the cardiologists and anesthesiologists who manage these patients. Depending on the device type and patient's dependency, these guidelines recommend the intraoperative magnet use, reprogramming of devices or no action. Magnet placement on a CIED (very simple and applicable method) has become the standard approach in many centers, while CIED reprograming by trained personnel is required in most centers. Therefore, our objective is to compare in a prospective randomized clinical trial the safety of intraoperative magnet use vs. CIEDS reprogramming vs. no intervention (in the appropriate subjects)
Manual Ankle Rocking Training on Postural Control and Foot Function in Children With Down Syndrome Down syndrome occurs due to abnormal cell division of extra chromosome 21. It is a genetic disorder that causes postural un stability, leads to poor foot function and causes them difficulty that they can't fulfill their daily life activities and can't be independent. Strengthening exercise of lower limb and core strengthening of trunk muscle will provide postural stability and lower limb strengthening. Aim of this research is to determine the effects of manual Ankle rocking training on postural control and foot function in children with Down syndrome. Those who are diagnosed with down syndrome and are between age 8-15 and both of the genders are included in this research and those who have any surgical issue, visual impairment and musculoskeletal contractures are not included in the study we will use static standing balance test to check postural control and foot function index for Ankle rocking training from two group in which one will be given the baseline treatment of lower limb exercise and core strengthening with ankle rocking training and the other group without ankle rocking training and then the collected data will be analyzed by SPSS. 22

Upregulation of PSMA Receptors After Androgen Deprivation Therapy on PSMA PET/CT Imaging in Prostate Cancer Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein, which is overexpressed on prostate cancer cells and is well-characterized as an imaging biomarker of prostate cancer. Studies have shown that PSMA PET/CT can detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and a high detection rate even when the level of prostate specific antigen is low. PSMA imaging is considered the gold standard in imaging of biochemical recurrence, with detection rate of recurrence in 79.5% of patients, in the largest series of 1007 patients. Despite these excellent results, there remains approximately 20% of patients in whom the site of biochemical recurrence cannot be identified and further research is needed into improving detection rates.  Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), represents the standard of care treatment for most men with a rising serum PSA and no evidence of disseminated disease on imaging modalities. There has been some preliminary data that imaging patients early after initiation of ADT therapy may increase detection rates of recurrence sites.  The objective of this study is to evaluate if prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence and negative PSMA PET/CT can demonstrate in-vivo upregulation of PSMA receptors in an attempt to improve detection rates of recurrent prostate cancer. Patients who are started on ADT when clinically indicated, will have repeat PSMA PET/CT at 4 weeks following initiation of ADT therapy.
WHNRC (Western Human Nutrition Research Center) Honey Study The purpose of this research is to compare two snacks, one with honey and nuts and the other with sugar and nuts, on glucose levels before and after eating these snacks.  The investigators hypothesize that honey and nuts will have an additive effect on the reduction of postprandial glucose response. The investigators further hypothesize that consumption of honey paired with nuts will retain the benefit of sugar consumption in satiety and reduction of metabolic stress.
Personalized Treatment for Eating Disorders Versus CBT-E Trial The scientific premise, developed from past work, is that treatment personalized based on idiographic models (termed Network Informed Personalized Treatment; NA-PT) will outperform the current gold-standard treatment (Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: CBT-E). The study goals are to (1) develop and test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a randomization of NA-PT versus CBT-E and (2) to test if network-identified precision targets are the mechanism of change. These goals will ultimately lead to the very first personalized treatment for ED and can be extended to additional psychiatric illnesses. Specific aims are (1) To collect preliminary data on the feasibility and acceptability of the randomization of NA-PT (n=40) for EDs versus CBT-E (n=40), (2) To test the initial clinical efficacy of NA-PT versus CBT-E on clinical outcomes (e.g., ED symptoms, body mass index, quality of life) and (3) To examine if changes in NA-identified, precision targets, as well as in dynamic network structure, are associated with change in clinical outcomes.

Effect of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Lung Cancer Survivors Patients who have surgery to cure lung cancer often have multiple problems at hospital discharge and later on. This includes poor exercise performance and quality of life, breathlessness, pain and tiredness. Currently there is little formal physical or psychological support for such patients. This pilot study aims to investigate whether outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (an exercise training and education programme), started within 2 weeks of hospital discharge, can lead to improvements in exercise performance and quality of life in patients who have undergone lung cancer surgery. The study will also assess whether pulmonary rehabilitation is acceptable for patients and will analyze the safety profile. The hypothesis is that patients; discharged from hospital after undergoing lung cancer surgery, have improved exercise performance and quality of life following early outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation compared with usual care.
Left Ventricular Dyssynchrony in Multipole Pacing Left ventricular dyssynchrony will be assessed by echocardiography using different programming of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
South Asian Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy Registry Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) is increasingly identified as an important cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality, especially of SCD, in a younger population.  Although there are no epidemiological data available, the investigators' experience is that in the North Indian region, ACM is rare outside our regions. ACM is also an understudied cardiac disorder in the South-Asian region.  An ethnic nonmigratory population inhabits the two regions, and consanguineous marriages are common. Based on these observations, the investigators firmly believe that there may be a founder gene in our populations responsible for the increased incidence of ACM.  Our project includes a thorough phenotypic analysis ((ECG, Holter, and echocardiography) in the ACM patients and their first-degree relatives; cardiac MRI and high resolution endocardial bipolar and unipolar voltage mapping (using HD grid catheter) in the patients.  The patient provided blood for the extraction of DNA will first undergo target panel sequencing for 20 known classic right-dominant ACM and left-dominant ACM. If this is negative for known pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants but identified novel variants of uncertain significance (VUS), then co-segregation analysis in family members will be performed. This technique can provide helpful information to reclassify VUSs. If both these are negative, then whole-exome 'trio' analysis will be performed, whch includes the proband and two family members, to triangulate from all 20,000 genes to a list of candidates for further interrogation.  The investigators wish to provide comprehensive answers to the research question by combining the genetic analysis with phenotypic evaluation.
Abilify Therapy for Reducing Comorbid Substance Abuse It is hypothesized that the use of aripiprazole (Abilify) in patients with alcohol and/or drug dependence with comorbid psychiatric conditions will lead to:  * Reduction in the amount of alcohol and/or drugs used as measured by the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) and the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) * Reduction in cravings for alcohol and drugs as measured by the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale * Reduction in symptoms of co-morbid psychiatric disorders compared to before starting aripiprazole.

Low Field and High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging Assessments on Pediatric Patients Hyperfine Research, Inc. has taken advantage of technological advances and developed an MRI device that is not only portable, but also uses a very-low magnetic field strength, \[less than 0.2 Tesla or approximately 10 times less\] than the field strength of conventional devices. This critical difference allows HRI to address MRI's core challenges by, first, operating at very low magnetic field strengths, eliminating the need for special rooms or shielding. Second, there are minimal safety concerns regarding ferrous metals near the system, as the field strength is too low to attract metal objects. The removal of metal, including items such as jewelry, belts, etc. from clothing and person, prior to being scanned, is unnecessary. Third, the design constraints faced by conventional MRI systems are lifted at low magnetic field and an open device has been designed to minimize anxiety that may come with claustrophobic patients. All of this is possible while still providing image quality that is clinically relevant to a wide variety of fields, including radiology, neurology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, and others.
A Phase 1b/2a Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Rhu-plasma Gelsolin in Hospitalized Subjects With CAP A Phase 1b/2a, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Dose-escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Recombinant Human Plasma gelsolin (rhu-pGSN) Added to Standard of Care in Subjects Hospitalized for Acute Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
Improving Decision Role Concordance in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients The goal of this project is to test the effects of the Patient Preference Scale as the basis for a clinical intervention for role negotiation in breast cancer surgery decisions and the Patient Perception Scale to measure role concordance. The investigators hypothesize that better role concordance will be achieved with a simple provider-based intervention. In the first half of the study, providers will be blind to the patient's preferred role. In the second half, providers will be made aware of the preferred role prior to the encounter and will have a brief conversation with the patient about their desired role in the decision making process.
Probiotics in Preventing Antibiotic Associated Diarrhoea Including Clostridium Difficile Infection Antibiotics are currently required to treat patients in hospital when they have an infection, but these antibiotics can cause side effects such as diarrhoea and in some patients a serious form of gut infection with an organism called Clostridium difficile. This organism can produce toxins in the gut causing a severe form of diarrhoea associated with a lot of ill health, and in some circumstances can be fatal. Some studies have shown that yogurts' or Probiotics' (special drinks with a defined concentration of useful bacteria) taken by patients can have a beneficial effect in reducing the diarrhoea associated with antibiotics use. The aim of the present study is to find out whether the use of one of these Probiotics in hospitalised patients taking antibiotics will result in less diarrhoea, less Clostridium difficile infection, as well as cost saving. The study will also analyze the effects of probiotics on quality of life and length of hospital stay.

Effects of Manual Therapy on Autonomic Nervous System's Balance, Pain and Well-being in Patients With Fibromyalgia. Scientific literature dealing with patients with fibromyalgia conveys they suffer from an abnormal response of the autonomic nervous sýstem, where a marked sympathetic hyperactivity and a decrease in heart rate variability are emphasized. It is important to know what manual therapy techniques may manage to decrease the sympathetic activity and balance the sympathetic-vagal tone, therefore improving pain and life quality.  This study will compare the effects of joint passive mobilization with the effects of soft tissue active mobilization on heart rate variability (as an indicator of autonomous regulation), psychological well-being (measured by the Ryff scale) and pain in patients with fibromyalgia.
Construction of a Multidimensional Score for the Functional Prognosis of Cerebral Infarctions In France, stroke is the leading cause of non-traumatic acquired motor disability in adults, the second leading cause of major cognitive impairment, and the third leading cause of death in men and women. The average age of onset is 73 years (70 years for men, 76 years for women). All types combined, approximately 100,000 patients are hospitalized for stroke each year, approximately 40,000 people die and 30,000 have serious after-effects at one year. The spectrum of functional sequelae ranges from motor and sensory impairment to cognitive impairment; moreover, 30 to 50% of patients have a recurrence within 5 years.  Data from the Dijon Stroke Registry showed in 2011 that only 36% of people who had a stroke between 2000 and 2009 were symptom-free 1 month after the event; 22% of patients had mild or moderate disability according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS); and 42% were unable to walk without assistance or had died. Based on 2009 self-reported data, more than one in two (51%) of those with a history of stroke with sequelae reported significant difficulty or inability to walk 500 meters; 45% had difficulty with at least one activity of daily living. The mortality rate was 44.7 per 100 000 persons in 2013.  Cerebral infarctions (CIs) account for the majority of strokes (70-75%). In 2014, despite a 12.5% decrease from 2008, hospital case fatality for CIs remained high at 9%. In 2015, the case fatality rate was 10.7% at 30 days and 11.9% at 1 year. Thirty-day mortality alone concentrated nearly half (47%) of the 1-year mortality.
Safety Profile Evaluation of TICagrelor Alone Compared to a Combination of Lysine Acetylsalicylate-Clopidogrel in the Context of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is now the method of choice to treat aortic stenosis in old and frail patients. Antiplatelet therapy must be associated for the procedure and during few weeks after implantation in the aim to minimize cerebral embolization. But for now, the best antiplatelet regimen has to be determined. In this context, investigators want to evaluate the safety of use of ticagrelor alone versus standardized therapy which involves lysine acetylsalicylate and clopidogrel. In this study, we will randomly compare 154 patients in each group in terms of early safety (30 days) after the procedure.

HIV/AIDS Orphaned and Vulnerable Children Public Health Evaluation The PHE study is a two-year longitudinal study evaluating two interventions for reducing depression and HIV risk behaviors among highly vulnerable adolescents in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Research suggests that children affected by AIDS are at heightened risk of HIV infection relative to their peers; however, evidence on how best to address HIV prevention and psychological health among this population is lacking. This study examines the efficacy of both a psychological and behavioral intervention, alone and in combination, on related outcomes among vulnerable youth age 14-17. A mixed methods approach is applied, including a community-randomized controlled trial with a factorial design, a cost-effectiveness analysis, and a qualitative component. At baseline data collection in January 2012, more than 1000 adolescents and their caregivers were interviewed; these participants were invited to take part in two more survey rounds designed to examine both the immediate and long term effects of the interventions. Support for this research was provided by USAID under Grant No. GHH-I-00-007-00069-00.

Aprepitant for Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Laparoscopic Hysterectomy * Gynecological surgery is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. * NK1 receptor antagonists such as aprepitant appear to be highly effective for treating acute and delayed emesis, and yet understanding of the efficacy of different doses of aprepitant is limited. * We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled study of 123 female adults scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy who received 80 mg aprepitant, 125 mg aprepitant, or a placebo.
Ruxolitinib Phosphate, Tacrolimus and Sirolimus in Preventing Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease During Reduced Intensity Donor Hematopoietic Cell Transplant in Patients With Myelofibrosis This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when given together with tacrolimus and sirolimus in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease during reduced intensity donor hematopoietic cell transplant in patients with myelofibrosis. Sometimes transplanted cells from a donor can attack the normal tissue of the transplant patient called graft-versus-host disease. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also reduce graft-versus-host disease by reducing inflammation and immune modulation. Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together with tacrolimus and sirolimus after transplant may prevent graft-versus-host disease.

Paricalcitol and Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, docetaxel,, paclitaxel, and ixabepilone work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Paricalcitol may help chemotherapy drugs to kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs.  PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the best dose and best way to give paricalcitol and to see how well it works when given together with chemotherapy in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Long-term Endoscopic Follow-up of Benign Epithelial Gastric Polyps Benign epithelial gastric polyps are benign raised lesions that originate from the gastric mucosa or submucosa and protrude from the gastric cavity with a wide base or a pedicle.The diagnosis and treatment of benign epithelial gastric polyps are currently controversial. There is still a lack of clinical research evidence especially for the malignant tendency and related treatments of gastric polyps. Many doctors have ambiguous understanding of benign epithelial gastric polyps and their endoscopic management is still in a"one size fits all"mode in China, which greatly wastes medical resources and increases the medical risks of patients, So it is imminent to formulate management practices for the diagnosis and treatment of gastric polyps. Therefore, a full understanding of the clinical characteristics, endoscopic characteristics and long-term follow-up trends of benign epithelial gastric polyps is of great significance for clinicians to formulate reasonable treatment and follow-up plans. This study is a prospective, large-sample observational cohort study. It is planned to include 200 patients with biopsy confirmed benign epithelial gastric polyps participating in this study from September 10, 2020 to December 31, 2021 and followed up for 18 months. The main research endpoint is the correlation between size and pathological type of benign epithelial gastric polyps and polyps development. The secondary research endpoint is the correlation between type of benign epithelial gastric polyps and Helicobacter pylori infection. The research results will help provide long-term follow-up data for benign epithelial gastric polyps of different pathological types, thereby providing first-hand evidence-based medical data for formulating gastric polyp management guidelines, helping to efficiently screen high-risk groups and guiding their examination, treatment and long-term follow-up to achieve early detection and early treatment of gastric cancer, thereby reducing the mortality rate.

A Clinical Trial on a Group Treatment for Distressed Caregivers of Cancer Patients Background and study aims: Being a caregiver for someone with cancer can be very difficult emotionally. For many the patient is a family member or friend, and so this can cause the caregiver a great deal of psychological distress. There are currently very few studies looking into the effectiveness of psychological treatments for distressed caregivers of cancer patients. This study is looking at tailored group therapy program for carers of cancer givers. The aim of this study is to find out whether this program can help to lower levels of distress in cancer caregivers and help them to better cope with caring for someone with the illness.

Biobehavioral Effects of Topiramate on Cannabis-Related Outcomes in Adolescents Cannabis use is a significant public health concern that disproportionately affect youth. Although promising psychosocial interventions are being developed, most youth do not benefit from these interventions alone. Given the clinical demand for effective treatments, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) identified the critical need for data on the tolerability and potential efficacy of medications in adolescents. The purpose of this two-year study is to test if and how topiramate, a medication under intense study for treating several drugs of abuse, reduces cannabis use among teenagers. To this end, the investigators will randomize 56 nontreatment-seeking regular cannabis users (15 or 20 years old) to receive topiramate or placebo for 6 weeks. Youth will monitor their cannabis use for the 6-week period using handheld electronic diaries and complete assessments of reactivity to cannabis-related cues.

In addition, the research team seeks to meet quality measures relevant to value-based care delivery through IT infrastructure and clinical workflow processes. The research team also hopes to gain insights on clinician practice patterns related to advanced NSCLC, and the correlation between advanced NSCLC patients reported goals of care and advanced NSCLC patients' fit/frailty status and treatment decisions.
The Stress Responses of Fetuses and Infants Whose Mothers Smoked During Pregnancy It is generally understood that smoking during pregnancy has deleterious effects on the developing fetus, although research on smoking during pregnancy has been limited in focus, with most studies focused on birth weight of newborns and children's behavioral disturbances. However, little is known about the neurobiological underpinnings of nicotine-related developmental deficits and even less is known about genetic and environmental factors that may exacerbate the risk for such deficits in some children. In this study, we propose to examine the relation between antenatal exposure to nicotine and infants' stress-responses before and after birth (2-days, 6-months) and its moderation of by family-based stressors and genes related to nicotine metabolism and stress responsivity.  We hypothesize that the risk imposed on infants by antenatal exposure to nicotine is moderated by genotype that influences functioning of the HPA axis, metabolism of nicotine, and stress-levels and parenting that influence the development of neural substrates (HPA axis) and infants' capacity to cope with stress. There is a growing consensus that Gene x Environmental (G x E) interplay likely mediated by epigenetic effects constitute one of the central mechanism by which complex disorders develop. Our proposal offers an exceptional paradigm to explore the association between genes, environment, and G x E interactions on the neural and behavior response of children to stressful challenges.
Evaluation of Metoprolol Pharmacokinetics in Patients Receiving Hi Flux Hemodialysis The current study will evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of metoprolol in a cohort of 8 adult volunteers who are receiving regular hemodialysis treatment (HD) 3 days a week for 4 hours each day and have been taking a total daily dose of 25-200 mg of metoprolol succinate for \>30 days as part of their usual care. Blood sampling will occur over 10 hours, with frequent sampling during HD and in the 4 hours after termination of HD treatment. The 8 subjects will all receive their prescribed dose (25-200 mg total daily dose) 2 hours prior to HD treatment. The pre-HD sample will also be sent for pharmacogenomics genotyping. Safety and pharmacodynamic assessments (blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) assessments) will be performed throughout the study. Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) will be used to evaluate genotype of CYP2D6. CYP2D6 phenotype will be evaluated using the ratio of parent drug to metabolite. Non-compartmental analyses will be performed to compare maximum concentrations (Cmax), time to maximum concentration and area under the curve from time 0 to the last measurable sample (AUClast) between the two phases. Compartmental analyses will be performed to construct a model to explain time-dependent changes in metoprolol clearance. Monte Carlo simulations will be performed to compare metoprolol pharmacokinetic profiles on and off HD.
VOB560-MIK665 Combination First in Human Trial in Patients With Hematological Malignancies (Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma) The purpose of the study is to identify doses and schedules of VOB560 and MIK665 that can be safely given and to learn if the combination can have possible benefits for patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Multiple Myeloma (MM) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).  VOB560 and MIK665 are selective and potent blockers respectively of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein and of the myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL1) protein, proteins that may protect tumor cells from undergoing cell death. VOB560 and MIK665 are designed to block the functions of the BCL2 and MCL1 proteins, so that the tumor cells that rely on these proteins undergo cell death.  Preclinical data suggest that concomitant treatment with VOB560 in combination with MIK665 induces robust anti-tumor activity.
Evaluation of Factors II, VII, IX, X, and Proteins C and S, Following High-dose Vitamin K Supplementation The purpose of this study is to evaluate factor levels of the pro coagulant factors II, VII, IX, X, and the anticoagulant factors protein C and S in healthy volunteers during the intake of elevated levels of vitamin K in order to investigate whether there is any evidence that high dose vitamin K intake increases plasma coagulation factor activity.
Wii-Fit For Improving Activity, Gait And Balance In Alzheimer's Dementia Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) contributes to poor balance, impaired gait and functional status, thereby, increasing the risk of falls. AD is an independent risk factor for hip fractures. Those with balance problems and gait impairments are at higher risk for long term placement and death related to falls. Gait impairments in those with dementia include shortened step length, increased double support time, step to step variability, and decreased gait speed. These gait impairments worsen with dual tasking probably due to common brain areas involved in gait and other cognitive tasks.  Exercise interventions improve gait and balance in the elderly. In subjects with existing AD, physical activity has shown to prevent further cognitive decline and improve quality of life and prevent falls. However, it is difficult to engage patients with AD in long term exercise programs. The expense of physical therapy limits its easy accessibility. Use of everyday technology might bridge this gap by providing high level of engagement via the use of multimedia while providing a cost effective alternative. Wii Fit is one such multimedia platform.  Wii fit is a Nintendo gaming console used for aerobics, strength training and balance activities. This device includes a balance board that senses weight and shifts in movement and balance. Virtual trainers talk the user through the activity while tracking the user's progress.  Although some skilled nursing facilities have started using Wii game system adjunct to routine physical therapy, there have not been any studies. Anecdotal reports note improvement in balance and social benefits using the Wii Fit program. Physical therapists report the ability to customize Wii for each patient. Wii Fit can be successfully used in a cognitively impaired population. A unique feature of this approach is the enjoyment and enthusiasm that many patients derive which is reflected in high levels of engagement.  The invesitgators propose an 8 week prospective randomized study with the treatment group receiving the exercise program delivered by Wii-Fit system and the comparison arm receiving a walking exercise program in a community dwelling setting. Subjects in each arm will participate for 30 minutes daily five days a week.

The Plant-Based and Soul-Full Study (PASS) The goal of this study is to examine if exposure to vegan soul food restaurants can increase African American adults' perceived benefits of consuming plant-based foods more so than standard guidelines. Although the health benefits of vegan diets are well documented, many people are reluctant to commit to a vegan diet long term. Various issues like food preparation, a lack of social support, or other barriers are often mentioned as reasons why people can't be vegan. This study will (1) find out if short term exposure (i.e. 3 weeks) to culturally tailored curriculum focusing on the health benefits of consuming plant-based foods increases African American adults' perceptions of adopting a vegan diet. And (2) if eating out a few times a week at vegan soul food restaurants can further increase African American adults' perceived benefits of a vegan than having to prepare all meals at home.
Prophylaxis of Cytomegalovirus Infection With Adoptive Cell Inmunotherapy Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). Recently, strategies based on immunotherapy adoptive cells (IAC) with anti-CMV Cytolitic T Lymphocytes (CMV-CTLs) has been incorporated to prevent or treat CMV after HSCT. The aim to study donor derived CMV-CTLs after haploidentical HSCT (HAPLO) as prophylaxis for CMV infection in transplant patients. CMV-CTLs will be administer at day 21 (+-7 days) post-HAPLO. CMV DNA levels with quantitative PCR will be weekly monitored.
Metformin in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a tablet medication, called metformin, in flare-ups (exacerbations) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The investigators believe that metformin may effectively control the blood sugar level during COPD exacerbations. This is important because there is evidence that a high blood sugar level during exacerbations may be linked with a worse prognosis. The investigators also think that metformin may have other potentially useful effects on inflammation, antioxidant levels, the effectiveness of steroid treatment, and recovery.
Virtual Reality System to Increase Access to Exposure Therapy for Anxiety and OCD Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with fear provoking exposures is the most effective therapy for anxiety disorders. Investigators aim to enhance this therapy with the use of virtual reality exposures and to make therapy more available and accessible for patients with anxiety disorders. The societal benefit of increased access to therapy is that, if successful, it will increase the number of patients who receive appropriate treatment for an anxiety disorder.
Multimodal Exercises to Improve Leg Function After Spinal Cord Injury Many people with spinal cord injury (SCI) retain at least some movement below their injury, but their muscles often have a 'mind of their own'. Typical exercise programs focus on keeping muscles strong and flexible, but don't usually focus on helping patients control their muscles. The investigators' exercise research study will compare two different programs with the specific goal of improving conscious control of patients' muscles below the injury. This study focuses on those with 'chronic' SCI - the injury occurred at least one year prior to enrolling.  This is a single center study taking place in the Bronx, NY.  The first phase of the study will be observational - the investigators will analyze which nerve connections might remain partially intact through the injury (even if the nerves aren't consciously controlled). Participants with all severity of SCI may participate in this first phase.  The second phase of the study will involve people who retain at least slight ability to move their legs and the ability to move the arms against gravity. Each person will undergo two different exercise rehabilitation strategies: weight-supported treadmill training; and balance training combined with skilled arm or hand exercises.  The investigators will compare the effects of these exercise programs on a variety of outcomes, including gait speed, balance, strength, and muscle activation in response to brain stimulation.  The investigators hypothesize that participants with chronic SCI undergoing combined balance/arm/hand training will show improved outcomes when compared to traditional gait or balance training.

To Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Dual Anticoagulants i.e. Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin and Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin in Patients Suffering From an Acute Coronary Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have provided benefits to patients requiring anticoagulation for certain diseases by decreasing the burden of subcutaneous injections and the requirement for frequent monitoring through regular blood tests. DOACs do not require monitoring, have a more predictable pharmacokinetic (dosing) profile and have fewer interactions with other drugs. Various studies have reported the efficacy and safety of different dual-acting anticoagulants around the globe. However, there is little data available from Pakistan. Therefore, investigators propose this study to assess the efficiency and safety of rivaroxaban and clopidogrel along with aspirin in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of dual anticoagulants i.e. aspirin plus rivaroxaban versus aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome in terms of secondary prophylaxis. All the patient records will be documented in Case Report Form (CRF) at each visit. All data will be recorded in individual source documents. All CRF information is to be filled in by site staff. If an item is not available or is not applicable, this fact should be indicated. Blank spaces should not be present unless otherwise directed. The study monitor will perform source data verification of data entered into the CRF. The data entered into the CRF will be subject to data validation checks for consistency and completeness by the data management group. All CRFs should be maintained on the system with details of any changes logged accordingly.

Effect of a Nutritional Supplement on Mental Wellness in Adults Trillions of microbes reside in human gut and constitute "gut microbiota". Composition of these microbes and substances produced by them play an important role in human health and wellness.  The goal of this study is to determine if a unique orally consumed triglyceride supplement will impart mood benefits. Investigators hypothesize that a part of the fatty acids will be released in upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can be absorbed and reach different organs via systemic circulation (blood), including to the brain, and provide health benefits. Rest of the portion would reach the colon and may modulate gut microbiota and provide health benefits via the gut-brain axis (a bi-directional communication between emotional and cognitive centers and the gastrointestinal system). These health benefits could include alleviation of stress, occasional anxiousness and low mood.  Participants with self-reported low mood will be randomized to two groups - one group will receive triglyceride supplement in softgel form and another group will receive a placebo (softgel with no active substance). Investigators will evaluate the effect of consumption of triglyceride supplement compared to Placebo on occasional low mood, occasional anxiousness, stress, sleep and general health by measuring changes from baseline.
Prevalance of Temporomandibular Joint Disease Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders are common problems in the society and involve the masticator muscles, jaw joint and related structures. Since TMJ disorders affect functions such as eating and speaking, they can cause important problems in the daily life of the patient. Therefore, its diagnosis and treatment are of great importance. In the treatment of these patients, methods such as analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, splint, exercise, physical therapy modalities can be applied.
Massage Therapy for Phantom Limb Pain: Feasibility and Pilot Study Massage therapy is a treatment self-reported by those with phantom limb pain (PLP) as moderately to extremely effective, but no research to date has been specifically designed to examine such efficacy or effectiveness in this regard. The investigators propose that massage therapy can affect PLP by applying treatment to the corresponding intact limb for amputees. Theoretical underpinnings of massage and mirror therapy have guided this study's development to address PLP through the development of a novel massage intervention.  The proof-of-concept experimental study examines the feasibility and outcomes of a combined massage and mirror therapy treatment for individuals with lower limb phantom limb pain. Phantom pain severity, intensity, and interference were measured with visual analogue scales (collected twice weekly for the study's duration) and the Brief Pain Index (collected 4 total times across 12 weeks) using a single-subject, withdrawal design with three, 4-week study phases. Intervention consisted of twice weekly, 20-minute treatments for four weeks. Tailored treatments addressed individual phantom pain experience as if occurring on the corresponding, non-removed limb. Participants viewed treatment as though it were being applied to the amputated limb.  Specific Aim: Determine the extent to which massage therapy applied in combination with mirror therapy to the intact leg of an amputee addresses PLP severity, intensity, and interference.  Hypothesis: massage and mirror treatment session(s) focused on an intact limb will have acute and cumulative benefits (more pronounced and lasting) for PLP severity, intensity, and interference.  All study activity to occur on Indiana University's IUPUI campus.
Impact of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment on Pursuit Eye Movements in Healthy Human Adults The idea that osteopathic manipulative treatments (OMTs) should have an impact on the human visual system is not new. Nevertheless, there is a lack of scientific, objective, and experimental evidence. Our goal is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, controlled study to evaluate the effect of OMT on ocular pursuit. Eye movements will be measured by an infra-red video-based eye tracking system with a high spatial and temporal resolution. OMTs will be similar to regular treatments given by osteopaths in their daily practice. We hypothesize that OMT will improve the quality of ocular pursuit.

Determining the Feasibility of Implementing a Combined Cognitive and Exercise Training Program for Older Adults in a Community Setting. The overarching aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a proven cognitive training regimen in combination with a community exercise program among older adults who attend wellness exercise programs at the YMCA. To support this aim, the investigators have developed a collaboration with the YMCA of Kitchener-Waterloo, which offer exercise programs targeted to older adults. The specific objectives are: (1) to evaluate the feasibility of a combined exercise and cognitive training in a community-setting among older adults; and (2) to conduct a preliminary evaluation and comparison of changes in cognitive function, physical function, well-being and self-efficacy with 12-weeks of combined exercise and cognitive training versus exercise alone. The hypothesis for each objective are as follows: (1) It is anticipated that this program will be feasible to implement and will be well accepted by the participants and exercise providers. (2) The investigators may not have the power to find statistically significant differences between the control and experimental groups for physical and cognitive function. However, the investigators expect to observe positive changes between the pre- and post-assessments, suggesting improved cognitive function and mobility as a result of the 12-week program.

Comparison of 2 Methods to Achieve Tight Glucose Control in Cardiovascular ICU Patients There is current evidence that maintaining ICU patient's blood sugar between 4.4-6.1 saves lives. However, this is difficult to do in the ICU and carries risks of lowering the blood sugar too much. In addition, the best way to achieve this control is not known. Many strict nomograms that provide a standardized approach for nurses have been developed and validated, including one here at SMH. However, these nomograms cannot apply to all patients at all times, especially ICU patients whose needs are rapidly changing. ICU nurses are at the bedside constantly, are very familiar with their patient's needs, and have decades of experience in titrating medication doses without a nomogram to achieve a pre-determined response (i.e. medications to achieve pre-selected blood pressure). Indeed, once the bedside nurse has bought into the importance of the concept of tight glucose control and have been introduced to the nomogram here at SMH, their experience and intuition may be more adaptable to the changing needs of the patient than an inflexible paper nomogram. This study will compare glucose control using our current standard nomogram versus no nomogram (i.e. nurse directed) in order to determine whether the nomogram should continue to be used.
Cell Phone Intervention to Support Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Adherence in Kenya A clinical study to evaluate the use of cell phones to support drug adherence and follow-up of patients taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) for treatment of HIV.

Administration of Dexamethasone in PONV Prophylaxis in Children Undergoing Adenotomy Adenotomy, together with tonsillectomy, belongs among the most frequently performed surgical procedures in paediatric patients. These surgical procedures are associated with the second highest incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (following strabism correction surgery) in paediatric surgery. PONV is associated, apart from the discomfort for the child, with a number of complications: dehydration, metabolic disruption or danger of haemorrhage and aspiration of the gastric content. Adenotomy is a typologically completely different surgical procedure, with a different target structure of the surgery, and the length and invasiveness of the procedure. Thus, it is possible to expect a difference in PONV incidence when compared to tonsillectomy. Adenotomy is a surgical procedure performed namely in children of the pre-school age. This is associated, among others, also with the problem of objectivization of post-operative nausea, which is very difficult to verbalize in small children, being a subjective feeling of body discomfort. It is possible to expect that the overall incidence of PONV will be significantly underestimated.
Digital Versus Telephone Symptom Assessment and Triage in Primary Care A 'digital-first' approach is currently under implementation in several Swedish regions.  The principles behind implementing an online service as an access way to primary care are based on an expectation that it can make access easier, direct people to appropriate levels of care, and increase both availability of heath care and cost efficiency. However, a recent Swedish report concluded that digital triage in primary care has not been investigated in a clinical real-world setting, including real patients, meaning that the benefits and risks for patients as well as on a system level remain unclear.  The aim of this trial is to study the feasibility of a larger trial that will compare digital triage and traditional telephone triage on adherence to triaged health care level, in a randomized controlled study (feasibility study, RCT). The study will recruit a total of 120 patients, of which half will be randomized to telephone triage and half to digital triage.

Early PReserved SPONtaneous Breathing Activity in Mechanically Ventilated Patients With ARDS (PReSPON) The potential benefits of preserved early spontaneous breathing activity during mechanical ventilation are an increased aeration of dependent lung regions, less need for sedation, improved cardiac filling, and better matching of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and thus oxygenation. Two small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) reported less time on mechanical ventilation and in the intensive care unit (ICU) with preserved early spontaneous breathing activity during Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV).  Debate exists over the net effects of preserved early spontaneous breathing activity with regard to ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI). In fact, by taking advantage of the potential improvement in oxygenation and recruitment at lower inflation pressures associated with APRV, physicians could possibly reduce potentially harmful levels of inspired oxygen, tidal volume, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). However, spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation has the potential to generate less positive pleural pressures that may add to the alveolar stretch applied from the ventilator and contribute to the risk of VALI. This has led to an ongoing controversy whether an initial period of controlled mechanical ventilation with deep sedation and neuromuscular blockade or preserved early spontaneous breathing activity during mechanical ventilation is advantageous with respect to outcomes in ARDS patients.  A RCT investigating the effects of early spontaneous breathing activity on mortality in moderate to severe ARDS has been highly recommended in the research agenda for intensive care medicine.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preserved spontaneous breathing activity during APRV in the early phase of moderate to severe ARDS.

Hangover, Congeners, Sleep and Occupational Performance The objective is to investigate residual effects of heavy drinking, with or without hangover symptoms. The primary aim is to test several hypotheses about residual effects of heavy drinking. Hypotheses about how heavy drinking affects next-day performance include direct physiological effects of alcohol, alcohol withdrawal effects, and non-ethanol effects, such as congeners, or family history of alcohol problems. The investigators will test the following hypotheses:  1. relative to placebo, heavy drinking will degrade next-day performance, and this relationship will be mediated in full or in part by quality of sleep; 2. a high congener alcoholic beverage will affect performance to a greater degree than a low congener beverage and this relationship will be mediated by severity of hangover symptoms.

Mobile Application and Bladder Training The International Continence Society described overactive bladder as urine urgency, frequently accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency incontinence, when there is no evident pathology, such as a urinary tract infection. According to studies in the literature, women who have overactive bladders experience negative effects on their sexual satisfaction and quality of life. According to a study by Juliato et al. (2017), women with more severe urinary symptoms experienced higher degrees of arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and discomfort. According to Chuang et al. (2017) study, women's sexual pleasure and quality of life declined as urinary symptom intensity increased. It is believed that women's quality of life and levels of sexual satisfaction may be positively impacted by the training provided to lessen their symptoms, their follow-up, and their continuity. Additionally, it is anticipated that by encouraging better treatment compliance among women with OAB, hospital expenses will drop, which will benefit the national economy. In order to ascertain the impact of bladder training delivered via mobile application on quality of life and levels of sexual satisfaction in women with overactive bladder, this study was designed.  Between February 2023 and June 2024, this randomized controlled experimental design study will be conducted in the urogynecology clinic of a university hospital on Istanbul's Anatolian side. The sample size was determined via G-Power power analysis, and the groups were chosen using basic randomization. There will be 100 women studied, 50 in the study group (WG) and 50 in the control group (KG), all of whom have been diagnosed with overactive bladder. Through the smartphone application, WG women will receive bladder training, as well as follow-up care. Data will be gathered using the Quality of Life Scale, Sexual Satisfaction Scale, Mobile Application Usage Scales (only mobile application group), and Collection Form, Follow-Up Form. In the third and sixth months, new data will be collected on the Quality of Life Scale, Sexual Satisfaction Scale, and Mobile Application Usage Scales (just for the Mobile Application Group). There will be a data analysis.

Inhalation of Low Concentration of CO2 in Preterm Infants Not Responding to Caffeine for the Treatment of Apnea In premature infants, apnea of prematurity is one of their major clinical problems. Caffeine is currently a worldwide therapy to reduce the number and severity of these apneas. This practice has shown to be safe on cognitive and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 21 months of age. However, caffeine is not 100% effective, and may have little effect on hypoxemia and bradycardia. Infants with intractable apneas unresponsive to caffeine treatment may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. This procedure is invasive and has been associated with complications and increased risk for chronic lung disease and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. Therefore, an alternative treatment modality would be preferable if it would prevent the infants from requiring endotracheal intubation. The investigators have been testing the overall hypothesis that small concentrations of inhaled CO2 (\~1%) are effective in treating apnea of prematurity. The investigators have completed three studies in preterm infants showing that inhalation of low concentration of CO2, in infants not on caffeine, regularize breathing and decrease apneas significantly. The effects of inhalation of CO2 in infants already on caffeine, are unknown. The hypothesis to be tested is that inhalation of low concentration CO2 (1%) will significantly reduce apnea in infants treated with caffeine. The investigators have three specific aims in this proposal. 1) the investigators want to know if the apnea rate (number of apneas of ≥5 seconds/hour) is decreased with CO2 inhalation in preterm infants already on caffeine for the treatment of apnea of prematurity; 2) the investigators want to know whether inhalation of CO2 can make breathing more regular with less apneic time and whether it decreases prolonged apneas (\>20 seconds) in infants already on caffeine for the treatment of apnea of prematurity; 3) the investigators want to assess the effect of inhalation of low concentration of CO2 on the regional oxygen saturation of the brain measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during apneas. This is to see whether CO2, by protecting cerebral blood flow, minimizes the decrease in cerebral oxygenation during apneas. This study entails a new and possibly more physiological method of treating apneas of prematurity that can be added to the present treatment of caffeine. These two treatments together, could minimize the number and severity of apneas and possibly decrease the need for mechanical ventilation in preterm infants.

Resynchronization in Paced Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Indication Today patients with a Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) indication usually receive 2 ventricular leads, right ventricular (RV) apex and left ventricular (LV) (postero-) lateral, gaining a responder rate of approximately 70%. However, the physiological agitation of the left ventricle takes place over two pathways. Therefore single point stimulation might be insufficient for a dilated, insufficiently and asynchronously contracting left ventricle, resulting in either insufficient or no response to the therapy.  In the "CRT ICD Dual LV" study the patients receive a second LV lead in an anterior vein. When this lead is placed, temporary dual LV stimulation is started. To assess the effectivity of the dual LV lead stimulation intraoperatively a LV dp/dt-pressure measurement is taken. If there is an increase in LV dp/dt, the patients will be stimulated with both leads permanently. If not they will be stimulated conventionally.  The patients participating in this study are monitored for 12 months after implantation.

The Follow-up Study of Chronic Hepatitis B Patients With Liver Cirrhosis Receiving Anti-HBV Therapy Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, especially in the endemic area like Taiwan, where there are more than 3 million chronic hepatitis B carriers. Patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis, which may have disastrous complications, including hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver cirrhosis related complications accounts for the 8th leading cause of deaths in Taiwan; whereas, the HCC is the 2nd leading cause of deaths among all cancers. Therefore, it is prudent to develop strategies to prevent or halt the progression of liver cirrhosis.  For HBV patients who have already had cirrhosis, the main treatment objective is to reduce their risk of complications. A large-scale multicenter clinical trial showed that viral suppression using lamivudine in patients with advanced fibrosis effectively decreases the risk of HCC and liver-related complications. This study highlights the importance to treat HBV-related cirrhosis patients; however, several issues remain to be addressed.  The first issue is that this clinical trial only enrolled patients with positive HBeAg or HBV-DNA level \>1.4 x105 IU/mL. However, the current recommended threshold for cirrhotic patients to start anti-viral treatment is 2000 IU/mL. Whether anti-HBV therapy benefits cirrhotic patients in this level is still unclear. Second, lamivudine was used in this clinical trial; however, the high resistant rate of lamivudine during treatment probably lowers its protective effect against HCC. Whether a more potent anti-HBV agent with extremely low resistance profile, entecavir, is more beneficial to HBV-related cirrhotic patients is also unclear.  The Bureau of National Health Institute launched the reimbursement program for anti-HBV therapy since 2003 and extended this program to cirrhotic patients with HBV DNA level \> 2000 IU/mL for long-term use since Aug, 2010. Taking this advantage, we may explore the above-mentioned clinical questions more easily.  To address these issues, we will first retrospectively collect a cohort of HBV-related cirrhosis patients. All the patients will be enrolled from the time before oral anti-HBV therapy is widely used. We will determine their baseline serum HBV-DNA levels using the stored sera and enrolled those with baseline HBV-DNA levels higher than 2000 IU/mL as our historical controls. Second, we will enroll a retrospective cohort of HBV-related cirrhotic patients from 2008 who had HBV-DNA levels higher than 2000 IU/mL and received indefinite therapy of entecavir. By comparing these two cohorts, we will be able to clarify whether indefinite viral suppression by entecavir is beneficial for the cirrhotic patients.  With comprehensive analysis, we wish to document that re-setting the risk level of HBV DNA from 140,000 IU/mL to 2,000 IU/mL is more beneficial for HBV-related cirrhotic patients and long-term entecavir does lower the risk of HCC further. These lines of evidence will assist in delivering appropriate and more aggressive treatment for these high-risk patients.
Acute Exacerbation of COPD and Nebulized Magnesium Sulphate This study is designed to determine the effect of Nebulized Magnesium Sulphate as an add-on therapy with conventional treatment on In-hospital outcome in patients having acute exacerbation of COPD.
A Comparison of Arthrocentesis, Arthroscopy and Arthroplasty in the Treatment of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Many patients suffer from a disorder known as temporomandibular joint dysfunction. This disorder has jaw joint pain and limited function as key elements. Many treatments have been advocated over the last 40 years, many of them deleterious. Currently treatment can be divided into four categories. The first is non-surgical and involves vocal rest, soft diet, heat, anti-inflammatory medications, muscle relaxants, splint therapy and physical therapy. All patients benefit to some degree utilizing one or more non-surgical approaches. Controversy exists with respect to which of the next three categories of treatment is ideal. Some advocate arthrocentesis which involves placing two small needles into the joint to allow irrigation and instillation of anti-inflammatory medication. This is a minimally invasive procedure performed under local anesthetic alone or with intravenous sedation. Others advocate arthroscopy which involves placing an arthroscope (a thin tube about 2mm in diameter with optical elements allowing one to see inside a joint) to visualize the inside of a joint. Furthermore the joint can be irrigated, scar bands removed, ligaments stretched and medication instilled. This is performed under a general anesthesia. Depending on the study, success for both arthrocentesis and arthroscopy has been reported to be about 80-90%. Still there are others who recommend arthroplasty which is an open joint surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to enter the joint and directly repair or remove the damaged cartilage disc within the joint. This is performed under a general anesthesia. Similar success rates of 80-94% have been reported. It is clear that some patients only require arthrocentesis, others arthroscopy and others arthroplasty. We currently do not have any real mechanism of predicting which patients will benefit the most from which procedure.  This study will enable patients undergoing each procedure to be followed closely with the hope that we can determine objective factors that will allow us to stratify patients into one of the three surgical options: arthrocentesis, arthroscopy or arthroplasty. Our current approach is empiric and typically proceeds from arthrocentesis to arthroscopy to arthroplasty. All patients in this study will be offered the opportunity to have arthrocentesis performed. It is anticipated that a minority will achieve long-term benefit in terms of pain and function. We hope to be able to identify those factors which will predict which patients will benefit so that future patients selected to have arthrocentesis will have much higher success rates. Patients who fail to improve with arthrocentesis or who initially decline that procedure will be offered the opportunity to undergo arthroscopy. It is anticipated that a majority of patients will achieve long-term benefit in terms of pain and function. Again it is hoped that we can identify those factors which will predict which patients will benefit so that future patients selected to have arthroscopy will have even higher success rates. Patients who fail to improve with arthroscopy or who initially decline both arthrocentesis and arthroscopy will be offered the opportunity to undergo arthroplasty provided that clinical and radiographic evidence exists to support the presence of either a diseased or displaced cartilage disc.  Our ability to adequately treat patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction will be significantly improved if we can better stratify patients and follow an evidence based surgical algorithm that provides the greatest opportunity for success while reducing potential complications. Each of these surgical procedures is the standard of care throughout the USA but unfortunately the choice of which procedure to perform is often empiric and guided more by training and surgical experience.
Optimal Analgesia for Forefoot Surgery A randomised trial comparing three analgesic strategies for patients undergoing forefoot surgery in a day-surgery setting.
A Study of Communication Between Clinicians, Patients, and Families in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) The purpose of this study is to investigate a specific approach to patient care called a time-limited trial (TLT). This approach is sometimes used for people who develop critical illness and are cared for in an intensive care unit (ICU). A time-limited trial is a plan made together by medical teams, patients with critical illness (if they can take part), and their families or other important people helping to make their healthcare decisions. A time-limited trial starts with a discussion of the patient's goals and wishes. Then, a plan is made to use ICU treatments for a set period of time to give the patient the chance to recover. After this time, the patient's response to treatment will be reviewed to help guide what to do next.  Medical teams consider this kind of plan when it is not clear if a patient can recover to a quality of life that is acceptable to him or her. With a time-limited trial, patients, families, and medical teams experience this uncertainty together.  The main goal of this study is to find the best way to use TLTs for patients in the ICU who have trouble breathing and need mechanical ventilation to help them breathe. The hypothesis is that optimal time-limited trial delivery will reduce the time patients with acute respiratory failure spend in the ICU and will improve the intensive care unit experiences for their families and clinicians.
A Phase 2 Study of Isatuximab in Combination With Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone Followed by Isatuximab and Lenalidomide Maintenance in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Severe Renal Impairment This is an Investigator-Initiated, phase 2, prospective, open-label study designed to be conducted in six hospitals in Greece.  Eligible patients will initially receive an induction phase of six 28-day cycles of isatuximab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCd), followed by a maintenance phase with isatuximab and lenalidomide until disease progression, death, unacceptable adverse events, lost to follow up, or consent withdrawal, whichever occurs first. The study will last for approximately 36 months (follow-up period), starting from the date of the first patient in, to the date of the last patient last visit.  The primary objective is to assess the effect of induction treatment with isatuximab in combination with VCd on the renal function of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma and severe renal impairment (RI).  The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of isatuximab in combination with VCd, followed by lenalidomide maintenance on: Overall response rate, Progression-Free Survival, Time to Response, Duration of Response, Overall Survival, Minimal Residual Disease negativity rate, Safety

Potential Predictive Biomarkers in Patients Undergoing First-line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Chemoresistance remains an obstacle in treating people with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with mCRC receiving chemotherapy may help doctors understand the effect of chemotherapy on biomarkers. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate biomarkers in chemotherapy regimens for first-line chemotherapy for mCRC.
Characteristics That Identify Exacerbation Risk Following Colds in COPD Patients Respiratory virus infections are a common cause of COPD exacerbations and antiviral therapies have potential as treatments for exacerbations. However it is likely that treating patients when they present with an exacerbation with antiviral drugs will be too late to be effective and earlier treatment at the time of the initial upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) will be required. The incidence of exacerbations following URTIs in COPD patients, and whether there are host factors and biomarkers that can identify the risk of this, is unknown. The aims of this study are to establish the proportion of viral URTIs that progress to an acute exacerbation in COPD patients and identify clinical, viral and biological markers that predict risk of an exacerbation following an URTI. In addition we will determine the frequency of, and risk factors for, bacterial infection following viral URTIs in COPD patients. This data will permit development of a model combining baseline patient characteristics, clinical measurements and biomarkers to predict exacerbation risk following viral URTI in COPD patients. The results will open the way for trials of antiviral therapy in COPD exacerbations and targeting of treatment to high risk patients.
Emergent Microsurgical Intervention in Acute Stroke Patients After Mechanical Thrombectomy Failure Trial With all of the gains that have been achieved with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy revascularization and intravenous thrombolysis logistics, there is still a subgroup of patients with salvageable brain tissue for whom persistent emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) portends a catastrophic outcome. Study aims to test the safety and efficacy of emergent microsurgical intervention in acute ischemic stroke patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery occlusion after failure of mechanical thrombectomy.

The Dose of Radioactive Iodine Needed to Ablate the Thyroid Remnant Left Behind After Thyroidectomy The thyroid cells take up iodine, and radioactive iodine is commonly used to irradiate residual thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer following surgical removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). A whole body radioactive iodine scanning is usually carried out after thyroidectomy to assess the amount of thyroid tissue left behind at surgery (that might still contain cancer), and to evaluate the presence of iodine avid lesions elsewhere in the body (that might be cancer metastases). A large dose of radioactive iodine is often given, still the optimal iodine dose to ablate the thyroid remnant after surgery is not known. In this study, two radioactive iodine doses are compared in the ablation of the thyroid remnant, a smaller (1110 MBq) dose and a larger (3700 MBq) dose. The study participants are randomly allocated using a 1:1 ratio to receive either the smaller or the larger radioactive iodine dose. These treatments are compared for safety, adverse effects, and the need for subsequent repeat treatments. The individual absorbed radiation doses are measured. The study hypothesis is that fewer repeat radioiodine treatments might be needed after the larger dose, but the larger dose might be associated with a higher frequency of adverse events.
Prevention of Posttraumatic Osteoarthritis After Acute Intraarticular Fractures Intra-articular fracture is a very common fracture. The only method to treat these fractures is surgery with plate and screws followed by rehabilitation. Even though the surgeons do their best to restore the anatomy, up to 40 percent of the patients develop osteoarthritis after 10 years. Previous research has shown that immediately after fracture in the joint, the body starts an inflammatory response and activates a series of biomarkers inside the joint space. Some of these biomarkers are believed to break down the cartilage resulting in development of osteoarthritis, despite surgical treatment. Currently it is still unknown, which biomarkers are activated in the joint space, and how we can stop their deleterious action in order to prevent cartilage degradation.  The purpose of this project is to identify the biomarkers in the joint space after an intra-articular ankle fracture and to evaluate how these biomarkers affect the short- and mid-terms clinical outcomes. As secondary outcomes we evaluate how fracture classification and fracture reduction affect clinical outcomes and physical activity after surgery.
The Effect of Dietary Fat Load and Physical Exercise on the Flexibility and Partitioning of Ectopic Lipids. This study aims at assessing the effect of standardized dietary fat load and short-term aerobic exercise on systemic lipolysis, flexibility and partitioning of ectopic fat stores (intramyocellular = IMCL, intrahepatocellular = IHCL, intramyocardial lipids = IMCaL) in relation to FFA in endurance trained athletes and hypopituitary patients compared to sedentary healthy control subjects.  Exercise is a powerful stimulation for growth hormone (GH) secretion in health. A standardised exercise test can, therefore, be discriminative for the diagnosis of GH-deficiency in adults. This will be assessed.  Hypothesis (ectopic fat stores)  1. Ectopic fats stores are flexible fuel stores and are influenced by diet and physical activity.FFA availability may play an important regulatory role. 2. There is a tissue specific partitioning of triglycerides and/or FFA among non-adipose organs after fat load and physical exercise 3. The flexibility of ectopic fat stores is related to insulin sensitivity 4. Lipolytic and anti-lipolytic hormones are critical for regulating FFA availability (at rest or during exercise) and therefore also for the regulation of ectopic fat stores. 5. GH is a lipolytica hormone. Lack of GH in adulthood is related to decreased FFA availability thereby influencing ectopic lipid stores Hypothesis diagnosis of GHD 6. A short intensive physical exercise shows a good discriminative power to diagnose GHD.

Sorafenib and TRC105 in Hepatocellular Cancer Background:  Sorafenib is a drug that has been approved to treat kidney and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC) and has been shown to prolong survival in patients with HCC. It works by slowing the spread of cancer cells, but it does not fully prevent the cancer from growing again. Researchers are interested in combining sorafenib with the experimental drug TRC105, which has been designed to block the growth of blood vessels that lead to tumor growth, in order to determine whether this drug combination stops tumor growth and reduces tumor size better than sorafenib alone.  Objectives:  To determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of sorafenib and TRC105 as a treatment for hepatocellular cancer that has not responded to other treatments.  Eligibility:  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer that has not responded to other treatments, and who are not considered to be candidates for liver transplantation. Patients cannot be receiving anticoagulant therapy with the exception of low dose aspirin. No history of bleeding problems or peptic ulcer disease.  Design:  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will have a tumor biopsy or provide previously collected tumor tissue for study. An examination of the esophagus to look for problems with blood vessels will be completed in patients with a history of cirrhosis.  Participants will receive sorafenib tablets twice every day, in the morning and at night, with a full glass of water.  Participants will receive TRC 105 infusions once every two weeks on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle.  At each visit during the first cycle, participants will have a physical examination and blood tests. Participants will continue to have blood tests and a urine test every cycle to monitor the effects of treatment, including tests of kidney function. Participants will have imaging studies after every two cycles to evaluate the results of treatment, and may also provide tumor samples for study.  Treatment will continue as long as the tumor does not grow and side effects remain tolerable.

Immunogenicity:  * To obtain data on the antibody response to a single subcutaneous vaccination with ChimeriVax™-JE, at three dose levels, in healthy adult volunteers without prior Japanese encephalitis immunity. * To assess the durability of immune response up to 12 months following a single subcutaneous vaccination with ChimeriVax™-JE, at three dose levels.
Tension Versus Tension- Free Foley Balloon for Cervical Ripening Foley balloons are commonly used as a mechanical method of cervical ripening for induction of labor. Foley balloons may be placed either under tension or without tension (tension-free). The purpose of our study is to examine time to delivery in nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor who have a Foley balloon placed as a mechanical cervical dilator, assigned to either tension or without tension. The goal is to determine if there is a potential added benefit to placing the Foley balloon on tension as compared to no tension. Our hypothesis is that Foley balloon under tension for cervical ripening results in shorter time to vaginal delivery compared to Foley balloon placed without tension.

PGE2/IL-22 Pathway in Various Forms of Eczema Objectives: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterised immunologically by T cellmediated inflammation. The pathogenic mechanisms involved in its development are incompletely understood and targeted treatment options are limited. The investigators will study the Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/IL22/IL17 pathway which plays an important role in murine model chronic skin inflammation. The investigators wish to identify subtypes of human eczema in which this pathway may be involved and to determine whether manipulation of this pathway may offer effective new treatments.  Design, tissue/cells, techniques and measurements: To address these objectives, the investigators will measure the expression of IL22, IL17A and PGE2 synthases and receptors in skin biopsies from eczema and psoriasis patients using immunohistochemistry (confirming this with RT-PCR). IL22/IL17 producing Tcells (from peripheral blood) and their skin-homing capability (by ex-vivo cell culture and flow cytometry) will be measured. Deriving immune cells from skin biopsies using Villanova's technique1, the investigators will determine the T-cell response to PGE2 looking at PGE2 receptors and cytokine expression, interrogating these cells by flow cytometry. To determine the sequence and kinetics of activation of the PGE2/IL22/IL17 pathway the investigators will measure each immune mediator at specific time points by recruiting healthy volunteers inducing irritant and allergic contact dermatitis using dithranol and DNCB respectively. The investigators will repeat the experiment dividing volunteers into two arms, one pre-treated for one week with a non-specific prostaglandin inhibitor (aspirin) and the second with a placebo control.
Olaparib Monotherapy and Olaparib + Pembrolizumab Combination Therapy for Ovarian Cancer To evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative olaparib monotherapy and preoperative olaparib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy in patients with untreated stage III, IV high-grade serous or Grade 3 endometrioid ovarian cancer with Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) positivity.
The Effect of Tactile Deficit on Motor Function in Unilateral Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy(CP) is the most common cause of disability in childhood. The motor spectrum of disorders is characterized by abnormal muscle tone, posture, and movement. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition and behavior. Besides classical appearance of symptomatology, tactile impairment takes an important place to be evaluated. Assessment of the integrity of tactile function composes of two main steps: tactile registration and tactile perception. Our main goal is the define the effect of tactile impairment on hand motor function with the usage of identical assessment tools in patients with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP) and typically developed children (TDC).
Vietnam Era Health Retrospective Observational Study The Vietnam Era Health Retrospective Observational Study (VE-HEROeS) is a national study on the health and well-being of Vietnam Veterans, including Blue Water Navy Veterans, as well as Veterans who served elsewhere during the Vietnam Era (1961-1975), and similarly aged U.S. residents who never served in the military. The investigators will invite approximately 43,000 Vietnam and Vietnam Era Veterans, and approximately 11,000 members of the general U.S. population to participate in VE-HEROeS. These individuals are scientifically selected to participate; the study is not able to accept volunteers.  All participants in VE-HEROeS will be asked to fill out a questionnaire on their military service, general health, age-related conditions, health care use, and the health experiences of their children and grandchildren. A smaller group will be asked to provide the investigators with access to some of their medical records. Topics of special focus for the study include cognition, hepatitis C infection, and neurologic conditions.
Abiraterone Acetate Trial in African American Prostate Cancer Patients This is a pilot study of abiraterone acetate in African American/Black patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. The primary objective is to determine the correlation between germline polymorphisms and antitumor activity (as defined by a decline in PSA of ≥ 30%) in African American patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone acetate. Patients will receive abiraterone acetate until the time of disease progression, in the absence of prohibitive toxicities. Patients will be followed for disease progression and survival.
Forearm vs Brachial Plexus Blockade for Routine Hand and Wrist Surgery It is very common to perform nerve blocks for hand and wrist surgery. It allows the surgeon to perform the surgery and helps with pain control after surgery. This also means only light sedation is needed for the procedure instead of a general anesthetic, which speeds up recovery time.  There are 2 types of nerve blocks that can be done for hand and/or wrist surgery. The one that is done commonly now is where the whole arm is frozen with local anesthetic. Another option is to have a nerve block where only the arm from the elbow down is frozen. Either of these types of nerve blocks can be chosen to safely accomplish surgery of the hand or wrist. However, the best nerve block for hand and/or wrist surgery has not been decided yet.  In order to determine which block is best, the investigators will be looking at patient satisfaction with the experience, as well as the surgical conditions provided and overall safety.  It is thought that many patients may prefer the arm block below the elbow as it allows for greater mobility immediately following surgery, and the surgical conditions provided will be very similar to those of the full arm nerve block.
Viral and Microbial Circulation Between Humans, Domesticated and Wild Animals Along an Ecotone, Democratic Republic of Congo This study will evaluate the overlap between the intestinal microbiome and virome of wild and domesticated animals and human beings living in close proximity in three sites along an ecotone (ecological gradient) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Does a Perioperative Course of Gabapentin Improve Analgesia After Cesarean Delivery? Gabapentin has been very effective at treating pain after knee and hip operations, hysterectomies, and many other types of operations. A previous study at the investigators' hospital found that a single pre-operative dose of 600mg gabapentin produced a significant reduction in pain after cesarean section. However, 19% of patients complained of sedation. A subsequent study at the same institution looked to see if lowering the dose to 300mg would decrease pain scores whilst reducing the sedative side-effect seen in the first trial. The results were inconclusive but it provided valuable information to guide the design of this study.  The purpose of this study is to see whether a preoperative dose of gabapentin, followed by a 48 hour low-dose course will produce improvement in pain scores. This study will compare the efficacy of a peri-operative course of gabapentin (600mg one hour before the operation and 200mg every 8 hours for 2 days post-operatively) and a similar course of placebo in women undergoing Cesarean section. The investigators' hypothesis is that a course of gabapentin will result in decreased pain scores and increased satisfaction.

Prospective Cohort Study of Liver Cancer Patients Treated With Proton Beam Therapy Liver cancer is the fourth most common malignant tumor in Korea and it is the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide according to the 2009 Korea Central Cancer Registration Annual Report. Excellent survival rate (50-70% 5-year survival rate) can be obtained when surgery is performed including liver transplantation, but most (70-80%) patients with liver cancer are difficult to get surgery due to liver disease associated with cirrhosis. In addition, due to the multi-centric nature of liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis, repeated treatment is required. For these reasons, various treatments for liver cancer (percutaneous arterial embolization, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency heat therapy, and radiation therapy) have been performed.  Due to recent advances in radiotherapy technology, proton beam therapy (PBT) is a promising treatment for liver cancer because it maximizes radiation to tumor tissues and reduces radiation doses from surrounding normal tissues due to the distinct physical properties of proton beams. Promising therapeutic results and less toxicity have been reported in liver cancer. In addition, several genes in liver cancer (SOCS-1, GSTP, APC, VEGF, PD-EGF, HIF-1, NOS, b-FGF, LINE-1, p27, TOP2A, Ets-1, Bcl-xL, Osteopontin, CD44, etc.) have been reported to be associated with recurrence and prognosis.

Effect of Balanced Hypocaloric Diet Associated With Supplementation of Eggplant Meal in the Remission of Cardiovascular Risk Factors Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevail as the main cause of death in developed and developing countries and are among the most frequent causes of disabilities in Brazil and in the world.  Economic alternatives have been studied to assist in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Within this context, the Solanum menogena, whose fruit known as eggplant is widely consumed in Brazil, is being used in alternative medicine with the purpose to reduce the concentrations of cholesterol, glucose and promote loss of body weight.  Aubergine (eggplant) stands out for its high fibre content (approximately 40%) and low fat content. In addition, it is popularly known for its functional properties, aiding in reducing the risk of coronary diseases. The purplish coloring of the eggplant peel is attributed to the large amount of flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties and contribute to the flavor of eggplant.  The investigators hypothesis is that the eggplant flour associated with a restricted calorie diet has effect in reduction in waist circumference, reduction of body fat and increasing HDL-cholesterol; this way, contributing to the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors  All participants will be informed about the research and they will have to sign a consent form. The volunteers will be divided into two groups: one group will receive a restricted-calorie diet and supplementation with eggplant flour; and the other will receive a diet plus a placebo for 120 days, being both groups evaluated monthly. In each consultation, evaluation of weight, body composition, fulfillment of the diet and blood pressure measurement will be performed. In addition, blood will also be collected in order to determine glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, oxidized anti-LDL antibodies, 15-isoprostane and minerals (selenium, zinc, iron, manganese, magnesium and copper). The results will be analyzed by statistical program.  The investigators expect that with the results obtained, the eggplant flour can be used as an ally in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
Hemodynamic Resuscitation and Monitoring in Early Sepsis "Hemodynamic Resuscitation and Monitoring in Early Sepsis (HERMES Study)" involves recording of patient's medical data related to that has been collected as part of his/her routine medical care in ICU.  Presently there is no data from Indian ICUs on the way patients in early sepsis are resuscitated and monitored. There may exist a wide variation in clinical practice. The investigators would like to conduct an observational study in various levels of Indian ICUs, to prospectively collect data on adult patients admitted to ICU with early sepsis in a 60-day window period. Investigator would like to study the hemodynamic resuscitation and monitoring performed in these patients. In addition, Investigator would like to identify factors associated with improved outcomes and achieving the goals of the sepsis bundles in one, three and six hours.  The objectives of the study is to capture the patient characteristics and hemodynamic resuscitation and monitoring practices in patients presenting with early sepsis and hypotension to Indian ICUs  Investigator plan to recruit 50 -100 centers nationwide. Each center will be asked to collect data from at least 10 patients in a maximum time window of 60 days. A convenience sample of minimum 500 patients presenting to ICU with suspected sepsis and hypotension will be taken.  Each Centre will guarantee the integrity of data collection and ensure timely completion of the case record forms. Each center will select a 60 day window period for patient recruitment. The start date may be anytime any time between 1st August to 15th October 2019. Therefore, the recruitment window period will end for a respective centre, anytime between 30th September and 14th December 2019, depending on the start date. All consecutive patients in the 60-day period will be screened and those eligible will be enrolled.  This is an ISCCM(Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine) Research Committee funded study. The ISCCM will fund the Principal Investigator for all expenses related software development, website hosting, secretarial assistance and miscellaneous expenses related to the conduct of the study, data analysis and publication. No funding will be given to the investigators from the various participating centers for contributing data.
Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block in Septorhinoplasty Septorhinoplasty is a widely performed surgery that aims to correct both functional and aesthetic problems of the nose. Despite its expected clinical benefits, septorhinoplasty surgery causes postoperative pain, which affects the patient's functional recovery and satisfaction. Opioids, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAII), acetaminophen and local anesthetics are used in peroperative pain management in septorhinoplasty. Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB), which has been recently described and has different application areas, is a regional analgesia technique that has been investigated for this purpose. Although there are studies on postoperative pain in septorhinoplasty surgeries, there are not enough studies on its effects on intraoperative pain.  This study may have positive effects on appropriate pain management, patient comfort and surgical outcomes as multimodal analgesia management in septorhinoplasty surgeries, and may make significant contributions to evidence-based practices.
Blood Sample Measurements and Physical Activity Levels in Type II Diabetes and/or COVID-19 It is known that COVID-19 has a more negative clinical course and causes higher degrees of morbidity and mortality in case of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. However, the contribution of COVID-19 to hyperglycemia and its effect on glycemic parameters are uncertain. However, it is important to investigate homocysteine and lipid profile levels, respectively, and free radical levels known to be effective in the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes due to oxidative stress, which can provide information about the identification and diagnosis of cardiovascular complications in the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, as the decrease in physical activity levels of individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic may cause possible secondary complications such as an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, determining the physical activity levels of individuals and encouraging them to physical activity is another important parameter to minimize the negative effects of the process. Patients who applied to Izmir Bakircay University Cigli Training and Research Hospital (Cigli Regional Education Hospital) and hospitalized in the COVID-19 service and healthy controls are planning to include in this study. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be included in Group I (n: 20), patients diagnosed with both Type II Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 will be included in Group II (n: 20) and healthy controls will be included in Group III (n:20). Hemoglobin A1c levels, lipid profiles, homocysteine, free radical levels and physical activity levels will be compared between groups. In addition, the change in the relevant variables before and after COVID-19 treatment will be determined by in-group comparisons in Group I and Group II. This study, which has a prospective and randomized controlled research plan, is planned to be carried out between January and February 2021. Research data will be obtained from blood samples taken from participants. In addition, data on physical activity levels will be collected through a questionnaire. After analyzing the data obtained from the research with appropriate statistical methods, the data will be evaluated.
Association Between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Bulimia Nervosa in Outpatients With Eating Disorders To understand whether a relationship exists between eating disorders and ADHD, we seek to clarify the prevalence of ADHD in individuals with eating disorders. To this end, we will estimate the prevalence of ADHD, and other neuropsychiatric disorders, in outpatients with history of an eating disorder diagnosis. Secondarily, we will identify patterns of cognitive deficits in outpatients with history of an eating disorder diagnosis. We will also examine whether ADHD in this population is associated with functional and familial correlates associated with ADHD.
Total Versus Subtotal Thyroidectomy in Graves' Disease At AUH The main aim of work is to compare between subtotal and total thyroidectomy intra and postoperatively to identify which technique is better for patient of graves disease
ORAL ANTIDIABETICS EFFECT ON VISCERAL FAT Weight control is an essential part of treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Weight loss is associated with decreased haemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels. In particular, visceral fat is accompanied by more alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism. Quantification of visceral fat with bioimpedance (BIA) is closely related to measurement with computed axial tomography. Different available oral antidiabetics cause weight loss and total body fat (biguanides, DPP-4 inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors), but it has only been shown that SLGT2 inhibitors decrease visceral fat. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in the amount of visceral fat measured with BIA in T2D patients between three oral antidiabetic regimens after twelve weeks of treatment, to compare the effect on visceral fat between metformin, DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors.
Impact of Severe Hepatic Impairment on Pharmacokinetics of Cenicriviroc and Its Metabolites The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability profiles of cenicriviroc (CVC) and its metabolites (M-I and M-II) in participants with severely impaired hepatic function compared with matched healthy participants following single-dose administration
Genomics in Heart Transplants A cross-sectional analysis of 200 heart transplant recipients, combining in-depth phenotyping and risk factor assessment (cardiac MRI, coronary angiogram with OCT, cardiorespiratory exercise tests, exogenic factors like nutrition, smoking, lipid profile) with short-read whole-genome sequencing to elucidate the interplay of established PRS from the literature and exogenic risk factors with respect to HTx outcomes will be carried out.  Besides that, a long-read whole-genome sequencing of 100 newly transplanted recipients and their corresponding donors and extend latest bioinformatics methods developed by the study to analyze long-read data will be performed. This will enable a comprehensive and integrated analysis of structural variants, polygenic risk, high-penetrance variant genotypes, immunogenetic (major and minor histocompatibility), and individual lifestyle risk factors in a unique donor-recipient cohort, elucidating the extent of within-cohort variability and cross-correlations between the considered potential risk factors and an exploratory analysis of the utility of genetic risk scores in light of the study results will be carried out.
Efficacy Study of Antiemetics to Reduce Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting We randomized patients who received laparoscopic surgery for benign gynecologic disease into double dose (Experimental Group) or single dose (Control Group) of antiemetics. We compared the degree of postoperative nausea and vomiting in experimental and control groups.
Platelet Aggregation in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease and Kidney Dysfunction Taking Clopidogrel or Ticagrelor About 35% of patients hospitalized with Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) have some degree of renal dysfunction. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not only associated to worse prognosis in ACS patients, but leads also to an increased risk of bleeding, which may importantly influence the risk-benefit ratio of antiplatelet therapy in this population. The responsible mechanisms for increased rate of ischemic events in this population are not completely elucidated.  Antiplatelet therapy is of paramount importance in the treatment of ACS, but its benefit in CKD patients is not well established. This population is often excluded or underrepresented in large clinical trials, and the indication of antiplatelet therapy is often extrapolated from studies in patients with preserved renal function. In recent meta-analysis, Palmer et al. sought to evaluate the benefits and risks of antiplatelet agents in patients with CKD and concluded that in patients with ACS or scheduled for angioplasty already taking aspirin, the addition of clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitors have little or no impact in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction, death or need for revascularization.  In the PLATO trial, ticagrelor (a new reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 receptor with faster onset of action and greater platelet inhibition) was compared to clopidogrel in patients with high risk ACS and was associated to a 16% risk reduction on the occurrence of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In a pre-specified sub-analysis, data from patients with CKD were compared to those obtained from the population with normal renal function and suggests that the benefit of ticagrelor may be even greater in patients with CKD. Two hypotheses were considered to explain these results:  1. Greater and more consistent platelet inhibition achieved with ticagrelor would be more effective in reducing ischemic events in this population at increased thrombotic risk; 2. Pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor besides inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor. Ticagrelor might be associated with an elevation in serum levels of adenosine. This could improve myocardial perfusion through coronary vasodilation, and this effect would be more pronounced in patients with renal dysfunction.  This project aims to validate (or not) these hypotheses, analyzing platelet aggregation and circulating adenosine levels in patients taking dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor.
A Study of Tarceva (Erlotinib) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Who Present EGFR Mutations This single arm, open-label study will assess the efficacy and safety of Tarceva (erlotinib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Patients will receive Tarceva at a dose of 150 mg daily orally until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
ATR Inhibitor Elimusertib (BAY1895344) Plus Niraparib Phase 1b Study in Advanced Solid Tumors and Ovarian Cancer The purpose of the study is to test how well patients with advanced solid tumors and ovarian cancer respond to treatment with elimusertib in combination with niraparib. In addition researchers want to find for patients the optimal dose of elimusertib in combination with niraparib, how the drug is tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and discharges the drug. The study medication elimusertib works by blocking a substance produced by the body (ATR Kinase) which is important for the growth of tumor cells. Niraparib works by blocking a substance produced by the body (PARP enzymes) in a way that tumor cells can be killed, or made more susceptible to chemotherapy.

Extrapyramidal Side-Effects in Antipsychotic Drug Therapeutics The project is aimed at addressing the fundamental issue in antipsychotic therapeutics -the balance between mental state benefits and neurological risks.The latter cannot be overestimated and clinical skills in themselves are inadequately sensitive to refine practice. With all current and "pipeline" antipsychotics based on central dopamine blockade, there is little prospect that therapeutics can be improved by advances in pharmacology alone.  The project uses, for the first time, technology that is not only simple, real-life and user-friendly but "modern" and socially held in high regards. The proposal depends on patients receiving antipsychotic medication where clinically indicated. At all times, subjects will receive clinically-indicated therapy. The major ethical issue will relate to the issue of informed consent in those suffering from major psychiatric disorder. This is a routine consideration in psychiatric practice and the investigators will seek guidance on this from the Consultant Psychiatrist responsible for potential participants and would not proceed with initial approaches in cases of doubt or absence of capacity.  This is a pilot/feasibility study with no intention to utilise the data for commercialisation of the device or to expand the CE (Conformité Européenne) marking.
The CARMA Technique Study Colonoscopic removal of polyps is an important and well-established tool in the prevention of colorectal cancers. However, high polyp recurrence rates after endoscopic resection, with resultant development of interval cancers, remains a problem; this most commonly stems from unrecognised incomplete polyp resection. Thus, a standardised endoscopic technique is needed that will allow endoscopists to consistently achieve a clear margin of resection. The investigators believe the Cap Assisted Resection Margin Assessment (CARMA) technique will address this problem. This novel technique focuses on a standardised assessment of the resection margin after endoscopic polypectomy utilising available standard high-definition video endoscopes with imaging features including narrow band imaging (NBI) and magnification endoscopy.
Safety and Effectiveness Study of Chemotherapy in Combination With Erlotinib,or Sequential Erlotinib for Treatment in Patients With NSCLC The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare safety and effectiveness of Chemotherapy in Combination With Erlotinib,or Sequential Erlotinib for Treatment in Patients With EGFR - TKI Resistance of EGFR Mutations
Intraoperative Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Angiography in Colorectal Surgery to Prevent Anastomotic Leakage Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and the third in France. Its incidence is steadily rising in developing nations. Anastomotic leak (AL) is a major problem in colorectal surgery affecting at least 7% of patients operated on for left colonic cancer. It is the most feared complication after colorectal anastomosis, associated with mortality, prolonged hospitalization, impaired health related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased health care costs. Intraoperative fluorescence angiography (IOFA) with indocyanine green (ICG) may help preventing AL. Available studies on the effects of IOFA with ICG are heterogeneous and randomized controlled trial are scarce. Our aim is to demonstrate that IOFA with ICG could lead to a reduction of AL rate after left-sided or low anterior resection with anastomosis for CRC.  The FLUOCOL-1 study is the first national, multicenter, single blind, randomized, 2-arm, phase III superiority clinical trial. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of an AL 90 days post-operation. AL is defined as any anastomotic dehiscence with leakage into the pelvic cavity diagnosed upon imaging or at surgical exploration or any isolated pelvic organ-space infection with no evidence of fistula as defined by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer.  The study population will be made of adult patients with left-sided or high rectal cancer scheduled to undergo elective left colectomy or high rectal resection (by open, laparoscopy or robotic surgery) and with expected stapled or hand-sewn intraperitoneal anastomosis. The exclusion criteria are mainly an emergent surgery; rectal cancer requiring total mesorectal excision and anastomosis expected below the peritoneal reflection; CRC requiring total or subtotal colectomy; CRC requiring transverse colectomy; recurrent CRC and locally advanced colorectal cancer requiring multi-visceral excision.  A total of 1010 patients will be necessary (39 patients in each centre during 36 months). An interim analysis for efficacy and futility is scheduled when half of the participants will have been recruited.  In case of positive results favoring IOFA, this study would define the use of IOFA as a standard of care in colorectal surgery. At the patient level, a significantly lower rate of AL will reduce hospital stay and stoma rate, and will ensure improved postoperative recovery, faster return to normal activity and better long-term oncologic outcomes.
Correlation of Carotid Flow Time and Cardiac Output. Assessment of common carotid artery flow is more easily done and can be taught more broadly than transthoracic echocardiography, providing a greater number of clinicians a tool to assess volume responsiveness. These assessments are of great importance to patients with COVID-19, who often present with hypotension requiring fluids, which must be balanced against limiting fluid administration to minimize pulmonary edema.
Patient Satisfaction With the Management of a Stopped Pregnancy in the First Trimester The clinical practice recommendations highlight the fact that the patient's choice concerning the management of her aborted pregnancy in the first trimester should be privileged, after clear and appropriate information on the available treatments, in order to improve his experience and reduce the negative psychological symptoms that can generate an alteration in the quality of life, in the aftermath of the loss of pregnancy.  The present study will describe the efficacy, satisfaction and tolerance of patients benefiting from medical treatment with Mifégyne® and MisoOne® versus those benefiting from surgical treatment by endo-uterine aspiration for the management of a pregnancy stopped during the first trimester at the Toulouse University Hospital

Leukotrienes Pathway in Chinese Children With Sleep-disordered Breathing Our goals are to demonstrate an active leukotrienes (LTs) mediated inflammatory response is involved in pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and to provide a theoretical evidence for LTs modify therapy in treating pediatric patients with SDB.  The investigators have hypothesized that the pathophysiology of pediatric SDB involves specific systemic and local upper airway inflammatory response mediated by LTs.  1. LT concentration assays reveal higher levels in serum for both leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and in morning urine for LTE4 of SDB children, in comparison to healthy ones, and LTs productions emerge disease severity-dependent increases.     There is a positive correlation between LTs production and other systemic markers such as neutrophil counts and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP). 2. Children with SDB have higher leukotriene receptor-1 (LT1-R) and leukotriene receptor-2 (LT2-R) expressions in adenotonsillar tissues of SDB children compared to recurrent infectious tonsillitis subjects. 3. Levels of LTs are positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) z-score, waist height ratio (WHtR), adenotonsillar size and polysomnography (PSG) indices including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive apnea index (OAI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), arousal index, percentage of time spend saturation lower than 90% (SLT90%) and negatively correlated with mean and minimal pulse oximetric saturation (SpO2), which indicates synergistic role of obesity and hypoxia are the determinants of LTs production in SDB. 4. In adenotonsillar mixed cell culture system, the addition of LTs can increase cellular proliferation rates and exhibit dose-dependent responses, whereas leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) elicit dose-dependent cellular reductions.
Effects of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field on Autonomic Function in Patients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Previously it has been demonstrated that exposing the heart to electromagnetic field during exercise stress test improves the recovery following the stress test. This is explained by the effect of the electromagnetic field on the sympathetic activity of the heart. In the present study we would like to further investigate the effects of electromagnetic field on autonomic nervous system function in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain that usually have high sympathetic activity. Each patient will be exposed to 20 minutes of electromagnetic field during which the autonomic nervous system function will be measured. In addition, patient tolerability to the exposed magnetic field will be investigated. We assume that short exposure to electromagnetic field would result in decreased sympathetic activity and therefore, on the long run, could be suggested as a therapeutic tool for such patients.

Feasibility of an Interactive Tablet-based Exercise Program for People With Chronical Diseases End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a potential outcome of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) that requires renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation.Despite the encouraging benefits seen in PHD who exercised, they may be confronted with more barriers to start and maintain an exercise program than healthy persons, e.g. due to reduced accessibility of specialised physiotherapists. Telerehabilitation (TR), a subfield of telemedicine, may help to overcome some of the barriers to exercise regularly and connect PHD with specialised physiotherapists. The primary objective of this study is to determine feasibility of this TR exercise approach in preparation of a future RCT. Focus of the study is recruitment, attrition and adherence to the intervention, data collection methods and acceptability/satisfaction of the intervention.  The secondary objectives are to evaluate potential impacts of this intervention approach on physical function and health-related disability and quality of life. The study intervention is an interactive tablet-based home exercise program. The program is called "Dividat Fit" and works interactive, meaning that the responsible specialised Physiotherapist (PT) supervises the training progression of her/his patient weekly and if necessary assists the patient via remote or through a visit at home.

Vaccine Responses to SARS-CoV-2 and Other Emerging Infectious Diseases Background:  Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been highly effective against preventing severe disease. But the protective effects of these vaccines appear to wane over time. Researchers want to learn why.  Objective:  To learn more about how the immune system responds to vaccines against infections like SARS-CoV-2.  Eligibility:  Healthy adults ages 18 or older who are scheduled to receive either a new vaccine or a booster shot against SARS-COV-2 or another emerging infection.  Design:  Participants will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests.  Participants will have up to 8 study visits in 1 year. Each visit should last less than 2 hours. At each visit, participants will give blood samples. Some blood samples will be used for genetic testing. They will also give updates on their health.  After the first study visit, participants will receive either a first vaccination or a booster shot. They must get the vaccine in their community or workplace. They will not get the vaccine at NIH.  This study currently focuses on SARS-CoV-2, but it will expand to other infectious diseases as they emerge and become the target of new vaccines.  ...
The Efficacy of Acupuncture and Fu's Subcutaneous Needling (FSN ) in Treating Chronic Tension-type Headache by fMRI Epidemiological studies show a one-year prevalence of 30%-60% for episodic tension-type headache (TTH) and 2%-3% for chronic TTH (CTTH). Many TTH patients seek acupuncture treatment worldwide, and CTTH is one of the most commonly treated. FSN has been used to treat CTTH recently; the curative effect of it was especially good for CTTH accompanying pericranial tenderness. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of acupuncture and FSN for CTTH remains controversial. Several research results showed that symptoms of TTH improve after acupuncture treatment, but these improvements were more subjective than objective measures. So, the aim of this study is to determine the cerebral function efficacy of acupuncture and FSN in the treatment of CTTH, using Headache impact test questionnaire (HIT-6), VAS to evaluate the subjective symptom and fMRI to detect the objective cerebral function changes.  Intervention: device: acupuncture; Fu's subcutaneous; placebo sham acupuncture
Photobiomodulation in the Treatment of Hand-foot Syndrome A cytotoxic complication caused by chemotherapy is hand-foot syndrome, also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE). The mechanism is not yet clear, but it is thought that the chemotherapeutic agent generates cytotoxicity on the acral epidermis. Clinically it manifests as erythema and edema on the palms of the hands and feet, dry and scaly skin, accompanied by a sensation of tightness and pain. Extreme cases present blisters and ulcerations that may require hospitalization. It can also be accompanied by paresthesias. The main objective will be to evaluate if photobiomodulation is effective in reducing PPE induced by Capecitabine and 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy.  It will be a 4 week treatment, with 2 groups: G1 - Moisturizing cream and Photobiomodulation; G2: Moisturizing cream and photobiomodulation sham.
Correlating Probiotic Dietary Supplements During Pregnancy With Maternal Microbiome Profiles The overarching goal of this project is to compare the microbiome profiles of healthy pregnant women, both before and after the introduction of a probiotic supplement into the maternal diet. Specifically, the investigators are performing a pilot randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial, comparing the microbiome profiles of 40 healthy pregnant women randomized to receive an oral probiotic containing a mixture of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species (20 mothers) versus an oral placebo (20 mothers) during the first/second trimester of pregnancy. For each mother, the investigators will collect biospecimens from the vagina, rectum, and urine, both before intervention, and 4-6 weeks after intervention. These biospecimens will be analyzed to obtain their microbiome profiles using next-generation sequencing. The primary outcome of interest is the vaginal microbiome, with secondary outcomes including the microbiomes of the rectum and urine. Additionally, the investigators will collect clinical data from the mother's and infant's medical records to correlate our findings with pregnancy and postnatal outcomes.
PAV Trial During SBT Trial Weaning from mechanical ventilation is milestone in intensive care unit. The prolongation of mechanical ventilatory support is associated with contractility disorders of the diaphragm muscle as well as an increase in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia. On the other hand, an early interruption of mechanical ventilatory support could be associate with the onset of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, hemodynamic instability and the increased risk of re-intubation. Therefore, careful analysis of surrogate clinical parameters is essential in understanding "when" the critically ill patient is really ready for a complete weaning from mechanical ventilatory support. To date, the physician is invited to examine various clinical parameters predicting the success of extubation, such as hemodynamic stability, metabolic structure and the patient's state of consciousness. In addition, various surrogate ventilatory parameters help the clinician to understand the patient's degree of autonomy in the spontaneous breathing process, such as alveolar exchange, as well as the degree of ventilatory performance through the analysis of ventilatory parameters that can be evaluated during assisted mechanical ventilation. To date, the use of proportional assisted ventilation methods such as Proportional Assisted Ventilation + (PAV +) allow us to continuously evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system as well as the respiratory work that the patient sustains breath by breath.  The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the ventilatory parameters derived from the PAV ventilatory algorithm are also predictors of extubation success.

Cultured Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate and Other Cancers The purpose of this study is to evaluate the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) before and after treatment using an experimental method for detecting CTC, compared to commercial CTC assay results, in patients with prostate, breast or colorectal cancers.  Experiments will be done to develop a new assay technique and also test how CTC react to commonly used drugs. This information will be analyzed to determine if the experimental assays can be helpful in the future to predict how a patient's cancer may react to certain treatments.  The research experiments will also attempt to grow CTC for long-term or "immortal" cell lines that can be further studied for proteins and gene mutations related to the specific tumor (not familial), and testing for sensitivity to drugs.  Blood samples will be collected at specific time points during routine medical care from patients with prostate, breast, colorectal or other solid tumor cancer. Samples will also be collected from patients with no cancer for comparison purposes. Samples for the experimental tests will be identified only by codes and results will not be shared with participants. Patients with prostate, breast or colorectal cancer will also have blood samples drawn for commercial CTC assays as part of their standard care.

Optic Nerve Head Structural Response to IOP Elevation in Patients With Keratoconus The mechanism by which vision loss in glaucoma occurs is still unknown, but it is clear that increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor. It is also thought that the lamina cribrosa (LC) is a site of primary damage during the pathogenesis of the disease. The changes caused by intraocular pressure (IOP) modulation at the level of the optic nerve head and LC will be evaluated in the present study. Subjects with keratoconus exhibit abnormal collagen properties that can impair their LC behavior. By evaluating their lamina biomechanical response we can advance our understanding on the role of the lamina in glaucoma pathogenesis. A better understanding of the process will ultimately lead to improved detection and management of glaucoma.  It is hypothesized that subjects with keratoconus have an abnormal biomechanical response of the lamina cribrosa in response to IOP modulation.

Point-of-Care Echocardiography to Assess Impact of Dynamic Cardiac Function, Renal and Cardiac Biomarkers in Cirrhosis With Hepatorenal Syndrome-Acute Kidney Injury Point-of-care echocardiography (POC-Echo) is used to determine left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), inferior vena cava (IVC) dynamics and volume status in cirrhosis and Acute-on-chronic liver failure ACLF accurately.  We will assess IVC dynamics, LV systolic function \[LV ejection fraction (EF) \& cardiac output (CO)\], and diastolic dysfunction (E/e', e' and E/A ratio) and urinary biomarkers (cystatin C and NGAL) in patients with cirrhosis and ACLF with hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI).
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Pharmacokinetics of Antimicrobials in Children The purpose of this study is to learn more about antimicrobials, especially drug levels in the CSF that would normally be used in young children as part of standard care. These drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating infections. They are used extensively in children in the United States, but they have not been extensively studied in children or babies. The investigators do not have very much information on how children and babies handle these drugs; that is, how long it takes for the drugs to be removed from the blood circulation and to pass out of the body and how much goes into the central nervous system. The investigators also do not have good information to guide how often the investigators should give the drugs to children and babies to get the maximum effect on infections with the minimum amount of drug. Thus, the investigators will collect more information about how these drugs should be used in children and babies by doing this drug levels research study.

YOGA Asanas and Myofascial Chain Activity in Elderly Individuals Aging is a differentiation process with chronological, biological, psychological and social characteristics, which occurs in the intrauterine period and ends with death. With aging, the structures and functions of tissues are affected and there is a decline in overall physical performance. Asanas in yoga use tonic muscle contraction coordinated with breath control and kinesthetic awareness, which saves energy compared to phasic muscle contraction often observed in physical exercises. We have not encountered a study examining the effect of asanas on muscular activity in old age. Our study will provide support to the literature in this direction.
Intranasal Dexmedetomidine for Pain Management During Screening for Retinopathy of Prematurity Background: Preterm infants undergo serial eye examinations during their hospital stay to monitor for the development of a specific disease termed "retinopathy of prematurity". While those examinations are known to cause significant pain and stress, the current standard of care (sucrose and local anesthesia) is not adequate in terms of alleviation of pain.  Purpose: The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine for pain management in preterm infants undergoing routine eye examinations.  The main questions it aims to answer are:  * Does dexmedetomidine reduce the pain scores of preterm infants during and shortly after eye assessments in comparison to placebo (saline 0.9%). * Does dexmedetomidine cause more adverse effects than placebo.  In this crossover study participants will receive either dexmedetomidine or saline 0.9% intranasally 30 minutes before the examination, on top of the current standard of care. The participants will be monitored closely for 5 hours to note differences in adverse effects. The researchers will use video monitoring to assess the pain scores using a standardized and validated scoring system.

Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors: A Potential Novel Treatment for Epilepsy About 30% of persons with epilepsy have seizures that do not respond to drugs. The ketogenic diet is an effective treatment option for them, but this high fat diet is strict and difficult to maintain. The properties of gliflozins, which often are used to treat type 2 diabetes, make them a potential replacement for the ketogenic diet. This pilot study will determine whether gliflozins induce ketosis and could be used to treat adults with epilepsy safely.

Safety and the Pharmacokinetic Study of Characteristics of MKT-N2 (Montelukast) and Singulair® (Montelukast Sodium)to Treat Asthma The Purpose of A center, Randomized, Open label, single dose, Placebo-controlled, 2-Treatment, 2-Way, 2-Period Crossover Study to Compare the Safety and the Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of MKT-N2 (Montelukast) and Singulair® (montelukast sodium) tablet 10mg in Healthy Male Korean Subjects
Continuation of Anti-osteoporotic Treatment 1 Year After Initial Administration The aim of this observational study is to assess the obstacles and levers to the continuation of anti-osteoporotic treatment, and to identify those where action could be taken to improve the quality of care for fractured patients.  The individual and collective stakes are high. Fracture is the most feared complication of osteoporosis. The current under-diagnosis and under-treatment of this chronic pathology exposes patients to a high risk of early re-fracture, with the associated morbidity and mortality.  General practitioners have a major role to play in monitoring and coordinating patients' healthcare pathways. The aim of this study is to assess ways of improving osteoporosis management in order to improve quality of life and disability-free life expectancy for individual patients. The public health and economic stakes are equally high. It is by identifying the obstacles that prospective work on the key elements to be implemented could help optimize osteoporosis management.
Using Ripple Mapping to Guide Substrate Ablation of Scar Related Ventricular Tachycardia. The heart beat is controlled by electrical signals. Following a heart attack, part of the heart muscle dies and is later replaced by scar tissue. Within this area of scar, there often remain "channels" of surviving tissue still able to transmit electrical signals. However, it is well established that these "conduction channels" (CC) can form a short circuit around the scar, leading to electrical disturbances (arrhythmias) that are potentially life threatening. The commonest of these is ventricular tachycardia (VT), and is estimated to cause 300,000 deaths per year.  One recognised treatment option of VT involves burning (ablation) these "conduction channels" (CC) within the scar. However, at present, the procedure is long and is far off 100% effective. Consequently, current best practice does not rely on treating the VT, but rather preventing it from causing sudden death - this is achieved with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), a device which can recognise when a patient is in VT and deliver an internal shock to restore the normal electrical conduction. Patients with defibrillators subsequently are subject to recurrent painful and debilitating shocks which, although lifesaving, significantly reduce their quality of life. The limitation with ablation at present is due to the difficulty in visualising these CC's.  Investigators at Imperial College have created a novel electrogram visualisation program, Ripple Mapping (RM), which they have already found to be superior to currently used programmes in cases of arrhythmias in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). During a retrospective study in patients with scar related VT following a heart attack, when ablation was delivered in areas associated with identified Ripple Mapping Conduction Channels, these patients remained free of VT recurrence for \>2 year follow up interval.  The study hypothesis is that Ripple Mapping can identify all conduction channels within scar tissue critical to the VT circuit, ablation of which will lead to long-term freedom from VT and ICD therapies. The investigators now aim to perform a prospective randomised study comparing Ripple Mapping guided VT ablation against conventional VT ablation.
Use of Tranexamic Acid in the Total Knee Arthroplasty. Tranexamic acid is a medication used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery. Previous studies have shown tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss and post-operative blood transfusion rate without significant complications. In addition, many meta-analyses have confirmed these results. This study also aims to determine how safe and effective tranexamic acid treatment is for different patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty.
Assessment of N-Acetylcysteine as Therapy for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS) is an unexplained multisymptom/multisystem disorder for which there are currently no validated treatments. The present exploratory clinical trial aims to advance our understand of the mechanisms of in situ GSH synthesis control through assessment of the response of brain GSH and plasma markers of oxidative stress to different doses of NAC in comparison to placebo, as a potential treatment for ME/CFS that would provide neuroprotection against oxidative stress by restoring cortical GSH reserves. If successful, this exploratory clinical trial would address a significant public health concern by shedding new light onto the mechanisms of action of NAC in brain GSH restoration, which could open a new avenue for the development of potentially effective treatments for a disorder, ME/CFS, that currently has none.
Painless Myocardial Ischemia in Diabetic Patients. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the concentrations of blood orphanin, norepinephrine and the morbidity of painless myocardial ischemia in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Clinical Study of Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in the Treatment of Patients With Acute Cholecystitis Gallstone is a common disease in China.At present, the prevalence of gallstones in China is 15 %, and about 210 million people are sick. Acute cholecystitis is acute gallbladder inflammation, is one of the main complications of cholelithiasis or gallstones. The removal of gallbladder and gallstones in patients with acute cholecystitis in the presence of biliary pain will prevent the recurrence of gallbladder and reduce the risk of cholecystitis progression. If gallbladder perforation is not treated in time, the mortality rate is 30 %. Acute acalculous cholecystitis without treatment will be life-threatening, with a mortality rate of up to 50 %. At present, the vast majority of patients with acute cholecystitis are treated with 4-hole traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy and open cholecystectomy. Their postoperative quality of life, pain and scar-related complications, remain major factors for patients.In recent years, with the renewal of the concept of minimally invasive surgery and the continuous advancement of instruments and technology, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy has also maximized the quality of life after surgery and reduced postoperative pain and scar-related complications. At present, there are few reports on randomized controlled clinical trials of SILC in patients with acute cholecystitis, and there is a lack of large sample size studies.Due to the difficulty of SILC operation, the longer learning curve, the different equipment conditions and technical characteristics of each center, and the lack of standardized training, there is no effective consensus on the application indications and operation procedures of SILC in acute cholecystitis surgery. Based on the current status, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SILC on postoperative quality of life, postoperative pain, scar assessment and postoperative complications in patients with acute cholecystitis, so as to propose a standardized single incision laparoscopic operation procedure in the treatment of acute cholecystitis.

The investigators will conduct this prospective, randomized trial to determine the efficacy of pregabalin for neuropathic pain in cervical myelopathic patients in order to validate or refute this popular practice. The primary aim of this study was to compare Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs scale (LANSS) scores of neuropathic pain in cervical myelopathy patients.
Protection Against Pneumococcal Infection in Children With T1DM Children/ young people with diabetes may be at a higher risk of acquiring certain infections. These infections include those caused by a bacterium called the pneumococcus which can cause pneumonia, meningitis and ear infections. In the UK older children with diabetes are given a vaccine against the pneumococcus bug called Pneumovax (or PPS23 for short). Although PPS23 causes a good immune response in children over 2 years of age it is not actually known how well PPS23 protects against infection in children of any age. In addition there is some data in adults and children that PPS23 may result in a reduced response to future doses of pneumococcal vaccines (hyporesponsiveness). Because of the lack of information on how well PPS23 protects and potential hyporesponsiveness the investigators would like to study the use of an alternative vaccine against pneumococcus called Prevenar13 (or pCV13). This vaccine is known to be safe and to work well in babies and young children and there have been no concerns about hyporesponsiveness. It has been approved for use in children up to 17 years of age but there is little information on the size and duration of immune response to PCV13 in children aged 6 years and older.
To Test a Payer/Treatment Agency Intervention to Increase Use of Buprenorphine A team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering and Oregon Health \& Science University will test whether clinician training and the use of organizational change strategies are sufficient for disseminating an evidence-based practice (EBP), or if changes to both organizational systems and payer policy results in greater EBP use. Demonstrating the role of payment policy as a driver in the adoption of evidence-based practices could provide a contribution to dissemination and implementation science. This study will employ an intervention that was developed through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded Advancing Recovery (AR) program. In AR, payer/treatment organization partnerships in 12 states collaborated to remove systemic barriers to the adoption of EBPs such as medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse disorders. The resulting "AR Framework" of payer and organizational change strategies will be tested against its ability to increase the use of the addiction medication buprenorphine as compared to organizational change strategies alone. Buprenorphine is an EBP for treating people addicted to heroin or opioid-based pain medications for non-medical use. Buprenorphine has experienced low adoption rates and is not a standard part of addiction treatment. In Ohio, the location of the study, deaths to due to accidental overdoses of opioids has increased by 304% over the past decade and surpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of accidental deaths in 2006. Ohio was selected for the study because of the public health significance of opioid abuse and because each county in Ohio acts as a stand-alone payer, offering 48 unique eligible payer environments. This trial will develop a deeper understanding of the role payers and treatment organizations play in implementing and disseminating EBPs and will focus on the public health issue of rising opioid abuse.
Efficacy of PMZ-2010 (Centhaquine) a Resuscitative Agent for Hypovolemic Shock This is a prospective, multi-centric, randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled phase-III efficacy clinical study of PMZ-2010 therapy in patients with hypovolemic shock.  Centhaquine (previously used names, centhaquin and PMZ-2010; International Non-proprietary Name (INN) recently approved by WHO is centhaquine) has been found to be an effective resuscitative agent in rat, rabbit and swine models of hemorrhagic shock, it decreased blood lactate, increased mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and decreased mortality. An increase in cardiac output during resuscitation is mainly attributed to an increase in stroke volume. Centhaquine acts on the venous α2B-adrenergic receptors and enhances venous return to the heart, in addition, it produces arterial dilatation by acting on central α2A-adrenergic receptors to reduce sympathetic activity and systemic vascular resistance.

To Evaluate the Health Effect of Particular Fatty Acids Profiles From Eggs In a previous study, 24 volunteers consumed two conventional eggs or two eggs naturally enriched with omega 3, 5 and 7 every day for 3 months. It was shown that these eggs were well tolerated and that the omega enrichment led to a reduction in waist circumference of 3 cm in 3 months.  The objective of Omegasnack study was therefore to go further in the evaluation of these effects on waist circumference; 1) confirm the effects of these eggs on waist circumference when included in a snack, 2) determine whether this reduction in waist circumference is linked to a reduction in muscle and/or fat mass (subcutaneous and/or visceral) and 3) evaluate whether these effects are associated with a modification in the accumulation of ectopic fat in the muscle and/or liver.

Pharmacokinetics of Calcineurin & mTOR Inhibitors in HIV-1 Infected Kidney Transplant Recipients After Switch to BIC/FTC/TAF Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a critical comorbidity for patients living with HIV (PLWH), with an estimated prevalence between 2.4 and 17%, leading to end-stage renal disease 3 to 6 fold more than non-HIV population. However kidney transplantation for PLWH has become the first-line therapy for end-stage renal disease, with an enhanced survival benefit compared to remaining on dialysis.  Management of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients (HIV-KTR) has historically been problematic because of the potential nephrotoxicity of some antiretroviral drugs and the interactions between calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and ritonavir or cobicistat-boosted containing-ART. The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a widely recommended nucleotide analogue for the treatment of both HIV and HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection, is restricted in vulnerable kidney population as HIV-KTR due to its major potential toxicity consistent with tubular dysfunction and rarely with a progressive sustained decline in renal function. The optimal long-term ART regimen is not known in HIV-KTR, though it makes intuitive sense to avoid regimens containing TDF, given its potential nephrotoxicity. Nevertheless the potent virological efficacy of TDF both on HIV and HBV and its highest in-vitro barrier to resistance among the Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors makes tenofovir use highly recommended or even essential in HIV/HBV co-infections.  Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and bictegravir (BIC) are 2 novel antiretroviral drug available in HIV treatment in combination with emtricitabine (F) (B/F/TAF):  \* TAF is a novel prodrug of tenofovir that may offer improved renal safety over TDF. TAF is more stable in plasma and is metabolized intracellularly by cathepsin A, an enzyme that is highly expressed in lymphoid tissues. Therefore, TAF can achieve higher intracellular levels of the active moiety tenofovir diphosphate, with lower levels of circulating tenofovir when compared with TDF. This more targeted treatment could potentially result in fewer renal and bone complications despite the same clinical efficacy as TDF. TAF was approved for use in PLWH with mild-moderate CKD (eGFR: 30-69 mL/min).  The availability of TAF seems a potential addition to the antiretroviral armamentarium in HIV-KTR. \* BIC is a novel second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) has a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and in-vitro activity against most INSTI-resistant variants and has low potential for clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions. BIC has been recently approved by the FDA, in coformulated B/F/TAF for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral naïve subjects and in those with suppressed viremia.  No data are available yet with TAF use in HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients as well as with BIC, especially about potential drug-to-drug interactions with immunosuppressive drugs such as calcineurin \& mTOR inhibitors.  At last simplification to a single tablet regimen (STR) may offer a once-daily option for HIV-KTR who have multiple comorbidities, often requires complex regimens with a high pill burden.
Predicting the Clinical Response to Omalizumab With Anti-Immunoglobulin E (IgE) Ab Response or Syk Expression in Basophils This research is being done to test whether differences in blood cells at baseline (start of the study) can be used to predict how well omalizumab will work in a patient. Omalizumab (Xolair) is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat asthma. Studies show that omalizumab improves the symptoms of asthma but some people experience better improvement than others.
Opportunistic Salpingectomy at the Time of Benign Laparoscopic Hysterectomy In this prospective study, patients who underwent benign laparoscopic hysterectomy with systematic salpingectomy were included. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of tubal histopathological abnormalities such as Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC) and tumor protein 53 (p53) signatures) as well as the prevalence of perioperative and postoperative complications related to opportunistic laparoscopic salpingectomy in a low risk population. The hypothesis is that prophylactic salpingectomy during benign laparoscopic hysterectomy is both feasible and innocuous. Peri- and postoperative complications, duration of salpingectomy and post-salpingectomy blood loss, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis with anti-p53 antibody were evaluated.
The Effect of COVID-19 on Diabetes Mellitus The study aimed to evaluate the effect of SARS-COV-2 infection on metabolic status in patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients' HbA1c levels before and after SARS-COV-2 infection will be evaluated.
Antenatal Betamethasone and the Risk of Neonatal Hypoglycemia A single "supraphysiological" course of exogenous corticosteroids is recommended between 24-34 weeks' gestation to minimize the adverse sequelae associated with prematurity. The 24-hour profile of endogenous corticosteroids normally follows a diurnal rhythm with the highest serum level occurs between 5am-11am and nadir over 12 hours.
Rhythmic Handwriting Deficits and General Rhythmic Abilities in Children Patients with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects motor skills and motor learning (APA, 2013), have been reported to manifest rhythmic deficits in handwriting domain, as well as general rhythmic deficits (i.e., regardless handwriting context per se) (Rosenblum \& Regev, 2013). Accordingly, children with DCD struggle in tasks like synchronising to an external musical rhythm (in rhythm production tasks) or even in discrimination tasks such as detecting beat deviations, i.e., in rhythm perception tasks (INSERM collective expertise, 2019).  These rhythmic deficits which manifest in a variety of tasks and conditions support the hypothesis of a "generalised dysrhythmia" in DCD, according to which the rhythmic deficits - in perceptual tasks and motor production - could have a common source, namely a mechanism devoted to rhythm processing (a cerebral mechanism involved in the perception of rhythm) and independent of the effectors involved and the type of task considered.  However, the nature of the relationships between general rhythmic skills (perceptual and motor) and rhythmic abilities when engaged in handwriting movement is largely unknown in DCD. Whether a common source drives these diverse rhythmic deficits remains to explore. If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, this would pave the way for innovative therapeutic tools (e.g., serious games) for training a central rhythmic processing mechanism (rhythm perception), which could positively impact in turn rhythmicity of thandwriting movement in this population.
NT-proBNP and New Biomarkers in Patients With Dyspnea and/or Peripheral Edema The objectives of this study are to:  * Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of NT-proBNP (N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide) and new biomarker measurements for the diagnosis of heart failure in patients with acute dyspnea and/or edema. * Determine the exact biomarker cut-off point(s) for the differentiation of healthy persons, patients with heart failure and patients with dyspnea of other origin. * Evaluate treatment costs in patients with dyspnea under special consideration of NT-proBNP measurement.

Artificial Intelligence in the Detection of Right Sided Colonic Polyp in Different Operator Experience Colonoscopy is the gold standard modality for the detection of colonic polyp. However, miss polyp occurs especially in right sided colon. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the modality to improve polyp detection but the benefit of AI in operators with different endoscopic experience is still limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of AI in the detection of right sided colonic polyp in operators with different endoscopic experience by using double insertion of right side colon, back-to-back basis.
The Effects of Insulin Detemir and Gliclazide-MR Treatments on Endothelial Functions in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes The main purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the addition of sulfonylurea (gliclazide MR) or ,alternatively, basal insulin (insulin detemir) to life-style modification and metformin treatment as a second step treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus on endothelial cell functions. The second goal is to identify the effects of these treatment alternatives on body-mass index, the changes in body fat mass, insulin resistance and on the insulin secretion capacity of beta cells. The third aim of this study is to determine the success rates of these treatment alternatives on glycemic control at 6 months follow-up.

71A/G HSD17B5 SNP and Effects of Oral Contraceptive Pill in PCOS Women An association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter gene that codify for 17b-HSD5 enzyme (71A\>G) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hyperandrogenemia has been suggested in previous studies.  Given the role of 17b-HSD5 in androgenic metabolism producing testosterone from precursors, the investigators hypothesis is that women with PCOS and with the variant allele G have a poor response on hirsutism and on hormonal and metabolic variables after oral contraceptive pill (OCP) treatment for 6 months.
Impact of Anti-cytomegalovirus Treatment in the Management of Relapsing Ulcerative Colitis Requiring Vedolizumab Therapy Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that can require the use of anti-TNF alpha therapy. When anti-TNF alpha failed to obtain a clinical response, the use of a new anti-integrin therapy, vedolizumab, can be proposed. The efficacy of vedolizumab has been assessed in a phase 3 study (GEMINI I), with response rates of 41.1% with vedolizumab vs 25.5% with placebo.  CytoMegaloVirus (CMV) reactivation has been associated with resistance to steroid and to several lines of immunosuppressive therapy. Antiviral therapy was proven to decrease the tissue viral load and to restore the response to immunosuppressive therapies (up to 80% in small group of patients). A recent meta-analysis supports the use of valganciclovir in case of CytoMegaloVirus (CMV) reactivation in active Ulcerative Colitis (UC).  Moreover, a study showed that the risk of CMV reactivation seems to be more important with vedolizumab than with anti TNF, and the risk of colectomy is higher in case of CytoMegaloVirus (CMV) reactivation (p\<0.05).
MEK Inhibitor AZD6244 in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma This phase II trial is studying how well MEK inhibitor AZD6244 works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma. MEK inhibitor AZD6244 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Burden of Nintedanib Non-adherence Among Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Patients This study has two objectives:  1. To assess the association between nintedanib adherence trajectory group (as measured from a Group-based Trajectory Modelling (GBTM)) and health care resource use, with a focus on inpatient hospitalization, among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). 2. To assess the association between a patient's nintedanib adherence trajectory group (as measured from a GBTM) and their medical costs among patients with IPF.
Neuroimaging of the Effects of Concerta in the Treatment of ADHD A number of brain regions have been down to be altered in both structure and function in patients with ADHD, including prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, caudate and cerebellum. Patients with ADHD often show reduced levels of activity in the frontal and cingulate regions of brain while performing measures of inhibitory control during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While stimulant medications robustly improve the clinical symptoms of ADHD, there are only a small number of studies examining the effects of these commonly prescribed medications on brain activity. We propose to obtain fMRI in patients with ADHD on placebo and on their individualized dose of OROS methylphenidate (Concerta). Our hypothesis is that Concerta will increase the activity of the brain in the frontal, cingulate and amygdala of the brain and that these brain changes will be associated with clinical improvement of symptoms.
Testing the Safety of CB-5339 in Patients With Cancer This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CB-5339 in treating patients with solid tumors that has spread to other places in the body (advanced) or lymphomas. CB-5339 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Effectiveness of Mobile Phone Technology on Adherence and Treatment Outcomes Among HIV Positive Patients on ART The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of mobile phone technology (SMS and telephone call reminders) in improving adherence and treatment outcomes among HIV positive patients on ART in Malaysia.
Arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) for the Management of Type-2 Diabetes The project aims to achieve significantly improved clinical care for type 2 diabetes. The current standard treatment metformin has low adherence due to its main side effect gut dysbiosis, which also results in more complications and high overall costs. Prebiotics have been suggested as a medical food and might be helpful as adjuvant management in type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Carbiotix AB has developed, a corn fiber extract containing arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS), which have great potential for improving gut health. In this project, it will be investigated whether the intake of a hybrid product containing AXOS together with metformin can significantly improve glucose metabolism and gut health in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Efficacy and Safety of AS012 in Subjects With Non-segmental Vitiligo This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study. The study will be performed as a multicenter, multinational study.
Bioenergetic Alterations After Exenatide Administration The purpose of this study is to find out how exenatide causes weight loss. Specifically, the study is assessing how exenatide may change how people take in energy (energy intake), as well as how it may effect how people use energy (energy expenditure).
Nasal High Flow Therapy for the Treatment of Respiratory Insufficiencies During Sleep Respiratory insufficiencies during sleep can lead to reductions in the level of oxygen in the blood during the night, which has been shown to contribute to a range of morbidities.  The purpose of this study is to assess the possibility that a nasal high flow therapy device may be able to treat respiratory insufficiencies, by stabilizing breathing and preventing reduction in blood oxygen.  Heart failure patients will be screened at a heart failure clinic, and will be asked to undergo an overnight sleep study to determine is they exhibit respiratory insufficiencies during sleep. This sleep study may be completed in the sleep laboratory (attended polysomnography, PSG) or in-home (in-home polygraphy, PG). If they are diagnosed with respiratory insufficiencies, they will be asked to attend further overnight studies to see if treatment with nasal high flow therapy can be used to stabilize breathing.
Identification of Risk Factors Causing Difficulty in Laryngeal Mask Insertion Even if the laryngeal mask (LM) is considered a very safe device with a low incidence of complications there may be situations where it is difficult to insert.  Therefore it seems appropriate to carry out a prospective observational study that will identify the risk factors relating to the positioning of LM for the purpose of identification and prediction of them.  From reading the literature and from the opinion of the experts with extensive practice in airway management (part of the Working Group "Management of Airway" of the Italian Society of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care) some possible causes of difficulty in the insertion of laryngeal mask have been identified; these possible causes were listed in a report that will be distributed to the centers enrolled in the conduction of the study.  1,864 patients will be enrolled in 8 Italian research centers to calculate the relative risk of each of the factors analyzed in order to identify those that, in view of the LM positioning, must be modified to reduce the risk of failure and, secondly, to identify the risk factors whose presence may contraindicate the use of the device and indicate the use of alternative methods for airway management.
LHA510 Proof-of-Concept Study as a Maintenance Therapy for Patients With Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 84 successive days of topically administered LHA510 compared to vehicle in reducing the number of patients requiring intravitreal (IVT) anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (Lucentis®) for recurrence of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
Database for Data Collection in the Context of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Program in Oncology Surgery Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Programs (ERP) includes multimodal approaches of perioperative patient's clinical pathways designed to achieve early recovery after surgery and a decreased length of hospital stay (LOS).
Dociparstat Sodium (CX-01) Combined With Standard Induction Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia This was an exploratory Phase 2, open label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group study to determine whether there was evidence that the addition of dociparstat (CX-01) at 2 different does levels to standard induction therapy (cytarabine+idarubicin, "7+3") and consolidation therapy had an additive therapeutic effect for subjects newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) when compared with subjects receiving standard induction chemotherapy alone.
Low Dose Ketamine and Acute Pain Crisis BACKGROUND:  Current treatment standard for acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is largely supportive care: opioid analgesics, hydration, oxygen, and blood transfusion. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic condition associated with serious and disabling acute consequences such as a vaso-occlusive (VOC) or pain crisis. Uncontrolled pain is the hallmark of a VOC, and often results in acute unscheduled care in the patient's clinic or hospital emergency department (ED). During these pain crises, patients sometimes require high doses of opioids for analgesia. Opioid analgesics are fraught with challenges including the development of tolerance, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (whereby the use of opioids actually makes patients more sensitive to pain). Finding non-opioid alternatives for intravenous analgesia is problematic based on the limited availability this class of drugs. Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that even at low doses has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunct to opioids for acute pain control.  OBJECTIVE:  The investigators will determine the comparative efficacy of low doses of ketamine as an adjunct to opioids versus standard care (opioids alone) for the treatment of acute severe pain in patients with sickle cell related pain crisis.  METHODS:  The investigators propose a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to determine the efficacy of ketamine 0.3mg/kg vs. placebo for the treatment of acute pain crisis. The investigators will include all eligible emergency department ≥18 years. The investigators will stratify 42 patients by location, 21 patients per site. Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) will be recorded as a part of the study log at 0, 1, 2 and 3hrs after the study drug administration.  HYPOTHESIS:  The investigators hypothesize that the ketamine will decrease overall pain intensity, visit length of stay, and hospitalizations.

A Phase I Trial of High-Dose Ascorbate in Glioblastoma Multiforme This is a phase 1 (first in man) study testing the safety of adding high dose ascorbate (vitamin C) to standard radiation and chemotherapy for initial treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
Study Comparing Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion Of ABBV-951 With Oral Carbidopa/Levodopa Tablets For Treatment Of Motor Fluctuations In Adult Participants With Advanced Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition, which affects the brain. PD gets worse over time, but how quickly it progresses varies a lot from person to person. Some symptoms of PD are tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. This study measures the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ABBV-951 versus oral Levodopa (LD)/Carbidopa (CD) \[LD/CD\] in advanced PD participants to achieve reduction in motor fluctuations.  ABBV-951 is an investigational (unapproved) drug containing Levodopa Phosphate/Carbidopa Phosphate (LDP/CDP) given subcutaneously (under the skin) for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Adult participants with advanced PD will be enrolled. Approximately 130 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites across the world.  In one arm, participants will receive ABBV-951 solution as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral placebo capsules for LD/CD. In the second arm, participants will receive placebo solution for ABBV-951 as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral capsules containing LD/CD tablets. The treatment duration is 12 weeks.  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.
Prognosis and Survival Estimates in Palliative Therapy The accuracy of clinical survival estimates is tested in comparison to objective prognostic scores.
A Phase II Trial of Trisenox Plus Thalomid as Treatment in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk MDS (defined by IPSS).  Each cycle of treatment will be 6 weeks in length. Patients will be evaluated every 6 weeks for response. Patients will be treated for a minimum of 12 weeks even in the absence of response. Following 12 weeks of treatment, patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The Role of Preoperative Immunonutrition on Morbidity and Immune Response After Cystectomy (INCyst Trial) The goal of this clinical trial research study is to evaluate the impact of preoperative oral immunonutrition (IN) on post-operative complications in patients undergoing a cystectomy.  As a secondary focus, this study will aim to develop a signature that would identify patients that would benefit the most from IN.  This is a multicentric (Swiss: N=3), prospective, controlled, pragmatic, parallel-group comparative study with block randomization stratified by centers.
Family Activation and Communication About Errors and Safety (FACES) Miscommunications are a leading cause of serious medical errors in hospitals, contributing to more than 60% of sentinel events, the most serious adverse events reported to the Joint Commission. Efforts to improve patient safety in hospitals have centered on improving communication between providers. While provider-focused communication interventions have led to reductions in patient harm, patients and families have been notably absent from most interventions to improve patient safety. This proposal seeks to develop a family safety reporting intervention.
Periodontal Care and Glycemic Control in Diabetes Diabetes is a prevalent and costly disease among users of VA care. Goals of diabetes care include the prevention and/or delay of complications via adequate glycemic control. Improvements in periodontal status may also improve diabetes control.
Epidemiological Study About the Evolution of Patients Treated for an Acute Episode of Vulvovaginal Candidiasis To determine proportion of women achieving clinical and mycological cure or have recurrences / reinfection after being treated for an acute episode of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
Immunogenicity of Inactivated and Live Polio Vaccines This study is an open-label phase III randomized clinical trial that would compare immunogenicity after receiving one of five different combinations of polio vaccines. Infants will be enrolled and randomized at 6 weeks of age to one of five different arms:  A) Three doses of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age B) Three doses of bivalent OPV (bOPV) at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age C) Two doses of intramuscular (IM) inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) at 6 and 14 weeks of age D) Two doses of intra-dermal (ID) fractional IPV (f-IPV) at 6 and 14 weeks of age E) Sequential administration of ID f-IPV at 6 and 14 weeks of age with bOPV at 10 weeks of age To assess the immunogenicity of each study vaccine and vaccination schedule, antibody titers against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 will be determined in sera extracted from blood collected before (at 6 weeks of age) and after receiving 3 doses of study vaccine (18 weeks of age). Seroconversion will be defined as a titer 4-fold higher than the expected fall in maternally derived antibodies, assuming a half-life of 28 days. The initial antibody titer at 6 weeks of age will be used as the starting point for the expected decline in maternal antibody.  This study will compare the immunogenicity of:  1. Sequential dose of intra-dermal f-IPV and bOPV to bOPV alone administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age 2. tOPV to bOPV administered at 6,10 and 14 weeks of age 3. IM IPV to ID f-IPV administered at 6 and 14 weeks of age The answer to these questions will guide the global polio eradication program in designing new routine immunization schedule for children that eliminates the risks of paralysis due to vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) from type 2 vaccine poliovirus.
(-)- Epicatechin Becker Muscular Dystrophy This is a 48-week open-label extension of our initial proof-of-concept study (UCD0113) in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy who participated in the earlier trial. This single center study will enroll up to 10 adults who will receive the purified nutritional extract (-)-epicatechin 100mg/day orally for 8 weeks. After screening visits, participants will be enrolled in the study if they meet all inclusion criteria. They will be evaluated at screening, baseline, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 16 and 48. The main criterion for success of the study will be presence of one or more biologic or strength and performance outcome measures that yield a response magnitude that allows for sufficient power in a Phase II B study with a sample size of 30 individuals.
Gut Microbiota in the Progression of Alpha-synucleinopathies The aim of this study is to correlate baseline gut microbiota features and the progression of neurodegeneration in the established cohort of patients with early Parkinson's disease.
Intraocular Pressure Immediately Following Intravitreous Injection of Ranibizumab This study will quantify the intraocular pressure elevation in the immediate time period following intravitreous injection. With more widespread use of intravitreous injections in patients that may require several injections per year, it is important to document the sudden increase in intraocular pressure, including the maximum intraocular pressure and the time required for the intraocular pressure to return to baseline. This data may be useful in stimulating additional studies to evaluate the long term ocular effects of repeated intravitreous injections.  We hypothesize that the intraocular pressure increases significantly following intravitreous injection and then returns to baseline during the initial thirty minutes following ranibizumab injection.
Waitlist-Control Trial of Smartphone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The investigators hypothesize that participants receiving app-CBT will have greater improvement in body dysmorphic disorder symptom severity than those in the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 12).
Evaluation and Treatment of Substance Abuse in Veterans With PTSD Disability Claims Veterans can apply for compensation and pension (C \& P) benefits for a disability related to military service. The application exam for these benefits provides an opportunity for Veterans returning from service to access VA care. The investigators will recruit Veterans applying for C \& P to participate in this study. All enrolled participants will complete questionnaires around the time of their C \& P exam related to substance abuse, PTSD, service use, and attitudes. The investigators will monitor enrolled Veterans' attendance at treatment over time, and examine whether C \& P award, substance use, and beliefs about benefits are related to treatment attendance. Some enrolled participants will be assigned to one of two study groups: a treatment group and a no-additional-treatment group. People assigned to these groups will complete the same substance abuse, PTSD, service use, and attitudes questionnaires two additional times during the study. Participants assigned to the treatment group will receive information about the relationship between substance use and PTSD and will be referred to relevant treatment. The investigators will test whether Veterans who receive no-additional-treatment have different symptoms over time and attend less treatment sessions (mental health or substance abuse) than people assigned to treatment.
Intravenous Immunoglobulins as Effective Treatment in Sydenham's Chorea Children are at risk of developing an involuntary movement disorder after streptococcal throat infections. Not all children are affected and the severity is individually variable. Affected children have alteration in their behaviour and mood and can become quite compromised in their activities of daily living. The condition is believed to be related to the body having an over efficient immune response to the infection and some of the antibodies made in response to the infection also "attack" centres in the brain controlling movement and mood. Treating these children with immunoglobulins, which "mop up" the antibodies may reverse or improve affected children. This study hopes to clarify this.
Contribution of L-Tyrosine to Recovery From Operational Strain on Return From External Operation Operational conditions amplify soldier's constraints and stress factors, upsetting individual and collective adaptive landmarks. The soldier's resistance is strained by the high intensity of stressors, by the long duration of exposure and by their cumulative effect.  This may lead to a state of "operational strain" that refers to chronic stress and the allostatic load imposed by operational constraint.  The investigators believe that operational strain could manifest itself by a kind of accelerated aging of the organism due to the increased allostatic load without sufficient resource restoration (neurotransmitter precursors, partial and repeated sleep deprivation, etc.).  This aging mechanism would be reversible after a sufficient period of resource restoration (sleep, physical activity, adapted diet, etc.).
Gadoxetic Acid-enhanced MR Evaluation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Dysplastic Nodules in the Cirrhotic Liver A prospective intra-individual study to investigate the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR for the patients with liver cirrhosis using thin-section whole-explant as standard of reference
Families on Track: A Digital Health Behavioral Intervention for Parents Seeking Treatment for Their Child With Obesity Current models of outpatient childhood obesity treatment focus on the child's health habits, with limited efficacy. In part, this may be because childhood obesity is highly sensitive to parental lifestyle habits, who are often not a direct target of child obesity interventions. This study aims to target weight loss among overweight parents of 2-16 year old children with obesity enrolled in the Duke Healthy Lifestyles Program (HL) in order to augment child body mass index reduction. The intervention, " Families on Track" is a digital health intervention platform using the Interactive Obesity Treatment Approach (iOTA).

Contraceptive Hormone and Reward Measurement (CHARM Study) Purpose of this study: The purpose of this study is to learn more about how hormonal oral contraceptives affect brain processes and emotional wellbeing.  Procedures: If participants agree to participate, the following will happen:  1. Eligibility visit (remote screening session) 2. If participants are eligible to participate in the study, they will be placed in one of two groups. If they are in the first group, they will be asked to take an oral contraception pill ("study drug") every day for 21 days. If they are in the second, they will take a placebo every day for 21 days. A placebo is a pill that looks like medicine but is not real and will have no medical effect on participants. Participants will not get to choose which group they are in, nor will they be told which group they are in. 3. During the three-week period in which participants will take either the study drug or placebo, they will be asked to complete daily check-in surveys on their computer or mobile device. 4. Participants will be asked to attend two additional visits over the course of about three weeks. At these visits, participants will be asked to undergo a urine drug screen, a blood draw, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They will also be asked to complete behavioral questionnaires.
Pimavanserin and Aggression and Social Cognition. The investigators are studying how certain drugs can reduce anger outbursts in people with anger problems. In this study the investigators seek to determine if a single 34 mg (two 17 mg tablets) oral dose of the 5-HT2a receptor blocker, pimavanserin, will reduce aggressive responding in individuals with impulsive aggression (Intermittent Explosive Disorder: IED) on a laboratory task that assesses aggression (Taylor Aggression Paradigm: TAP). We will also be examining how this drug impacts hostile social cognition e.g., hostile attribution). If pimvanserin reduces aggression in this study a next step would be a placebo-controlled treatment trial of pimavanserin in study participants with IED. Participation will first involve a remote (e.g., TEAMS) screening session. If potential study participants appear eligible they will come into the lab for an in-person session where participants will complete interviews and questionnaires and have a medical evaluation (including a physical exam, electrocardiogram, and screens for alcohol and drug use). During the next study session, participants will complete a diagnostic interview and a series of questionnaires, all of which can all take place on-line. During the next two sessions (which will be in-person) participants will undergo two (2) study sessions during which study participants will be given a study drug (orally). The drug given, pimavanserin, is currently available and is known to block serotonin receptors thought to be involved in regulating anger. After participants take the study drug, study participants will complete questionnaires and computer tasks for assessment of aggression and of hostile social cognition. Each of these two in-person study sessions will take at least eight (8) hours. A final on-line session will be done to make certain the investigators have all the data required by the study protocol.

A Phase I/II Study of Carboplatin and Etoposide With or Without Obatoclax in Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) The Phase I portion of this protocol will determine the best phase II dose and schedule of obatoclax with carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. The Phase II portion will evaluate the response rate to this regimen.
Medical Decision Making in Multiple System Atrophy The goal of this clinical study is to evaluate the effects of a personalized symptomatic treatment plan integrated with monthly telemedicine and mobile palliative care interventions on a population of individuals diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and their informal caregivers. The aim is to improve the quality of life of MSA patients and their caregivers, as well as provide them with better support during the disease progression.  After a baseline visit, all 46 patients will receive a personalized therapeutic plan (including medical treatment, physiotherapy, logotherapy and occupational therapy excercises and psychological support) and contact with social workers and a palliative care team. They willl then be re-evaluated at 6-,12-, 18- month visits. Semi-structured online interviews at baseline and 12 month visit will collect patients' individual healthcare preferences, which will be taken into account in the preparation of the individual therapeutic plan. Twenty-three patients will be randomized to receive monthly telemedicine visits. Assessment of patients´satisfaction with the therapeutic plan, with the palliative interventions (when they occurred) and the telemedicine visits will be carried over the 18 month period.  Forty-six informal caregivers will be invited to participate with semi-structured online interviews and assessment of their QoL and caregivers' burden.
A Pilot Project to Assess the Impact of Diabetes Education During Ophthalmology Visits The overarching purpose of this project is to provide diabetes education to the diverse patient population at the Lions Eye Clinic, a resident-run ophthalmology practice at California Pacific Medical Center. Because of high clinic volume in a teaching environment, our patients often experience long wait times. The goal of this program is to utilize this wait time for diabetes education, a much-needed corollary to the eye care that patients receive at our clinic.  This pilot project will investigate the impact of a program like this in our patient population. Specifically, the investigators are investigating whether diabetes education delivered in an ophthalmology setting enhances patient understanding of diabetes (via knowledge surveys) and/or leads to improved blood glucose control (via hemoglobin A1c). This is a 6-month study that runs through April 2015, and looks at the impact of an interactive diabetes education iPad app +/- in-person sessions with a diabetes educator. A subset of patients who meet with a diabetes educator will also be shown their own retinal images (compared to a normal retina).
TRAnexamic Acid for Preventing Blood Loss Following a Cesarean Delivery in Women With Placenta pREVIA Several randomized, controlled trials, mostly involving women undergoing cesarean delivery, have shown that the prophylactic intravenous administration of 1 g of tranexamic acid after childbirth reduced blood loss. Most were small, single-centre trials with considerable methodologic limitations.  It is important to emphasize that none of these RCTs has included women at increased risk of PPH such as placenta previa, a context in which the prevalence of moderate and severe blood loss is significantly higher and where the magnitude of the effect of TXA may highly differ compared to low risk women
Tazemetostat in Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors This phase 2, open label, single arm study will investigate the use of tazemetostat in patients with recurrent/refractory and/or metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
Systematically Assessing Effects of Colored Light on Humans With a Multi-modal Approach (Substudy 7 of 7) NOTE: This is the seventh of in total 7 sub-studies related to the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Bern Ref. No. KEK-BE 2016-00674. This sub-study includes 50 participants and 8 arms, in total 350 participants will be assessed in all 7 sub-studies.  General study information: This is a randomized, cross-over, quantitative study, which investigates physiological variables, mood, and affect of healthy participants in response to colored light exposure. The Participants take part in 5-8 arms and are exposed to colored light only, or are additionally asked to solve cognitive tasks during the colored light exposure. Primary aim is to measure the change in several physiological variables, mood, and affect during colored light exposure of 15 or 45 minutes. The risk for the participants is negligible and comparable to the risk during daily life.
SB-681323-Methotrexate Interaction Study SB-681323 is a p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor that has potential uses in inflammatory conditions such as RA. Previous p38 MAP-kinase inhibitors have been hindered in development by liver toxicity. Methotrexate (common treatment for RA patients) also has potential liver toxicity. This study was an enabling study to determine the safety of co-administration of the two compounds with respect to liver function
Study of Bio-K+® in the Reduction of the Risk of Clostridium Difficile Infection and Antibiotic Associated Diarrhea Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and particularly Clostridium difficile-Infection (CDI) are the most common causes of healthcare associated infectious diarrhea. In light of the results obtained in a limited number of randomized clinical trials in subjects with AAD and CDI in comparison with the widespread occurrence of these diseases, it is felt that the addition of a well-controlled clinical trial in a western environment would add value to support the use of a specific probiotic to counteract these diseases.
Traditional Physiotherapy Protocol vs Prescribed Exercises in Impingement Syndrome of the Shoulder Pain and limitation of shoulder mobility resulting from sub-shoulder syndrome called sub acromion impingement syndrome (SIS) are a big social problem in highly developed countries. This work aims to compare the method of treating SIS ailments taking into account the monitored exercises on their own- hands off, to the traditional method of individual physiotherapy considering manual therapy, TENS and local cryotherapy- hands on. The study will qualify people aged 18-50 years without previous injections, surgical procedures and physiotherapy within the shoulder joint. The initial examination of the participants will include: ultrasound examination, Neer test, functional mobility test according to FMS, clinical examination: palpation of the joint area, cross body adduction test, radial artery pulse test, numerical pain scale 0-10, DASH questionnaire. After the initial checkups, 60 people will be qualified for the proper examination. Selected participants will be divided into two groups of 30 people, each group consisting of 15 women and 15 men. The first group will undergo self-therapy for 3-5 months. The subjects will exercise independently for about 1.5 hours a day, three times a week. Every two weeks, each subject will be admitted to a follow-up visit, during which the physiotherapist will recommend another set of exercises and check the progress. The second group will undergo traditional physiotherapy three times a week for a period of three months. After a period of 3-5 months, both groups will undergo the same examination as initially. The results of both studies will be compared in both groups. The groups will then be compared to each other.
Effect of Parenteral Glutamine on Myocardial Injury and Inflammation Biomarkers The effect of parenteral glutamine on the biomarkers of myocardial injury and inflammation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with and without cardiopulmonary bypass (DCP) will be analyzed. Randomized controlled clinical trial, from October 2018 to February 2022. 124 patients: 14 patients with DCP and 14 patients without DCP, both + glutamine (L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, at a dose of 0.4 g / kg) 6 hours before surgery and 14 patients with PCD and 14 patients without PCD + placebo (saline) 6 hours before surgery. Blood samples will be taken to measure the level of TROP-I, CPK-MB, HSP-70, TNFa, IL6, IL10 and PCR 1 hour before the administration of Glutamine / Placebo, 1 hour before surgery, then at 1 , 12 and 24 hours after surgery.
MR Assessment of Hepatic Hydatid Disease Hydatid disease is a major healthcare problem worldwide caused by infection that commonly affects the liver. Treatments for hydatid disease depend on how advanced the disease is and if the infection is active or not. Currently, doctors decide what stage the disease is at by looking at the appearance of liver on scans and by performing blood tests. It is however still very difficult to be certain if a treatment is working and when is the right moment to start and stop medication. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning is a safe and non-invasive way of imaging the liver that can provide detailed information not just about what the liver looks like but also other information about the chemical composition of normal and diseased liver tissue. MRI is already widely used in the NHS for many liver conditions but it is unknown whether analysing the chemical composition will help decide on the stage and activity of hydatid liver disease. This study will allow comparison between MRI information about liver structure and composition with existing methods of assessing disease stage. If fluid is later obtained from the liver as part of usual clinical care (either using a needle with ultrasound or at the time of surgery), this study will also compare information about the fluid composition obtained from MRI scanning, with the results obtained when analysing the fluid in the lab. This will help to develop a more accurate way of non-invasively assessing hydatid disease in the liver, in the future.
Comparison of Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) Block and Thoracolumbar Interfascial Plane(TLIP) Block for the Management of Postoperative Pain in Spinal Surgery Lumbar vertebra surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures. After lumbar veretebra surgery, patients complain of excessive pain. Postoperative pain usually occurs in the early postoperative period and delays patient mobilization and thus lengthens hospital stay.  The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of erector spina plan(ESP) block and thoraco lumbar interfacial(TLIP) block on postoperative pain in patients with spinal surgery.
Expert Consensus Statements for the Management of a Physiologically Difficult Airway Using the Delphi Method (PDADelphi) The aim of this study is to review/identify the existing definition and management strategies for a physiologically difficult airway (PDA), to generate expert consensus on the various aspects of managing a patient with a PDA using the Delphi method, and to provide guidance to clinicians worldwide on safe tracheal intubation practices in patients with PDA to help improve patient outcomes.
Novel Hypoxia Imaging for Head and Neck Cancer: Imaging Phenotype for Personalized Treatment Tumor hypoxia is one of the physiological factors for treatment resistance and likely contributes to poor overall survival among patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Identifying hypoxic features of HNC may allow the personalizing treatment plan. The investigators propose multiparametric Hypoxia MR (HMR) imaging using diffusion, perfusion, and oxygenation as non-invasive, in-vivo imaging components of a hypoxia phenotype. Assessing the hypoxia phenotypes' expression will be critically important for characterizing and predicting CRT response among patients with advanced HNC.  A prospective cohort study will be conducted used multiparametric MR (MPMR) imaging correlated with treatment response assessed by 3 months fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The image analysis approach will be developed to incorporate FDG-PET and quantitative MRI characteristics of tumor (ADC, oxygen-enhanced T1 and T2\* maps, and volume transfer constant (Ktrans) to facilitate 3D visualization of multiparametric information. This proposed study's overarching goal is to develop and validate multiparametric HMR imaging using 18F - (fluoromisonidazole) FMISO-PET and immunohistochemistry (IHC) as the standard of references.

Infant Male Circumcision in Gaborone, Botswana, and Surrounding Areas: Feasibility, Safety and Acceptability Background: Novel HIV prevention approaches are urgently needed in Botswana and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Although adult male circumcision (MC) has been shown to reduce the heterosexual acquisition of HIV by men by about 60%, MC in infancy is optimal for its relative ease, lower cost and low rate of complications. We have conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews that suggest neonatal MC (\< 28 days of life) would be an acceptable public HIV prevention strategy in Botswana. The government of Botswana is committed to scaling up MC services in the immediate future and they plan to include neonates. Understanding decision-making around infant MC will be essential to maximize the effectiveness of this HIV prevention strategy.  Specific Aims: The investigators propose to: 1) determine the acceptability and actual uptake of neonatal MC in southeastern Botswana and identify barriers to uptake; 2) ascertain the feasibility and safety of neonatal MC in Botswana; 3) Estimate what, if any, advantages would exist for scale up of Mogen Clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc with regard to human resources, equipment needs, adverse events and acceptability to health-care providers and families in Botswana.  Study Design and Schema: The investigators will conduct structured interviews with early postpartum mothers and fathers to determine correlates of neonatal MC acceptability and uptake, defined as neonatal MC following informed consent. Male infants will be circumcised by a trained doctor in a hospital / clinic setting by one of three FDA-approved devices that are currently in use in US hospitals: Mogen clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc. Circumcision with Mogen Clamp or Plastibell will be done before 29 days of life. Circumcision with AccuCirc will be done before 11 days of life (FDA approval limit for device). The investigators will also administer questionnaires to the parents at the regular pediatric follow-up visit(s) to assess impressions of / satisfaction with the infant's procedure outcome over time. Provider impressions of the three methods will also be evaluated. Sample size will be 150 infants per arm for a total of 450 infants males circumcised (and an estimated 800 parental questionnaires).  Public Health Significance: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS state that countries with severe, generalized HIV epidemics but low rates of MC should offer this surgery as an important, evidence-based HIV prevention intervention, including among neonates. These two agencies also recommended that additional research on the most feasible, safe, and sustainable ways of scaling up MC intervention should be performed. This study will be in keeping with these recommendations.  Please note the Mogen clamp and Plastibell study arms began as a randomized trial before the initiation of the AccuCirc single-arm portion. Although the settings in which the three devices were studied were similar, the AccuCirc trial enrollment began at two sites (Gaborone and Molepolole) only after completion of the Mogen clamp and Plastibell arms, which was conducted in three sites (Gaborone, Molepolole and Mochudi). Although Lobatse was a site for the first acceptability study with mothers, no procedures were performed there.  Regarding the reported sample size: the total, final sample size includes both parents of newborn boys (because enrolled consenting parents completed questionnaires as part of this study), and boys whose parents consented to circumcision. We anticipated that not all parents who completed the questionnaire would consent to circumcising their baby; therefore, when planning the study it was necessary to estimate the number of parents who would participate in the survey (700), to achieve an enrollment of 300 neonates (therefore the initial estimate of 1000). The original study in fact enrolled 302 infants, 600 mothers and 19 fathers (total study population 921). The addition of the AccuCirc arm led to a revised estimate of total number of neonates and their parents (total=1250). The final enrollment was of 1,235 participants, that includes all the participating neonates and parents.
Volatolom Variation in Severe COPD During Hospitalization for Exacerbation and After Hospitalization (VOC-BPCO-Exa) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health issue due to its prevalence of 8% in the general population (although it is underestimated), particularly due to the number of severe patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure and the number of hospitalizations estimated at 100,000 each year. Total health insurance expenditure in 2017 for chronic respiratory diseases (excluding cystic fibrosis and cancers) was approximately €3.5 billion, including €1 billion for hospitalizations.  Hospitalizations are mainly related to a worsening of the disease (severe exacerbations mainly of viral and/or bacterial origin). Although the majority of exacerbations are treated on an outpatient basis with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids, those occurring in the most severe and often the oldest patients may require hospitalization. It should be noted that almost one out of two patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation is re-hospitalized within six months; on the other hand, age and length of stay are the two main factors of mortality in the year following hospitalization for COPD in the Intensive Care Unit. Early detection of a worsening of the health status related to COPD could allow appropriate management and avoid at least part of the hospitalizations for exacerbation with a consequent reduction of the associated morbi-mortality.  The objective of this clinical study is to determine the evolution of the profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the exhaled air (volatolom) in patients with severe COPD after hospitalization for exacerbation. This step should allow the identification of VOCs (modification of the volatolom) which would be associated with a severe COPD exacerbation, by comparing the volatolom at the acute phase of the exacerbation to the volatoloms during the progressive return to a stable state after hospitalization and to those of patients with a stabilized severe COPD (VOC-BPCO clinical study also sponsored by Foch Hospital)
Establishment of the Human Intestinal and Salivary Microbiota Biobank - Kidney Diseases This is a prospective, clinical, multicentre study aimed to collect biological samples and study microbiota from subjects suffering from chronic kidney disease and from healthy volunteers. Microbiota is a complex consortium of microorganisms, located at the mucosal level (in particular intestinal, oral and vaginal) having a key role in human health and in the onset of several diseases. Microbiota alterations have been found in several diseases (gastrointestinal, metabolic, renal, oncological, gynaecological).  The study will allow to:  * Provide biological samples (faeces, saliva, blood, urine) from healthy volunteers and patients suffering from chronic renal diseases to the first Italian microbiota biobank; * Study microorganisms using different in vitro and in vivo techniques; * Study the link between the microbiota and the disease. This study is part of the BIOMIS project (Project Code: ARS01_01220), presented as part of the "Avviso per la presentazione di progetti di ricerca industriale e sviluppo sperimentale nelle 12 aree di specializzazione individuate dal PNR 2015-2020" and admitted to funding under the National Operational Program "Ricerca e Innovazione" 2014-2020 by directorial decree of MIUR - Department for Higher Education and Research - n. 2298 of 12 September 2018. BIOMIS includes several clinical studies that enrol patients with different pathologies to collect and store biological samples and study microbiota.
Radiological Stage and Efficacy of an Intra-articular Injection of Hyaluronic Acid for the Treatment of Hallux Rigidus The hallux rigidus is the most frequent type of arthrosis at the age of 50 and beyond. For the moderate forms of the disease, the majority of the studies recommend the recourse to the viscosupplement because of its efficiency in the long term.  On the other hand, no study was focused on the impact of the anatomical severity on the clinical result of the treatment by intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid.  The present research has for objective to study the influence of the radiological severity on the result of the viscosupplement, in the conditions of daily practice, in patients affected by Hallux rigidus.  It is an open observational multicentrical prospective study realized by 20 investigators rheumatologists and liberal orthopedic surgeons. The recruitment is competitive and the study will be ended when 66 patients will have been included by taking into account a risk of trial exits or of lost of sight of 10 %.The main criterion is the influence of the radiological stage on the answer to the treatment.  Duration of inclusion 6 months. Duration of follow-up 3 months. Total duration of the study 9 months.

Evaluation of Two Surgical Strategies for Robotic Implantation of Total Knee Prostheses (Stryker), Cemented Versus Uncemented Total knee replacement surgery (TKA) is a treatment for advanced tibial-femoral osteoarthritis. This intervention is justified in case of significant discomfort and failure of medical treatment. It aims to replace the native internal and external femoro-tibial joints with a joint between a femoral implant and a tibial implant.  Implants can be cemented or cementless. The longevity of these implants depends among other things on the quality of the bone fixation of the implants. It is therefore essential that this fixation be evaluated. The advantages of an uncemented TKA are the preservation of bone stock, the absence of wear by cement debris and prolonged fixation thanks to osseointegration. These characteristics are all the more interesting in a young population.  Numerous studies have been carried out on the survival of TKA with and without cement. The results found are not unanimous and mainly concern the survival of the implants and the presence of radiological signs of loosening. In addition, no study has evaluated the results of TKA with or without cement implanted using robotic assistance. The precision provided by the robotic system could improve the results of these uncemented implants.  Very few studies are interested in the functional results according to the cementation or not of TKA. And most of these studies do not have a high level of methodological evidence.  We would like to prospectively evaluate the functional results, survival, as well as the rate of radiological border after TKA with or without cement posed with robotic assistance, in the short and medium term.

Recombinant Human Endostatin (EndostarTM) Injection in Treatment of Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer Endostatin has been widely applied for the clinical treatment of partial primary and metastatic solid tumors. Endostatin combined with chemotherapy has achieved favorable progression in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the research about the efficacy of Endostatin on breast cancer has just started. Breast cancer is a highly-differentiated solid tumor, indicating that it is also an indicator for Endostatin therapy. Additionally, after chemo- and radiotherapy, the primary nidi of patients with advanced breast cancer may also lead to rapid development of tumors in other locations. So Endostatin combined with chemotherapy can also improve the prognosis of patients with recurrent metastatic breast cancer, but there is rare any report at home and abroad. To further explore the above research, this study designed a randomized, opened and controlled clinical study to observe the clinical efficacy of EndostarTM Injection combined with GP/NP/GX/NX in the treatment of recurrent metastatic breast cancer.

Search for Fragility Indicators Among People Aged 50+ With Chronic HIV Infection The frailty and frail elderly was defined in 2001 by Fried as a physiological state of heightened vulnerability to external shocks. 5 criteria for classifying the elderly in 3 categories: frail, pre-frail and not frail. The prevalence of frailty in the general population was estimated to be 7%, 10% and 20% for over 65 years and 45% for over 85 years. This concept is explored in some chronic diseases, in order to prevent the loss of autonomy and tailor the treatment. In the carrier population of HIV, a North American retrospective study showed the frailty syndrome manifested as early as 10 years before, than in the general population. Furthermore various studies show in this specific population, increased incidence of diseases linked to age, suggesting an accelerated and premature aging.  objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of frailty defined Fried syndrome in a population of subjects aged 50 and over Holders of chronic HIV infection.
PREDICTION OF FLUID RESPONSIVENESS WITH PASSIVE LEG RISING IN PREGNANT PATIENTS WITH SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA BACKGROUND: A cornerstone of treatment in preeclampsia is to correct the potential hypovolemia with intravascular optimisation, which is usually performed as a fluid challenge. The prediction of fluid responsiveness in these patients, secondary to anatomical and physiological changes associated with pregnancy has not been established. This study aims to evaluate if Passive Leg Raising (PLR) protocol can predict fluid responsiveness in pregnant patients with severe preeclampsia.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: in 35 pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia with a clinical indication to optimise intravascular volume, . A PLR manoeuvre and a fluid challenge will be performed, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded using Bioreactance technology. Descriptive statistical analyses, Pearson chi-square test, and mean standard deviation (SD) will be calculated. Analysis of proportion was used to calculate probabilistic intersections of the interventions. The area under curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated for a delta of 12.  Objective: to evaluate the if passive leg rising protocol identifies fluid responsivness in pregnant patients with preeclampsia

Randomized Trial of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or Synchronized Nasal Ventilation in Premature Infants. Very premature infants uniformly do not have mature functioning lungs to breathe well nor mature regulation mechanisms to breathe regularly. Assistance with a mechanical respirator is common. However, prolonged use of a respirator can itself cause long-term complications. Furthermore, commonly used drugs to improve the regularity of breathing may have long-term consequence only recently recognized. This study will compare two different types of assistance using a nasally applied breathing assist device. The aim is to see which type of assistance is best at avoiding the need for both prolonged respirator use and drugs to regulate breathing.

INvestigating SIGnificant Health TrendS in the Management of Superficial Vein Thrombosis Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are related entities. Only in the last years a series of observational studies mainly conducted in France could show that ´isolated SVT´ (without concomitant deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is in fact not a benign and spontaneously healing disease but bears a potential for severe thromboembolic complications once not treated adequately. INSIGHTS-SVT study aims at collecting representative data on the current management and outcomes of SVT in Germany under real-life conditions. It will document the implementation of the recently issued national SVT guidelines issued by the Society for Angiology (DGA) and the Society for Phlebology (DGP).
Robotic Cardiac Surgery Wet Lab Simulation Study The goal of this study is to investigate validity of the wet lab robotic cardiac surgery model used for training in robotic cardiac surgery and to evaluate learning curves in trainees of different surgical specialities. The investigators hope to recruit experienced robotic cardiac surgeons (experts) and cardiac and non-cardiac surgeons with minimal robotic experience (trainees). Participants will perform three predetermined tasks common in the wet lab robotic cardiac surgery training. Participants will be evaluated at baseline for each task. From experts' performance the mastery learning level will be calculated. Trainees will perform the tasks until mastery is achieved. The investigators will then be able to evaluate validity of the wet lab model and analyze learning curves in all participants by rating their performance.
Effect of Esketamine on Abdominal Pain During TACE-HAIC in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Previous studies have confirmed that limb pain caused by oxaliplatin chemotherapy is related to spinal cord central sensitization - induced hyperalgesia through oxaliplatin activating spinal cord NMDA receptor(N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor). The investigators speculate that this may be the same as the mechanism of severe abdominal pain caused by HAIC(Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy) during oxaliplatin infusion. The analgesic effect of Esketamine is mainly related to its inhibition of NMDA receptor in spinal cord. Therefore, this study hypothesized that Esketamine can inhibit the sensitization of spinal cord center by inhibiting NMDA receptor, so as to alleviate severe abdominal pain during HAIC perfusion, and reduce abdominal pain caused by ischemia and inflammation by TACE(transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) by improving organ perfusion and anti-inflammatory effect, Therefore, it is expected that Esketamine can better alleviate acute severe abdominal pain caused by TACE-HAIC (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with Hepatic Artery Infusion Chemotherapy )treatment than sufentanil, decrease the dosage of opioids, and reduce the incidence and degree of chronic abdominal pain after treatment.
Restrictive Versus Standard Fluid Regime in Elective Minilaparotomy Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Elective minilaparatomy abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is associated with a significant number of complications involving respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and central nervous system, and mortality ranging up to 5%.

Administering Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes Transduced With a Murine T-Cell Receptor Recognizing the G12D Variant of Mutated RAS in HLA-A*11:01 Patients Background:  A new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person, grows them in a lab, genetically changes them, then gives them back to the person. Researchers think this may help attack tumors in people with certain cancers. It is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells.  Objective:  To see if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells are safe and cause tumors to shrink.  Eligibility:  Adults ages 18-72 who have cancer with a molecule on the tumors that can be recognized by the study cells  Design:  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, photography, and heart, lung, and lab tests.  An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a large vein in the chest.  Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will divide the blood and collect white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm.  A few weeks later, participants will have a hospital stay. They will:  * Get 2 chemotherapy medicines by IV over 5 days. * Get the changed cells through the catheter. Get up to 9 doses of a medicine to help the cells. They may get a shot to stimulate blood cells. * Recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. They will provide blood samples.  Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.  Participants will have several follow-up visits over 2 years. They will repeat most of the screening tests and may have leukapheresis.  Participants blood will be collected for several years.
Evaluation of The Effect of Bupivacaine (Marcaine) in Reducing Early Post Tonsillectomy Pain Research Methodology:  It will be a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, intra-individual study in which one tonsillar fossa will be the tested side, and the other fossa will be the control. And the tested side will be packed with bupivacaine for five minutes. In the other hand, the controlled side will be packed for five minutes with gauze soaked in normal saline. The selection of the tested side and controlled side will be randomized based on the last digit in the medical record number (i.e. if the last digit is even then the tested side is the right and if the last digit is odd then the tested side is the left). Pain evaluation will be by visual analog scale and it will be in frequency of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post-op.

Xydalba Utilization Registry in Germany This observational study will collect data on the use of the drug Xydalba® in daily clinical practice in Germany. Such observational studies are also referred to as registries. The sponsor of the study is Correvio International Sárl, based in Switzerland.  Xydalba® contains the active substance dalbavancin, a remedy for a certain type of bacterial pathogens (so-called "gram positive bacteria") which cause the disease. Active ingredients against bacteria are also called antibiotics.  Correvio wants to know which patients received the drug and how the disease went. The treatment places where you got Xydalba, ie clinic, intensive care unit or elsewhere should be recorded. In addition, it is important in this type of medication to track whether the pathogens are changing in any way. Any safety-relevant events (such as side effects) that have occurred during treatment should be investigated by the sponsor and submitted to the competent European authorities.

Corticosteroids for COVID-19 This trial is an interventional, randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive clinical trial in outpatients with symptomatic microbiologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, in stable clinical condition, and increased levels of serum C-reactive protein. The hypothesis of this study is that early administration of prednisone for 7 days in patients with evidence of increased C-reactive protein will decrease the progression of COVID-19, prevent clinical deterioration, and hospital admission. Objectives: Primary Objective: To evaluate if early administration of corticosteroids in non-hospitalized participants with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection with compatible clinical symptoms and increased C-reactive protein can prevent hospital admission or early death
Microvascular and Fibrosis Imaging Study In this study, Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF), Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI), Orthogonal Polarization Spectral Imaging (OPSI), Nail fold video capillaroscopy (NVC) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be used to assess differences in microvascular function and density of oral mucosa and skin in subjects with 1) autoimmune diseases with cutaneous involvement: systemic sclerosis (SSc), morphea, dermatomyositis, cutaneous lupus and vasculitis, 2) sickle cell disease (SCD) and 3) chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) compared to healthy subjects. The microvascular changes will be compared to overall treatment response in patients with scleroderma and chronic GVHD as assessments will be made before and after the patients start treatment for their diseases and determine if these imaging techniques provide valuable and reproducible data when assessing a patient's response to treatment for those diseases. In addition, the application of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) in determining cutaneous thickness in patients with SSc, GVHD and morphea will be evaluated.  The investigators hypothesize that the vascular and dermal structures are altered in patients with autoimmune disease, SCD and chronic GVHD. In addition, they hypothesize that imaging modalities such as LDF, LDI, OCT, NVC, OPSI and ARFI can quantify such structural alterations and can be used to 1) detect early disease activity, 2) quantify and assess response to therapy and 3) quantify and correlate with overall disease activity.

Echocardiographic Detection of Extravascular Lung Water Increase During Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation Switching from positive airway pressure ventilation to spontaneous ventilation during weaning from mechanical ventilation, pulmonary edema may occur and in this case, doppler echocardiographic (U/S) indices of cardiac dysfunction correlates with the concentration of fluid in interstitial space.  Forty consecutive mechanically ventilated critical ill patients who fulfill criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation, will be included in this study. All patients will be evaluated daily and when the patients fulfill weaning criteria them they will undergo a 2-hour spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) through a T-piece.  Before and after SBT cardiopulmonary function will be assessed by thermodilution and echocardiography. In patients with preserved LV systolic function, an echocardiographic index of diastolic dysfunction (E/Em ratio) before preforming SBT may identify high risk patients for increasing extravascular water in weaning.  In addition, the investigators expect to find positive correlations (p\<0.05) between pulmonary extravascular lung water and echocardiographic indices (such as E/Em ratio) during SBT.
Beta Blockers for Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Children This study will determine the safety and feasibility of using a β-blocker (in this case carvedilol) in the treatment of pediatric patients with Left Heart Failure (LHF) in children with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Carvedilol affects the nervous system, the same system that is highly activated in response to stress in patients with PAH. Each patient is administered a dosage of carvedilol, according to their weight. This dosage is increased incrementally over the span of the study, if the patient responds well to the drug. The study will determine whether the potential adverse side effects of carvedilol outweigh the possible positive results in reducing LHF. The hypothesis of this study predicts that carvedilol will have positive effects in treating LHF, similar to their use in treatment of Right Heart Failure (RHF). This is a single-centered pilot study. Each patient will be studied for approximately 31 weeks.

MRI QSM Imaging for Iron Overload The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel technique for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) of the abdomen, for non-invasive assessment of liver iron deposition. In this work, study team will develop and optimize advanced data acquisition and image reconstruction methods to enable QSM of the abdomen. Further, investigators will determine the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of abdominal QSM for iron quantification in patients with liver iron overload.  Excessive accumulation of iron in various organs, including the liver, which affects both adult and pediatric populations, is toxic and requires treatment aimed at reducing body iron stores. Accurate assessment of liver iron concentration is critical for the detection and staging of iron overload as well as for longitudinal monitoring during treatment.  In summary, this project will develop a novel MRI-based QSM technique designed for the abdomen and will validate it in pediatric and adult patients with liver iron overload. Upon successful validation, QSM will provide accurate, repeatable, and reproducible quantification of LIC based on a fundamental property of tissue.

Emotion Detectives In-Out: Feasibility and Efficacy of a Blended Version of the Unified Protocol for Children The goal of this clinical trial is to test the efficacy of a blended format (i.e., a combination of face-to-face and online sessions into one integrated treatment protocol) of the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children (UP-C) in a sample of children aged between 7 and 12 years with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder or with clinically significant levels of anxiety.  The main questions it aims to answer are:  * Is the proposed intervention (named Emotion Detectives In-Out) feasible and acceptable among Portuguese children with anxiety disorders and their parents? * Is the Emotion Detectives In-Out intervention as effective as an evidence-based intervention for children's anxiety disorders in reducing anxiety symptomatology and changing secondary outcomes? * What are the key predictors of adherence to the Emotion Detectives In-Out intervention? * What are the key predictors of treatment outcomes?  Participants (children and one parent/legal representative) will:  * Participate in an initial interview with a clinical psychologist, who will assess if children and parents meet eligibility criteria. * Complete an assessment protocol before, during, and after the intervention, as well as three months later. * Be randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: experimental (Emotion Detectives In-Out) or active control (Coping Cat). * Participate in one of the two psychological interventions. Researchers will compare the experimental and control groups to see if the Emotion Detectives In-Out intervention is equally efficacious as the Coping Cat intervention.
Phantom Limb Pain Triggered by Micturition Phantom Limb Pain ( PLP) is pain that is perceived and referred to a region of the body that is no longer present. in most patients, severity and frequency of phantom pain attacks gradually decrease over several weeks to 2 years following amputation, however in 5-10% significant pain remains a serious problem.  It has been hypothesized, that deprivation of various inputs from the limbs to the brain cause an abnormal neuro-signature to be produced generating cortical maladaptive neuroplasticity and reorganization. Areas representing the amputated body part are taken over by neighboring representational zones in both the somatosensory and motor cortex generating pain in absence of stimuli.  A seminal paper published by Lotze et al "Phantom movements and pain: a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in upper limb amputees. - participants had to pucker their lips at a metronome-paced speed while functional magnetic resonance images were taken. Only in amputees with phantom-limb pain did a shift of the mouth representation into the hand representation occur; those without pain and the healthy control do not display a similar shift.  Scarce reports have been made on a similar phenomenon- micturition induced lower limb phantom pain.  We speculate that a similar maladaptive central nerve system (CNS) plasticity in which this genital representation would invade cortical areas with somatotopic affiliation to the lower extremity could be implicated in the pathophysiology of this phenomenon.
Relation Between Cachexia, Diabetes and periNeural Invasion in PANcreatic Cancer- Biomarkers Substudy The purpose of this study is to determine the interrelationship between cachexia, neural invasion and diabetes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Thus the investigators propose to identify the protein expression levels of Activin and Midkine in plasma of patients with different stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with healthy patients and to evaluate the possible correlation with diabetes, tumor size and tumor stage.
Nutraceutical Support With Omega-3 Although evidence have clearly proved that intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists prevents vision loss and may even improve visual acuity in patients with neovascular AMD, a significant percentage of patients continue to lose visual acuity. Moreover, monthly intravitreal injections represent a burden for society as well as the caregiver.  Combination therapy with either topical 0.1% pranoprofen or nutraceutical support with AREDS2 formula plus omega-3 might act synergistically with intravitreal injection, offering valuable therapeutic support to aflibercept injections in patients requiring long-term treatment.
Oxaliplatin Adjuvant Chemotherapy After Curative Resection of Primary Colon Cancer According to general medical guidelines, adjuvant chemotherapy is used after curative resection of high-risk stage II or III primary colon cancer. However, there exist limitations using clinical trial data acquired from highly selected subjects in a controlled environment. For example, patients aged over 70 years old were in many cases excluded from clinical trials resulting in insufficient data on the efficacy of therapies including oxaliplatin in aged patients, and the source data of the medical guidelines did not fully reflect the conditions of Korean patients. In addition, suggestions are continuously being submitted for existing therapies with modified administration periods and methods with the aim to search for the optimum effect over side effects. Discussions are also held on meta analyses results that imply the need to apply slightly different approaches through small groups of patient and disease factors. As there are more diverse adjuvant therapy protocols that can be applied to post-surgery colon cancer patients, it is necessary to figure out the patterns of adjuvant chemotherapies actually used in Korean medical practices. Also, in order to complement the limitation of external validity of the existing base clinical data, a multifaceted exploratory analysis will be conducted by making follow-up observations on patterns, prognosis results, quality of life, adverse effects, etc. of post-surgery adjuvant chemotherapies actually used in around 30 sites in Korea under the noninterventional observational study conditions.

Use of a Compliant Balloon for Large Bore Catheter Navigation in Mechanical Thrombectomy for Stroke: a Retrospective Study The superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion compared to standard medical therapy alone has been demonstrated by several randomized clinical trials and become the standard of care for these patients. A direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT) for the endovascular treatment of stroke using a large-bore catheter has been reported to be an effective method of achieving MT. Recent studies reported that ADAPT is as efficient and safe as stent retrievers, with a similar successful recanalization rate, but may have better functional outcomes, fewer procedure related-adverse events, and a tendency for faster revascularization compared to the stent-retriever thrombectomy.  However, navigation of a large-bore aspiration catheter is not always possible due to unsuccessful passage of the ophthalmic artery origin ("ledge effect") or tortuous vascular anatomy. The coaxial technique comprises guiding the large-bore catheter with a smaller inner catheter and can facilitate distal access. However, there is a gap between the inner catheter and the distal tip of the large-bore outer catheter that creates a risk of damaging the vessel wall and causing dissection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Even with this coaxial technique, it is not always possible to reach the clot site with the large-bore catheter. To decrease the gap between the two catheters, several authors have used, in place of the inner microcatheter, a compliant balloon catheter positioned and inflated at the distal tip of the large-bore catheter. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADAPT assisted by a compliant balloon (ADAPT-AB) when ADAPT using the coaxial technique fails to reach the clot site.

Sedation and Analgesia Using PFK Versus General Anesthesia in Urological Procedures Anesthesia in urological surgeries might constitute a great challenge to anesthesiologists. Especially that a great proportion of these patients are elderly with a lot of comorbidities. This put these patients at the risk of developing medical adverse events after being anesthetized by general anesthesia. The aim of this study is to compare between intravenous sedation with analgesia versus general anesthesia in patients undergoing urological surgical procedures.
Variance of Oral Methadone Dosage: Description of Implicated Factors The purpose of this study is to describe clinical, pharmacokinetic and genetic factors associated with the variance of oral methadone dosage for patients at the steady state of heroin dependence maintenance treatment. The hypothesis is that the investigators can predict 70% of the variance with few factors, including CYP 3A4 function measured with oral midazolam challenge.
Evaluating the Feasibility and Effectiveness of Using a Smartphone Application During Rehabilitation in Patients After Total Knee Replacement Despite best efforts to provide standardized and effective rehabilitation sessions post-total knee replacement (TKR), there are a few factors that may result in sub-optimal recovery in this group of patients. There is a need to develop innovative rehabilitation strategies that (i) provide patients with accurate cues allowing for better compliance and exercise performance, (ii) allow for therapists to ensure continuity of care, monitor compliance, and identify deviation from recovery trajectories post-discharge, prior to their first outpatient appointment, and (iii) reduce reliance on manpower and variability during rehabilitation sessions.  Technological solutions that empower patients and allow home-based rehabilitation to take place without the need for real-time human supervision could be the key to improving effectiveness and lowering costs. A mobile application which detects key landmarks on the body for human pose estimation will allow patients to perform their rehabilitation exercises with real-time feedback allowing for proper execution of the exercises. Physiotherapists will be able to access the data generated from the exercise session via a command centre to monitor patients' recovery progress and compliance.  The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a mobile application during rehabilitation in patients after a TKR surgery. The secondary aim is to study the effects of using a mobile application during rehabilitation on knee functional status, exercise self-efficacy, and treatment satisfaction after TKR surgery.
Developing Memory Reconsolidation Blockers as Novel Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatments Despite substantial therapeutic advances, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains difficult to treat. One promising new area of research is in post-reactivation pharmacologic intervention, which is based upon the concept of blockade of memory reconsolidation. Recent animal research suggests that reactivation (retrieval) of a stored memory can return it to a labile (alterable) state from which it must be restabilized in order to persist. This process is called "reconsolidation," and various drugs have been found to block it in animals. This blockade may lead to a weakening of the original memory trace.  The aim of this study is to pilot the effect of mifepristone on physiologic responding during traumatic imagery. Although mifepristone is widely and safely used to cause a medical abortion, it is also a powerful stress hormone receptor blocker. These stress hormones, called glucocorticoids, may enhance memory (re)consolidation. Indeed, a recent study in animals reported that mifepristone blocked reconsolidation of context-conditioned fear in rats.  Reconsolidation blockade is a two-stage process. First, the memory must be destabilized by recalling it. Second, reconsolidation of the memory must be blocked by a drug. Memory traces formed under stressful conditions may resist destabilization and thus are inaccessible to reconsolidation blockers. However, when a reconsolidation blocker was paired with d-cycloserine (DCS) in animals that had been trained under stressful conditions, reconsolidation blockade became successful. These results suggest that DCS promotes the destabilization of resistant memory traces. The traumatic memories of individuals with PTSD may be particularly resistant to destabilization. Therefore, this study will compare mifepristone paired with DCS to placebo controls.  The same script-driven traumatic imagery method validated in previous studies of propranolol in this lab will be used. Briefly, subjects with PTSD will describe their traumatic event during a script preparation session, which will reactivate the memory. They will then receive a) mifepristone and DCS or b) placebo. A week later, they will engage in script-driven mental imagery of their traumatic event while physiologic responses (heart rate, sweating, etc) are measured. This is a pilot study so there are no formal hypotheses. The aim is to estimate effect sizes for mifepristone and to compare them with effect sizes for propranolol from this lab's previous work.

Physiological Impact of Surgical Mask and N95 Mask on Obese Operating Room During the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, in order to reduce the risk of infection among healthcare workers, healthcare workers are usually required to wear N95 masks for extended periods of time in high-risk environments. The long-term use of masks by medical staff has been proven to be related to various symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, facial skin disease symptoms, and other occupational disturbances . Our previous research found that among healthy anesthesiologists with normal weight, wearing a Surgical mask for more than 2h can significantly reduce SpO2 and increase respiratory rate, but the range of change has no clinical significance . Rebmann et al. investigated the physiological effects of N95 masks on healthcare workers, and the results showed a statistically significant increase in PetCO2 levels among 10 intensive care unit nurses who used N95 masks on a 12 hour shift. Recently, it has been confirmed that prolonged use of N95 masks can cause changes in Gas exchange, including a decrease in plasma pH and venous partial pressure of oxygen (PvO2), and a slight increase in EtCO2.  Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that poses a risk to health and can cause baseline lung function impairment and decreased immune function. According to the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO), people with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2 are classified as obese. Research shows that obese patients are the population with the highest risk of SARS CoV-2 infection related incidence rate and mortality. Research has shown that healthcare workers who work long hours are more likely to become obese due to changes in body regulation, metabolism, and stress. Long term use of N95 masks by medical staff may lead to a certain degree of insufficient ventilation and/or CO2 re breathing. Obesity itself has a significant impact on the heart and lungs, but the potential physiological effects of long-term wearing of N95 masks on obese healthcare workers have not been studied. The purpose of our study is to determine the abnormal gas exchange and physiological changes of obese doctors and nurses in the operating room who wear Surgical mask and N95 mask for 4 hours.
A Phase I /II Study of the Protease Inhibitor Indinavir (MK-0639) in Children With HIV Infection This is a phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerance of the protease inhibitor indinavir (MK-0639), alone and then in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy in children with HIV infection. Indinavir sulfate (the capsule formulation) has been shown to have potent antiviral activity and an acceptable safety profile in adults. HIV-infected children who have not received prior antiretroviral therapy, and children who have become refractory to prior therapy, or who have experienced toxicity to prior therapy, will be included. In addition, we will explore viral and CD4 cell kinetics before starting therapy and following exposure to antiretroviral agents.  The study will be conducted in three parts.  1. In order to help interpret the antiviral activity of indinavir, the virologic and immunologic profile of children will be studied within 2 weeks prior to starting the therapeutic part. For children who have never been treated, this will be before the initiation of any antiretroviral therapy and for children who have already received antiretroviral therapy, this will be done during the initial "wash-out" phase that is routinely interposed between two different treatment regimens. 2. The initial 16 weeks of therapy will then evaluate the toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of single drug therapy with indinavir. 3. Subsequently, all children who are able to tolerate the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine (i.e., have no prior history of intolerance to one of these two agents) will be treated with these two reverse transcriptase inhibitors in addition to the protease inhibitor indinavir. Zidovudine and lamivudine will be added after 16 weeks at a fixed dosage. Toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of indinavir will also be investigated after combination therapy. All patients who wish to remain in this study after 96 weeks of therapy and who do not meet off study criteria will be permitted to receive extended treatment with their current indinavir combination therapy for an additional 48 weeks.  The study will determine the pharmacokinetic profile of indinavir, given as single drug or in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine. It will assess the preliminary antiviral and clinical activity by monitoring clinical status, viral burden in plasma, and markers of immunologic status. Based on safety and preliminary efficacy results from studies performed in adults, we will study three dose levels which are expected to result in drug levels above the IC95 of HIV-1 for all or most of the dosing interval.
Bariatric Surgery and Pharmacokinetics of Atomoxetine Changes to gastric pH, gastric emptying time, gastrointestinal transit-time or the pre-systemic metabolizing effect of enzymes secreted in the mucosa may all alter the pharmacokinetics of medicines. These factors are potentially influenced by bariatric surgery. Little is so far known about how gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy impacts the biological availability of medication. In this study the pharmacokinetic effects of bariatric surgery on atomoxetine are investigated.

Photoactive Porphyrins (PAP) Levels After Topical Visonac Application in Acne Patients Open, prospective, randomized, single-centre study in patients with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris. Three circular areas with a diameter of 4 cm, each circle including at least 4 inflammatory lesions, will be selected in acne-affected areas in the face. One area should be identified on each cheek and one area should be identified on the forehead. The minimum distance between the three areas should be at least 4 cm. For each patient the three areas will be randomized to either a pre-treatment cleaning using a wipe containing an ethyl alcohol solution(one area) or a cleansing wipe containing saline water (two areas), before application of the Visonac cream. One of the areas cleaned with saline wipe will also be occluded with a transparent dressing (Tegaderm) during the incubation time. In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy will be performed in the three areas before cream application, and at 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h and 3 h after cream application. After the last fluorescence spectroscopy reading, the cream should be wiped off and the patient should protect the three areas from sunlight, prolonged, or intense light for 2 days.  The study was extended with additionally 8 patients to explore the photoactive porphyrin levels over a 24 hour period:  The patients will clean their face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser before cream application. For each patient the three areas will be randomized to Visonac 80mg left on the skin for 24 hours and Visonac (MAL8%) to be wiped of after 1 hour.  In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy will be performed at all three areas before cream application, and at 2h, 3 h, 4h, 5h, 8h, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h, 15 and 24h after cream application. The exact time points may be adjusted based on the result from the previously included patients. All patients will be instructed to protect the three areas from sunlight, prolonged, or intense light for 2 days.

Xpert Active Case-finding Trial 2: Community-based Active Case-finding for Tuberculosis in South Africa TB kills most people with HIV in Africa. TB is out of control. Radically different approaches to deal with the disease is therefor needed. It is known that intensified case finding works in high HIV prevalence environments. However, the poor performance of conventional diagnostics makes the strategy costly and unpalatable for policy makers. If it can be shown that a package of new diagnostic technologies significantly enhances ease and speed of diagnosis, and time to treatment initiation when using intensified case finding, this will usher the way for further studies and policy adjustments to tackle TB. Thus, the work, if found to be useful, could have major policy implications  The purpose of this study will be to determine the diagnostic yield, impact and feasibility of community-based intensified TB case finding using symptom screening, point-of-care TB testing (Xpert Omni), point-of-care HIV testing and CD4 count (Alere PIMA), if HIV-infected, together with a clinic-based diagnostic package (sputum smear microscopy, MGIT sputum culture, and digital chest radiograph). Additionally, the study will assess the infectiousness of previously undiagnosed TB cases in the community using cough aerosol sampling technology (CASS) and will determine the genomic, transcriptomic and lipidomic profile of TB isolates from patients undergoing CASS sampling. The cost-effectiveness of using a novel TB diagnostic platform (Xpert Omni) for intensified case finding compared to conventional methods will also be evaluated.  \~6000 people will be screened to enrol 600 participants with suspected TB. It is expected that using the GeneXpert® Omni POC mobile clinic of 2- to 3-person team of healthcare workers in an inexpensive panel van will substantially reduce the time to treatment initiation, and the proportion of individuals initiating and completing TB treatment. Investigators will also review and follow up Household contacts of active TB participants.  As part of the study investigators will also contribute data and specimens to the RePORT consortium (Regional Prospective Observational Research for Tuberculosis), that aims to create a multinational bank with the primary objective of providing specimens and data to RePORT consortia biomarker researchers and their collaborators over the next decade to achieve a better understanding of the prognosis of TB disease; and the pathogenesis of progression from TB exposure to disease.

HOPE With Cytokine Filtration in Liver Transplantation (Cyto-HOPE) Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is unavoidably typical of solid organ transplantation.  Post-reperfusion syndrome (PRS), characterized by hemodynamic instability at reperfusion of the implanted graft, is a possible complication of liver transplantation. For sure, IRI plays a fundamental role in the multifactorial pathogenesis of PRS.  IRI and PRS are associated with a higher risk of early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and, consequently, graft failure.  Liver grafts from both extended criteria donors (ECD) and donation after circulatory death (DCD) are particularly susceptible to IRI and, accordingly, are at higher risk of PRS, EAD and graft failure. Anyway, in the present scenario of organ shortage, such donors greatly contribute to enlarge the organ pool. So, various strategies have been developed for the purpose of a safer use of this kind of grafts. Among them, ex vivo hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) reduces IRI and is beneficial for high-risk liver grafts.  The pathogenesis of IRI is an extremely complex downstream inflammation process, involving many different cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. In particular, tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-alfa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are crucial in the development of IRI in liver transplantation.  In experimental models, cytokine filtration during ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) was proved to be safe and effective in reducing inflammatory response and, thus, pulmonary edema development.  Since  * in liver transplantation, IRI and PRS are associated with a higher risk of EAD and graft failure * liver grafts from ECD and DCD are particularly susceptible to IRI and are at higher risk of PRS, EAD and graft failure * HOPE of high-risk liver grafts reduces IRI * in solid organ transplantation, various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors are involved in the pathogenesis of IRI * in experimental models of EVLP, cytokine filtration was proved to reduce inflammatory response and subsequent organ damage,  our hypothesis is that cytokine filtration during HOPE of high-risk liver grafts may potentiate the beneficial effects of HOPE, further reducing IRI and, consequently, further decreasing the incidence of PRS and EAD.  So, the aim of this study is to verify the feasibility and safety of cytokine filtration during end-ischemic HOPE of liver grafts.
Study to Evaluate the Effect of Short Treatment With Nutritional Supplementation Standardized Innovative Formula, on Growth and Weight Gain in Short and Lean Prepubertal Children Study design:  Double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study.The proposed study will consist of two main segments:  1. Segment 1 is aimed to assess the effect of 6-12 months treatment with nutritional supplementation standardized formula, in short and lean prepubertal children on weight SDS, height SDS, BMI SDS and growth velocity 2. Segment 2 is aimed to explore the eating behavior of idiopathic short stature and lean prepubertal children against their sibling who have a normal height and body weight and to find out whether there is a difference in eating patterns and quality of life between idiopathic short stature and lean prepubertal children and children with normal height and body weight  Segment 1  Population:  200 subjects and controls will be recruited to segment 1 of the proposed study, 100 at each group.  Participants will be recruited from healthy children who will be referred to either the institute for endocrinology or the gastroenterology unit, at Schneider Children's Medical Center for growth assessment, due to low height and weight, in whom, no gastrointestinal morbidity or other underlying cause was found.

Sleeping Questionaire  Segment 2:  86 subjects and controls will be recruited to segment 2 of the proposed study  Population:  Short and lean prepubertal children participating at segment 1 of the study and who are at study entry under 10th percentile in height, when the weight percentile is equal or smaller to the height percentile. Only participants from segment 1 who have siblings with normal height and body weight for age and gender, will be able to participate in segment 2 of the study  Control group 1:  Sibling of participants in segment 1 of the study, who have a normal height- above 25th percentile and normal BMI for age and gender- above 5th percentile and under 85th percentile.  Control group 2:  Healthy children from the community who have a normal height above 25th percentile and normal BMI for age and gender above 5th percentile and under 85th percentile  Segment 2 of the study will be designed as a case- control study and will focus on the eating patterns, sleeping patterns and quality of life of participants at segment 1 at time 0 month of the study, before the beginning of the nutrition intervention. These findings will be compared to data of a control group, which will be comprised of siblings of participants in segment 1, with normal height and body weight which are matched in age.
Time-restricted Eating in Morning Chronotype Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent conditions worldwide, despite active research of new interventions over decades. Current interventions include medications or bariatric surgery, but these approaches cannot be used in all patients and require clear indications and a close multidisciplinary management. Therefore most patients and physicians rely on lifestyle interventions, focusing on a balanced diet and physical exercise.  Recent studies have uncovered that energy metabolism is also regulated by circadian rhythms, which depend on spontaneous diurnal oscillations of the central clock, retinal sensing of ambient light, and daily feeding-fasting cycles. The chronotype has an influence on behavioral patterns, where some people describe that they are more alert in the morning or in the evening: The morning or evening chronotypes, respectively. However, in modern societies, many people are exposed to external cues in misalignment with their circadians clocks. The mismatch between the individual chronotype and the social/work life can lead to metabolic disorders.  Time-restricted eating (TRE), i.e. energy intake limited to certain windows of time without restricting calories, is an appealing approach because it proposes to realign the circadian clocks with external cues provided by the timing of food intake, thus leading to better metabolic outcomes.  The investigators speculate that the TRE intervention needs to be personalized to reach efficacy in a broader population. To tailor the TRE intervention to each individual and harmonize their eating patterns in accordance to their chronotype, the investigators plan to test early TRE vs. late TRE vs. active control in overweight and obese individuals with morning chronotype.

Assessing Safety of Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19) Messenger RNA (mRNA) Vaccine Administration in the Setting of a Previous Adverse Reaction This study will evaluate the safety of administering an additional dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or mRNA bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine to individuals who have had adverse reactions to a previous dose or administering an initial dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with a personal history of allergic reaction. In addition, this study will evaluate the safety of administering an initial or additional dose or bivalent booster of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to individuals experiencing an adverse reaction to a natural COVID-19 infection ("long COVID").  Eligible participants enrolled in this trial will receive an initial or additional dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 bivalent vaccine. Participants will also be required to have 1-2 in person visits along with phone call follow up visits.  We hypothesize that individuals who have had adverse reactions to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will tolerate an additional dose of the primary mRNA vaccine or bivalent booster, as indicated, and those with a personal history of allergic reaction will tolerate an initial dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. We also hypothesize that those individuals experiencing an adverse reaction will tolerate an initial or additional dose of a primary mRNA COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, as indicated.  The study hypothesizes that individuals that have had adverse reactions to a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine will tolerate an additional dose and those with a personal history of allergic reaction will tolerate vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

PAD Screening Study Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) due to atherosclerotic narrowing of arteries of the lower limb is common and associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The prevalence of PAD increases with age affecting approximately 10% of population age \>60 years and nearly 50% age \>85 years. However, the awareness of PAD is poor with less than 5% of patients with PAD aware of their condition; and the condition is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Clinical diagnosis of PAD can be difficult because up to 50% of patients do not complain of overt symptoms such as intermittent claudication (IC) and critical limb ischemia (CLI). The prognosis of patients with PAD is not benign irrespective of symptoms. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease where 30% to 50% of patients with PAD have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and they share common risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. In the multi-national REACH registry, 1 in 5 patients with PAD experienced CV death, MI, stroke, or hospitalization within 1 year which is even higher than patients with CAD or CVD. Screening may increase early detection of PAD and provide opportunity to identify concomitant CV diseases and/or risk factors, earlier treatment and hence reduction. in adverse CV events. However, there is lack of an accurate and cost-effective assessment tool for PAD screening. Resting Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) which measures the difference in blood pressure between the arm and the ankle as a ratio is the most widely used method to diagnose PAD. An ABI \<0.9 is diagnostic of obstructive lower limb PAD with sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 80-100%. ABI performed with exercise (i.e. exercise ABI) has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield of resting ABI when the clinical suspicion for PAD is high and the resting ABI is normal. Exercise is usually performed with a treadmill or active pedal plantar-flexion (APP) when patient is unable to walk on the treadmill. Resting and exercise ABI measurement can be performed in an outpatient setting but is time consuming, and requires technical training and special equipment such as Doppler ultrasonic velocity signal probe which is not readily available in the primary care setting. This has led to under-utilization of ABI for the diagnosis of PAD despite strong guideline recommendations and unsuitable as a screening tool in the primary care setting. Other diagnostic tests for PAD such as duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance or computed tomography angiography are even less readily accessible, costly and can potentially causes harm to patients in the form of radiation and contrast reaction. Questionnaires such as the Rose Questionnaire or Edinburgh Questionnaire have been validated to identify PAD patients with claudication symptoms. Although these questionnaires have high specificity of \>90%, their sensitivity is much lower at 20-30%.They are also time consuming to administer at scale in the outpatient setting. Therefore, questionnaires alone are not widely adopted for PAD screening in the primary care setting. Recently, a single claudication question has been proposed as a simpler and easier to administer screening tool for PAD which has high specificity but is also limited by low sensitivity.Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for an alternative assessment tool for PAD screening that is more sensitive than currently available claudication questionnaires and can be easily administered in the primary care setting. In this study, we aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a novel assessment tool consisting of a single claudication question combined with symptom-limited APP test in detection of PAD using resting and/or exercise ABI as the reference. This screening tool is simple to use and has the potential to be self administered without supervision whereby reducing time and costs of screening.

Comparison of Central Venous Catheters With Silver Nanoparticles Versus Conventional Catheters Bloodstream infections are common in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). The need of a central venous line increases the risk of bacteremia and central venous catheter (CVC) related infections. The use of catheters coated and/or impregnated with different antimicrobial agents has been proposed to reduce the risk of such infections. However, results obtained so far did not reach enough clinical relevance to consider these medicated catheters as a valid alternative to the conventional ones.  The aim of this comparative randomized study is to assess the ability of recently developed silver ion-releasing central venous catheters in preventing associated infections in comparison with the conventional ones.  Experimental groups are defined as follows:  * Group A: patients treated with standard, triple lumen, non medicated catheters * Group B: patients treated with triple lumen catheters impregnated with silver nanoparticles

Compare the frequency distribution of the number of patients with reduction in finger contracture to within 0-5 degrees of normal (zero degrees) and the number who require re-treatment with open-label collagenase after treatment with these regimens.
Perioperative Examination of Inflammatory Markers in Relation to Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Melanoma; a Pilot Study We want to test if an association between sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLBN) and a systemic inflammatory response can be made.
Anti-thymocyte Globulins for Graft-versus-host Disease Prophylaxis Age is a risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The incidence of acute GVHD is significantly higher in patients at 40 years of age or more than those at 18 to 39 years of age after allo-SCT. It was found that Anti-thymocyte globulins can be used for prophylaxis of both acute and chronic GVHD after allo-SCT.Prophylaxis of GVHD using ATG in patients at 40 years of age or more in matched sibling allo-SCT settings might significantly decrease the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and the incidence of late effect after transplantation.
Central Venous Pressure Monitoring and Prognosis of High-risk Operating Patients While central venous pressure measurement is used to guide fluid management in high risk surgical patients during perioperative period, the relationship between the value of central venous pressure and organ dysfunction and prognosis of high-risk operating patients is unknow. In this study, we conducted a retrospective study of the relationship between the initial levels of CVP with organ dysfunction, the severity of illness, the length of ICU stay, and prognosis of critically ill patients.
A Study of the Effects of Sarcosine on Symptoms and Brain Glycine Levels in People With Schizophrenia The NMDA receptor has been identified as having a role in substance use disorders as well as in schizophrenia. One example of the former is nicotine's effect on dopaminergic activity not only by increasing the release of dopamine in the Midbrain reward centers, but also through less direct mechanisms affecting alpha-7 nicotinic receptors, NMDA receptors, and Glycine, a co-agonist for the NMDA receptors. In terms of schizophrenia, it has been hypothesized that NMDA receptor hypofunction plays a role in the mechanism for negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in these patients. The NMDA hypofunction may be reversed with increased synaptic glycine availability.  Sarcosine, or n-methyl-glycine, is a GlyT-1 and System A transport inhibitor actions which could be expected to increase the availability of glycine, in the synaptic space. Sarcosine is a dietary supplement which could be found in several food items such as egg yolks and turkey.  Our collaborative team has developed a novel, non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technique for measuring brain glycine changes that allows us to study glycine homeostasis. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of sarcosine (n-methyl-glycine) on brain glycine concentrations. It is our hypothesis that oral sarcosine, at a dose of 2 grams per day, will be well tolerated and associated with increased brain glycine concentrations. It is our secondary exploratory hypothesis that increases in brain glycine will be associated with behavioral signs of increased NMDA and dopamine activity. This modulation could have future therapeutic potential for disorders of hedonic and cognitive function.
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Liquid Hydroxyurea in Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia Hydroxyurea (HU) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults with sickle cell anemia. Hydroxyurea has also been tested and used with children with sickle cell anemia. However, there are not many studies describing the disposition of drug in children less than 5 years old. The FDA has requested this study to better understand how children ages 2 to 17 years with sickle anemia absorb and eliminate the drug (this is called pharmacokinetics). The investigators will measure how much Hydroxyurea (HU) gets into the bloodstream at different time points after taking this medication.
The FLIP-1 Study: Vaginal Lactobacillus Supplementation in Women at High Risk of Preterm Birth Preterm birth (PTB) is the primary cause of infant death worldwide. It has been shown that a vaginal microbiota deplete in Lactobacillus species is a risk factor for preterm labour. Conversely a vaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus appears to be protective for these adverse outcomes. A wide range of 'over the counter' Lactobacillus spp. containing products targeted at 'vaginal health' and formulated for vaginal administration are available, but most of them do not contain vaginal species of Lactobacillus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether vaginal supplementation with L. crispatus CTV-05 is associated with colonisation.
Setmelanotide (RM-493), Melanocortin-4 Receptor (MC4R) Agonist, in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) and Alström Syndrome (AS) Participants With Moderate to Severe Obesity This pivotal, phase 3 study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of setmelanotide, a potent melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) agonist, for the treatment of obesity and hyperphagia in participants with Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) or Alström syndrome (AS). The study's primary efficacy endpoint is to evaluate the proportion of participants (≥ 12 years of age at baseline) who lose ≥ 10% of their baseline body weight following approximately (\~) 52 weeks of treatment with setmelanotide compared to a historical control rate.

Immunity After Cochlear Implantation and Perilymph Molecular Profiles in Sensorineural Hearing Loss Many patients receiving cochlear implant (CI) have some residual hearing prior to implantation surgery. However, approximately one third of them will lose it in next 6 months after cochlear implantation. Although the mechanisms involved in the residual audition loss remain unknown, animal experiments suggest the role of inflammatory or immune reaction in the cochlea. The goal of this project is to search in the perilymph (a fluid which fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani of the cochlea) some predictive biomarkers of the residual hearing loss using modern proteomics and immunological techniques. A parallel search for blood biomarkers of post-implantation residual hearing loss and for molecular and cellular evidences of immune response to cochlear implantation will be performed.  The study will recruit 50 subjects-candidates for cochlear implantation surgery; 30 normally hearing individuals eligible for other types of otological interventions will form a control group. For all the participants blood samples will be collected and preserved. In addition, the perilymph sampling will be performed during cochlear implantation surgery.  This project relies on the calculation that from 50 patients post-cochlear implantation, 15 patients will form a group with maintained residual hearing and 15 will display delayed hearing loss. For these 30 subjects together with the control group the blood biomarkers search will be performed.  For the group of implanted patients, the follow-up will last for 12 months with 6 visits in total :  * the inclusion visit V0 during which the study will be presented and the consent form will be signed * the surgery visit V1 with blood sample and perilymph collection * the activation visit V2, 1 month ± 1 week after V1, visit V3 3 months ± 7 days after V1, V4 6 months ± 7 days after V1, V5 12 months ± 1 month after V1. During each of this visit blood sampling will be performed.  For the control group, the follow up will be 6 months long with 4 visits in total arranged during the routine follow-up appointments:  * the inclusion visit V0 during which the study will be presented and the consent form will be signed * the surgery visit V1, the 1 month visit V2 and the 6 months visit V3 during which the blood sampling will be performed.

Evaluation of BOTOX® With Rehabilitation Therapy for the Treatment of Wrist and Hand Spasticity in Post-Stroke Patients The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of BOTOX® in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline (which would do nothing) when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active function tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common spasticity patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent wrist, thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at Emory University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug will know if they are getting BOTOX® or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives will be completely randomized (like flipping a coin). All subjects will have rehabilitation therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits (qualification (Week 1), Injection (Week 2), Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All subjects will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a day, 3-5 times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data on the ability of BOTOX® and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to spastic muscles of the arm and hand after stroke. This project has the potential to increase the availability of effective rehabilitation techniques to patients with stroke.

Low-Dose Cytarabine in Treating Infants With Down Syndrome and Transient Myeloproliferative Disorder RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of abnormal cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving low-doses of cytarabine may be an effective treatment for Down syndrome and transient myeloproliferative disorder. Sometimes the disease may not need treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.  PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying low-dose cytarabine to see how well it works in treating infants with Down syndrome and transient myeloproliferative disorder.
Study of Oral Uremic Toxin Absorbent and Probiotics to Retard the Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), uremic toxins accumulate when kidney function declines. Those uremic toxins had a greater affinity to circulating proteins are called "protein bound uremic toxins, PBUT." Apart from traditional small or middle molecule uremic toxins, the PBUTs can be rarely eliminated using traditional renal replacement therapy, even using high flux dialysis modalities. Among these molecules identified, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and p-cresol (PC) are mostly studied. Both in vitro and in vivo study, IS and PC are associated with endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and increased risk for CV outcomes.  The uremic toxins (IS and PC) are originated in the endogenous environment, mainly from the protein metabolism, food intake, or produced by gut microbiota. Prevention of IS or PC precursors from being absorbed across the intestinal tract has been extensively studied in the renal literature by use of oral adsorbents. In animal models, activated charcoal reduces the serum concentration of creatinine (cre) and may delay CKD progression by alleviating IS overload. An oral form of non-absorbable surface-modified activated bamboo charcoal (ABC), has been demonstrated to effectively reduce circulating and renal IS levels in animal models.  Recently, probiotics, prebiotics or synbiotics have been reported to reduce inflammation, improve kidney function and retard progression of CKD by restoring the symbiosis of gut microflora in patients with CKD. A randomized trial found synbiotics decreased serum PCS without reducing serum IS in non-dialysis CKD. Another study found that synbiotics delayed CKD progression. A systematic review found prebiotic and probiotic therapies reduced IS and PCS in patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) on haemodialysis. However, it is unclear whether the results hold true for other patients with CKD. Based on these previous findings, investigators will conduct a prospective randomized open blinded end-point (PROBE) study to see if oral uremic toxin absorbent + probiotics prevent CKD progression. Also, a panel of clinical and biochemical profiles will be checked to investigate possible link between several biomarkers and clinical response.

Detection of Pleural Effusion by Internal Thoracic Impedance Method Early detection of pleural effusion (PLE) would improve the treatment. However, preclinical detection of pleural effusion is often not possible.  Radiographic examination, widely used for detecting pleural effusion ,is not suitable for prolonged monitoring of patients at high risk of developing PLE especially ambulatory or at home The currently available methods for monitoring and early detection such as the measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or measurement by double indicator thermodilution, are not reliable enough and may themselves lead to complications.  Measuring internal thoracic impedance (ITI), the main component of which is lung impedance, is a noninvasive and safe method. PLE will be diagnosed in accordance with well-accepted clinical signs(dyspnea, cyanosis, pulmonary rales, crepitations, arterial hypoxemia) and roentgenological criteria
A Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of HSK7653 in Subjects With Renal Impairment This is an open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of HSK7653 in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and subjects with kidney failure compared to the matched control subjects with normal renal function.

Provitamin A Absorption and Conversion With Avocados Vitamin A is necessary in the human diet. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is not "active" and must be converted to the active form in the human body. However, information on the ability of humans to absorb and convert vitamin A to the active form is still lacking. In this study, the investigators will observe the absorption and conversion of vitamin A from orange tomato sauce and/or carrots after a meal with fat (from avocado fruit) and a meal without fat. The investigators will also test whether eating these foods might protect the blood against damage that could lead to heart disease.
Parasternal Subpectoral Plane Blocks for Cardiac Surgery Via a Midline Sternotomy To better determine whether parasternal subpectoral plane blocks (PSPB) infusing bupivacaine for midline sternotomy decreases opioid consumption and pain scores.  This is a prospective, blinded randomized controlled trial with 2 arms. 1 arm is the saline control arm, PSPB catheters will be placed with saline and continue to infuse saline. The other arm is bupivacaine study arm, PSPB catheters will be placed with bupivacaine and continue to infuse the local anesthetic.
High-dose Antioxidants for Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is the serous neurosensory detachment that usually involves the macular area. It is common in patients between 30-50 years old and effects male more often than female with the ratio of 5-10. The common risk factors are psychologic stress, type A personality, systemic steroid use, hypertension and pregnancy. The treatment is usually observation especially in the first three-months. The laser or photodynamic therapy should be considered when the condition does not improve after that time. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of CSC is still not well understood but the study from indocyanine green angiography showed the choroidal vascular hyperpermeability and abnormal leakage. The causes of this abnormality are supposed to be from nitric oxide, prostaglandins or even free oxidative radicals. From this hypothesis, the oxidative process might be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease especially in the early stage. This study is to determine the effect of antioxidants drugs in the acute stage of CSC and to determine whether they can improve the outcomes of the disease.
FOcus on Reducing Dose-limiting Toxicities in Colon Cancer With Resistance Exercise Study FORCE is a randomized home-based resistance training/strength training (RT) intervention study for Stage II and III colon cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Participants will be 180 newly diagnosed Stage II and III colon cancer patients from Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC), the Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI), and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The intervention will begin within the first weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy and continue exercise through the completion of post-operative chemotherapy. Specifically, the investigators will examine between group differences for RT versus waitlist control for chemotherapy outcomes including dose delays, dose reductions, early stoppage and Grade 3 and 4 toxicities. The investigators will also study changes in muscle mass (MM) and changes in specific inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, IL-6 and TNF-RII) as potential markers of change in response to RT. To determine effects of change of MM on chemotherapy-specific drug clearance, the investigators will examine the impact body composition changes on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 5-FU and oxaliplatin, two of the most commonly used drugs for colon cancer.

An Integrated Self-Management Intervention for Adolescents With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder, affecting 7%-18% of reproductive-age women. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for a number of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Often diagnosed during the challenging developmental period of adolescence (ages 14-18), current clinical practice guidelines fail to consider the life-long nature of effective PCOS self-management through sustained healthy lifestyle habits and may, in fact, contribute to maladaptive patterns of unsustainable strategies for weight loss in adolescents. The investigators are testing an integrated mindfulness-based healthy lifestyle intervention for adolescents with PCOS (Working to Optimize Wellness in Teens with PCOS \[WOW\]). The purpose of this study is to obtain data supporting preliminary efficacy of WOW on biological and mental health outcomes with adolescents diagnosed with PCOS.
The Use of Dexmedetomidine for EEG Sedation in Children With Behavioural Disorders Children's compliance during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures is a challenge, often requiring the use of sedative and/or analgesic drugs.  Electroencephalogram (EEG) needs stillness for a medium-long period but, at the same time, the use of any drug for sedation may affect the exam through an interference with EEG waves. Dexmedetomidine is a selective ∝2-adrenergic agonist with sedative and anxiolytic properties, with a long effect and which does not alter EEG pattern.  The aim of this interventional study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of dexmedetomidine for sedation during EEG in children who are not cooperative.  Children affected by behavioral disorders and requiring sedation to perform EEG were considered. The protocol establishes to administer IV dexmedetomidine (loading dose and continued infusion) to reach a targeted level of sedation (Pediatric Sedation State Scale = 2). Vital signs (SatO2, RR, EtCO2, HR, BP) and level of sedation are recorded before, during and after procedure until the offset.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer This protocol is a single arm phase II multi-center trial evaluating the efficacy of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with response or stable disease after 4 cycles of first-line chemotherapy. The core hypothesis tested is that SBRT after 4 cycles of first-line chemotherapy is feasible, safe, provides durable local control of treated lesions and improves time to progression compared to historical controls. Patients are eligible for enrollment if they have metastatic NSCLC with ≤5 lesions amenable to SBRT.
Portable Health Files Improve Quality of Care and Health Outcomes: a Randomized Controlled Trial The PHF trial will assess the acceptability and long term outcomes resulting from the usage of electronic (carried by the patient on a USB memory device) and paper portable health files in a population with high intensity use of medical services. The rationale is that use of the portable health files provides a conduit of direct communication among health care providers of a patient's important health care information and this leads to better care and patient outcomes.  Primary hypothesis: Addition of a patient-held portable health file (PHF) to usual care improves patient outcome and quality-of-life compared to usual care alone.  Secondary hypothesis: Addition of patient-held portable health file (PHF) to usual care is acceptable and satisfactory to patients and their health care providers.
Effects of Oral Antioxidant Cocktail in Cardiovascular Disease Patients Title: Effects of oral antioxidant cocktail on vascular function and muscle function in cardiovascular disease patients  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) generally refers to various conditions involving narrowed or blocked dysfunctional blood vessels that often lead to heart attack or stroke. One of the main contributors to blood vessel dysfunction is damage to the vascular endothelium. This often results from the accumulation of oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation due to a decrease in blood flow and oxygen transport to the body's organs and skeletal muscle.  The body's natural antioxidant defense system cannot keep up with the high level of OS clearance necessary to maintain proper vascular homeostasis. Previous research has addressed the use of single antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid) in CVD patients, but the use of a combination of antioxidants has yet to be examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of acute oral antioxidant cocktail administration (containing vitamin C, E, and alpha-lipoic acid) on oxidative stress, vascular function, autonomic function (heart rate variability), leg blood flow, leg muscle tissue oxygenation, and walking capacity in CVD patients.  This is a parallel study design that will assess the effects of oral antioxidant cocktail administration on CVD patients ages 50-85. Subjects will be required to visit the lab 1 time. This visit will consist of 1) obtaining informed consent and questions, 2) baseline blood sampling and baseline measurements of endothelial function, arterial stiffness, autonomic function (heart rate variability), leg blood flow, leg muscle oxygenation, and a walking test, 3) first dose oral antioxidant cocktail administration followed by a 2-hour break, 4) second dose oral antioxidant cocktail 30 minutes after the first dose, 5) post-consumption blood sampling and measurements of endothelial function, arterial stiffness, autonomic function (heart rate variability), leg blood flow, leg muscle oxygenation, and a walking test.

A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Multicomponent Walking Aid Program for People With MS This is a randomized controlled trial of the Assistive Device Selection, Training, and Education Program (ADSTEP). ADSTEP is a training program of six weekly one-on-one sessions with a physical therapist intended to reduce falls among people who use a hand-held walking aid, such as a cane or a walker. ADSTEP focuses on training in the use of the walking aid, and includes gait evaluation, walking aid selection and fitting, and progressive task-oriented training with the walking aid.  Participants will be randomized to receive ADSTEP or a waitlist control intervention; those in the control condition will receive National MS Society brochures on fall prevention and walking aid selection, and a letter will be sent informing their care provider that the subject reports falling. All subjects will complete an assessment visit at baseline, and follow-up assessments at about 8 weeks and about 6 months after that. Subjects will complete paper questionnaires of patient reported outcomes (PROs), a modified Functional Gait Assessment / Dynamic Gait Index, and will track fall sustained over their participation in the study using monthly paper fall calendars. At the end of study participation, all subjects in the control group will be offered the opportunity to receive ADSTEP.
Community Assets Supporting Transitions (CAST) The aim of this study is to test a support program for older adults with symptoms of depression and other chronic health problems after they are discharged home from hospital. The study will be conducted in three communities in Ontario (Sudbury, Burlington, and Hamilton) and the program will be implemented with input from community members. The program will be delivered by a Registered Nurse, who will provide support to patients via home visits and telephone calls. The nurse's role will involve linking patients and their caregivers with needed services and supports, reviewing medications that the patients are taking, assessing patients' health, building the skills of patients in problem-solving and managing their care, and providing education to patients and their caregivers.
Investigation of the Changes of Brain Structure and Function in Premature Ejaculation Patients and the Effects of Dapoxetine on Central Neural Activity in Premature Ejaculation Patients Lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE) is a common male sexual dysfunction with a high prevalence in global. Up to now, the etiology of LPE remains unclear. In recent years, dapoxetine, a highly potent serotonin-transporter inhibitor, has been used for treating premature ejaculation. However, the underlying mechanism of dapoxetine was unknown. Recently, with widespread use of neuroimaging techniques, like positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in basic science, researchers can acquire human data on cerebral base of human sexual behavior, not only in normal subjects but also in patients with sexual dysfunction. Therefore, in order to further understand the biological mechanism of LPE and the brain targets of dapoxetine, the present study would investigate the brain changes of LPE and the effect of dapoxetine on brain activation by using MRI technology.
High Cessation Rates in Smokers Using Personal Vaporizers E-cigarettes are proving to be an attractive long-term alternative to conventional cigarettes. Although they may also help smokers to remain abstinent during their quit attempt, recent clinical trials with first generation e-cigarettes have shown only modest quit rates. Second generation devices may result in much higher quit rates. Their efficacy and safety in long-term smoking cessation and/or smoking reduction studies have never been investigated.  In this prospective proof-of-concept study we monitored modifications in smoking habits of 50 regular smokers (unwilling to quit) who were asked to switch to a second generation device focusing on smoking reduction and smoking abstinence. Study participants were invited to attend a total of five study visits: at baseline, week-4, week-8, week-12 and week-24. Product usage, number of cigarettes smoked, and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels were measured at each visit. Smoking reduction and abstinence rates were calculated. Adverse events and participants' opinions of these products were also reviewed.
Evaluation and Treatment of Oral Soft Tissue Diseases This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with diseases of the mouth or systemic diseases that involve the mouth. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive current standard of care treatments. The purposes of the study are: 1) to allow NIDCR's Gene Therapy and Therapeutics Branch staff to gain more knowledge about oral soft tissue diseases and possibly identify new avenues of research in this area; and 2) to establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be voluntary.)  Patients of any age with oral diseases or systemic diseases involving the mouth may be eligible for this study. Women of childbearing potential and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding will only have tests and procedures and receive medications that pose no greater than a minimal risk to the fetus.  Participants will have a comprehensive dental and medical examination, including a physical examination of the head and neck. Additional tests and procedures that may be required for diagnosis and to guide treatment include the following:  * Blood and urine tests - for routine laboratory studies, assessment of kidney and liver function, and detection of viruses, fungi, bacteria or parasites * Electrocardiogram - to record the electrical activity of the heart * Biopsies - to examine tissue under the microscope. The method and number of biopsies depends on the individual's specific condition and the tissue to be removed. For all biopsies a local anesthetic (lidocaine with or without epinephrine) is injected at the biopsy site. A punch biopsy uses a small sharp cookie-cutter instrument to remove a small (about 1/10- to 1/5-inch) piece of skin. An excisional biopsy uses a small surgical knife or scalpel to remove a piece of tissue, usually requiring some stitches to close the wound. * Diagnostic imaging - X-rays, photographs, or other tests as needed for diagnosis  Treatments include tablets, injections and topically applied medications. All preparations are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are commercially available. Patient follow-up may vary from one visit to intermittent visits over a number of years, depending on the patient's condition.
Comparison of Oral Chloral Hydrate and Combination of Intranasal Dexmedetomidine and Ketamine for Procedural Sedation in Children In Korea, oral chloral hydrate is still widely used for pediatric procedural sedation. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine (2mcg/kg) and ketamine (3mg/kg) on the first-attempt success rate of pediatric procedural sedation. The hypothesis of this study is that the intranasal dexmedetomidine (2mcg/kg) and ketamine (3mg/kg) will improve the success rate of adequate pediatric procedural sedation (PSSS=1,2,3) within 15 minutes. This is a prospective, parallel-arm, single-blinded, multi-center, randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of intranasal dexmedetomidine (2mcg/kg) and ketamine (3mg/kg) with oral chloral hydrate (50mg/kg) in pediatric patients undergoing procedural sedation. Prior to the procedure, each patient will be randomized in the control arm (oral chloral hydrate) or study arm (intranasal dexmedetomidine and ketamine).

Erythromycin Versus Azithromycin in Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) is treated with an antibiotic, erythromycin or azithromycin, to prolong pregnancy. Erythromycin is taken for several days and can result in stomach upset in some patients, causing them to stop taking the medication. Therefore, azithromycin is often prescribed instead. Azithromycin is usually taken only once and stomach upset is not seen or greatly reduced. The goal of this study is to see if there is a difference between the antibiotic (azithromycin) compared to the antibiotic (erythromycin) in prolonging pregnancy in patients with Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM). The working hypothesis is that there is no difference in the clinical effectiveness between antibiotic regimens containing the macrolides azithromycin and erythromycin for prolonging latency in PPROM.
Time Restricted Eating During Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the United States however, little is known about how diet can affect cancer treatment. Pre-clinical murine studies report intermittent fasting increases effectiveness of chemotherapy and decreases treatment related adverse events. The proposed research will demonstrate that time restricted eating, a form of intermittent fasting, will improve treatment related outcomes, patient related outcomes, and limit treatment related weight gain and fat mass accretion.Time restricted eating combined with a mediterranean diet will also be feasible and improve cardiometabolic risk more than TRE alone or standard care.

Common Genetic Variation and Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a common metabolic disorder arising from a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and the environment. The development of this disorder is preceded by impaired glucose tolerance and elevated fasting glucose which also carry adverse cardiovascular risk. To date a few common genetic variants have been reliably associated with predisposition to type 2 diabetes. However, it is uncertain how these genes interact to alter insulin secretion and insulin action prior to the development of type 2 diabetes. We propose to utilize an established population-based cohort to determine how common genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes alter the response to an oral glucose challenge in people without overt type 2 diabetes. This will enable us to understand how common variants alone or in combination alter whole-body glucose physiology and predispose to type 2 diabetes.

Impact of a Patient-Centered Program for Low Anterior Resection Syndrome A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial After undergoing restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer, many patients are left with significant bowel dysfunction, known as Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS). Increased LARS severity correlates with worse perceived global health status and quality of life (QoL). Among patients undergoing rectal resection with a permanent ostomy, there is evidence that supportive and educational interventions improve QoL, ostomy proficiency, self-efficacy and knowledge. However, evidence regarding the impact of such interventions in patients who undergo restorative proctectomy is lacking, despite the latter operation being far more frequently performed.  The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the extent to which a LARS Patient-Centered Program impacts on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) after restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer.  This is a randomized-controlled muticenter trial that will include patients who have undergone restorative proctectomy for neoplastic disease (benign or malignant) located in the rectum (0-15cm from the anal verge) with a diverting ostomy and who are scheduled for ostomy closure.
Follicle Size and Oocyte Development Studies have shown that the follicles greater in diameter was most likely to have a mature oocyte that was capable of fertilization and best suited for development into a high-quality embryo. Smaller follicles showed lower rates ( 60%).  Lately new triggering protocols have emerged aiming to improve the proportion of mature oocytes at the time of retrieval. The aim of this study is to learn the effects of the dual triggering compared to the standard hCG triggering on the oocyte development and quality as a function of the follicle size

Telehealth for Diabetes Self-Management This study will examine the feasibility and short and-long-term efficacy of a web-based telehealth intervention with community-dwelling older adults who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Effectiveness will be evaluated using multiple measures within three different domains: 1) physical (glycosylated hemoglobin \[HbA1C\], weight, and lipid levels); 2) behavioral (monitoring blood glucose levels, feet inspections, diet, and exercise frequency), and 3) psychosocial (depression, quality of life, social support, and adjustment to diabetes).  This is a randomized controlled trial of a web-based telehealth intervention designed to improve self-management behaviors in a group of community dwelling older diabetics. Two groups of participants will be recruited and randomized over a four-month period during years 01 and 02. Participants in the control group will receive standard diabetic care provided by their provider. Participants in the intervention group will receive computer training in the participant's home in how to access and utilize the web-based telehealth study webpage. The intervention will consist of a program designed and delivered via the Internet to improve the participants' diabetes self-management behaviors using behavioral and motivational strategies and cues to modify perceptions of self-efficacy and beliefs regarding the ability to affect the progress of the disease and change personal behavior.

An Randomized Double Blind Controlled Trial of niPGT-A in Women With RPL Objectives: To compare the efficacy in embryo selection based on morphology alone compared to morphology and non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (niPGT-A) in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF).  Hypothesis to be tested: The embryo selection based on morphology and niPGT-A results in a lower miscarriage rate and a higher live birth rate in IVF as compared with that based on morphology alone.  Design and subjects: Randomized double-blind randomized controlled trial. Women with RPL undergoing IVF will be enrolled.  Interventions: Spent culture medium (SCM) of each blastocyst will be frozen individually. They will be randomly allocated into two groups: (1) the intervention group based on morphology and niPGT-A and (2) the control group based on morphology alone.  In the control group, blastocysts with the best quality morphology will be replaced first. In the intervention group, blastocysts with the best morphology and euploid result of SCM will be replaced first.  Main outcome measures: The primary outcome is the miscarriage rate per the first embryo transfer.  Data analysis: Comparison of quantitative variables will be performed using Student's t, while categorical variables will be compared using a Chi-square analysis. All statistical analyses will be performed with the intention to treat and per protocol, and a p-value \<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  Expected outcome results: The embryo selection based on morphology and niPGT-A results in a lower miscarriage rate and a higher live birth rate in IVF as compared with the control group based on morphology alone.

A Controlled Trial on Recreational Runners With Patellofemoral Pain From a rehabilitation point of view, while several approaches exist to retrain runners with PFPS, it is not clear which one is most effective, or why. The goals of this randomised-controlled trial are: 1) to compare the effectiveness of three rehabilitation programs on pain and functional limitations of runners with PFPS and 2) to explain why the programs are effective or not based on laboratory analyses. After baseline evaluation, runners will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, each with a specific 8-week rehabilitation program aimed at addressing the efficiency of a specific type of retraining. These groups are: 1) Control; 2) muscle recruitment; 3) reducing knee loading during running.  The investigators hypothesis is that the intervention targeting a reduction in knee loading will be significantly more effective in reducing symptoms and improving function of runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Tissue-specific Insulin Resistance in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Role of Hypoxia Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition associated with significant adverse health outcomes. Our overarching hypothesis is that patients with OSA and hypoxia (H-OSA) have greater degrees of insulin resistance in both liver and adipose tissue when compared to those without hypoxia (NH-OSA) thus leading to increased risk for the development of diabetes in the former group.
Analyse Cardio-respiratory Patterns in Order to Early Detect the Clinical Complications in the Hemodialysis Patients The incidence and prevalence of dialysis in Taiwan remains higher as compared to past several years. The number of dialysis reported about 6-7 million people each year and the 2014 full-year cost estimation was about 330 million NTDs. According to age-standardized population statistics in 1995, the number of dialysis per million population in 2006 year were 372.2 people, 381.9 people in 2012 year and the annual growth rate of 0.43 percent recorded.  EarlySense system is certified by TFDA, FDA and many other countries, which consists of mainly two parts. One for the sensing element, which placed under the mattress and the other one is AC-powered display panel bed. This system has the ability to monitor the patients physiological functions just be in contact via bed. When the patient laid on bed, the sensor which is placed under the bed would detects heart rate, breathing rate and activity level as well as other physiological signals. The system is also able to distinguish between patients in bed and out of bed during the operation to save the patient's records and information (including heart rate, respiratory rate and level of activity, and may render trends). The system is also have capability for real-time data transmission information which includes a warning to the nurses' station or other monitoring center of the screen by providing real-time information to nurse.  In this research project, we will use EarlySense equipment for continuous monitoring the dialysis patient's physiological data along with clinical data such as A. acute complications such as rapid changes in blood pressure, respiratory rate, movements of patients and Nausea or vomiting, etc phenomenon's) B. Lab examination data C. Status of patient whether patients hospitalized or not and patient death occurred or not. The study is expected to have a pilot study for more than three months' duration. Through this EarlySense continuous monitoring and gather the data, we will analyse to develop a prediction model and confirmed with indicators. Evidences from these analytics would help to propose ways to improve it and implement Positive predictive validity models.

Randomized Controlled Trial of Enhanced Pharmacy Care in Older Veteran Outpatients Complications resulting from medications, or adverse drug events (ADEs), are prevalent and are a major source of excess morbidity and costs. ADEs are particularly problematic in older patients because of their higher burden of comorbidity and diminished physiologic reserve. In addition, older patients are more likely to be exposed to polypharmacy, a major risk factor for ADEs. While ADEs may be idiosyncratic, many result from medical errors and inadequate systems for ensuring the safe and effective use of medications.  The goal of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a potentially potent intervention to improve the use of medications in older outpatients enrolled in VA primary care clinics. The intervention-Enhanced Pharmacy Care-involves a formal, multi-dimensional evaluation of patients� medication regimens by a trained clinical pharmacist and board-certified geriatrician.
N-Acetylcysteine and Arginine Administration in Diabetic Patients It has been demonstrated that the nitric oxide production is reduced in type 2 diabetic patients and that cardiovascular complications represent 80% of the causes of death in these patients. As nitric oxide is able to reduce platelet aggregation, increase the relaxation of smooth muscle cells, and reduce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and endothelin, we hypothesized that nitric oxide deficiency is responsable for the cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Arginine and N-acetylcysteine, precursor and enhancer of the nitric oxide synthesis respectively, are able to increase nitric oxide production.  Aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of arginine and N-acetylcysteine administration on arterial blood pressure and different metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  Subjects and methods. 24 male subjects, randomly divided in two groups, will be studied. These subjects will undergo a treatment with arginine (1200 mg once a day) plus N-acetylcysteine (600 mg twice a day) or placebo for six months. Basal and final evaluations include:  * general examination * ABPM (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) * HbA1c, total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, oxidized LDLs, triglycerides, reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio in red blood cells, nitrites/nitrates, asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethyl-arginine, nitrotyrosine, arginine, homocysteine, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, intercellular and vascular-cell adhesion molecules, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and fibrinogen * the ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness after endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery  Expected results. Increase of nitric oxide production and reduction of arterial blood pressure and oxidative parameters.

Pilot Study of Mothers and Babies Online in Home Visiting The investigators propose a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that examines how the redesigned version of Mothers and Babies Online (eMB) can be delivered in the context of home visiting (HV) programs that serve pregnant individuals and new mothers across the United States. The PI, Dr. Darius Tandon (Northwestern University), has conducted extensive research on the in-person Mothers and Babies (MB) intervention with HV programs and has received interest from one of the largest HV models-Parents as Teachers (PAT)-to explore the use of eMB with pregnant individuals that they serve.
COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake in Belgium : Sociodemographic and Socioeconomic Disparities In January 2021, the vaccination campaign against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Belgium. The vaccination campaign was conducted in several phases, with the first phase targeting priority groups starting in January 2021. The second phase began in June 2021 with the invitation of everyone aged 18 years and older before extending access to 12 years and older from summer 2021. Children aged 5-11 were also invited for vaccination from December 2021 onwards.  The presence of a social gradient in COVID-19 infections and subsequent outcomes has been clearly demonstrated. Individuals from lower socioeconomic groups, for example with lower income, lower education level or unemployed are more likely to be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 and to develop severe complications after the infection such as hospitalization, ICU admission or death. Certain sociodemographic characteristics such as male gender, older age, living in crowded households, or belonging to ethnic/racial minorities are also associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes. In addition to disparities in infection, hospitalization and mortality, some studies have also documented a lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage among people from disadvantaged socioeconomic groups during COVID-19 pandemic.  Despite widespread vaccine promotion efforts and the fact that Belgium has the 7th highest full vaccine coverage in the European Union (89% of people over 18 years old had completed their primary course of vaccination on 08 April 2022), concerns regarding vaccine equity remain. Vaccine uptake depends on a range of factors, including the socio-cultural environment, pre-existing health needs and individual choice. Identifying differences in vaccination between population groups is crucial to assess the effectiveness of the vaccination strategy in Belgium and its relationship to the further spread of COVID-19.  The objective is to identify whether vaccination coverage has been equitable across Belgium and, if not, which groups of individuals are less likely to be covered by the COVID-19 vaccine, with respect to their sociodemographic (SD) and socioeconomic (SE) characteristics.  This study therefore aims to highlight SD and SE disparities in the uptake of the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Belgium among people of 18 years and over.

The Impact of Surgical Technique on PDC Permanent canines in the maxilla usually erupt into the mouth at 11-12 years of age. In approximately 2% of the Swedish population they fail to erupt, and are then referred to as impacted. One severe complication of impacted maxillary canines is damage (root resorption) to the roots of adjacent teeth. The root resorption may be so severe that neighboring teeth are lost. If the impaction is detected early (at 9-10 years of age), the recommended treatment is to extract the deciduous canine, to help the permanent canine to resolve its unfavorable position. If there is no improvement of the position of the canine 1 year after the extraction, surgical and orthodontic treatment is indicated. Surgical exposure is followed by orthodontic treatment with fixed appliance for 2 to 3 years to bring the canine into correct position.  Two different main principles of surgical exposure in palatally impacted maxillary permanent canines are the so called closed versus open surgical techniques.  Closed technique involves surgically uncovering of the canine with a mucoperiosteal flap dissected off the bone. The bone covering the canine is being removed and an attachment with a chain is bonded to the tooth. The flap is repositioned and sutured back with the chain above the mucosa. Shortly after the surgery, orthodontic force is applied via the chain. The canine is orthodontically moved beneath the palatal mucosa by forced eruption.  Open technique involves surgically uncovering of the canine, removing a window of tissue around it and placing pack to cover the exposed area. Then the treatment approaches vary depending on whether the attachment with a chain is bonded to the exposed tooth at surgery or if spontaneous eruption of the palatally impacted canine is expected postsurgically. In both alternatives orthodontic force is applied via the chain and the canine is orthodontically moved above the mucosa. These two techniques of surgical exposure of palatally impacted canines seem to be the two routinely used in Sweden.  The purposes of this study are to examine, describe and compare the treatment outcomes in regard to success and duration of treatment, complications, side effects, cost-benefit aspects and patients´ perceptions in closed versus open surgical exposure techniques, in cases with palatally impacted canines.  The objective is to test the null hypothesis that there are no differences in the above outcomes between open or closed surgical exposure of palatally impacted canines.
In Vitro Optimization of Oxytocin-induced Myometrial Contractility by Propranolol The rates of cesarean deliveries (CD) and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are on the rise, with failed induction and augmentation of labor as major contributing factors. Oxytocin is commonly used for labor induction, as well as during the third stage of labor to minimize the risk of primary PPH. At delivery, it is imperative that the uterus responds effectively to parenteral oxytocin. Poor response to oxytocin following delivery is commonly due to prolonged labor with oxytocin augmentation that is known to "desensitize" the myometrium. Despite the option of several second line uterotonic agents, none of them are as effective as oxytocin in controlling PPH. Given that poor uterine muscle contraction is the root cause of both failed induction or augmentation (leading to a CD in labor) and uterine atony (leading to PPH), there is an urgent and clinically important need to investigate novel methods to enhance oxytocin-induced myometrial contractions.  Propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor agonist, has the potential to improve myometrial contractions by virtue of its ability to inhibit catecholamine production. The investigators plan to investigate the effects of propranolol in both naive and desensitized myometrium, in order to better understand its potential role in improving labor induction and reducing the risk of PPH following oxytocin exposure during labor.  The investigators hypothesize that propranolol is likely to potentiate the action of oxytocin upon human myometrium, to ultimately help improve the success of labor induction/augmentation and treatment of PPH.
A Study of Rituximab (MabThera®/Rituxan®) in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis and Inadequate Response to Methotrexate This 3 arm study assessed the efficacy of rituximab (MabThera®/Rituxan®) in the prevention of progression of structural joint damage in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to methotrexate.

Prospective Validation of the CoDE-HF Algorithm for the Diagnosis of Acute Heart Failure Acute heart failure is a life-threatening condition where the heart is suddenly unable to pump blood around the body. It can be challenging to diagnose because the symptoms often mimic other conditions. Previous studies have showed that delays in making the correct diagnosis result in worse outcomes. We therefore developed a decision-support tool called CoDE-HF that uses a computer algorithm to combine levels of a blood test called NT-proBNP with patient factors to calculate the probability of acute heart failure for an individual.  In this project, we wish to evaluate the performance of CoDE-HF in approximately 2,000 patients attending the Emergency Department with suspected acute heart failure. We will store surplus material from their blood tests to measure NT-proBNP and link information from their electronic health records with other routinely collected medical information in regional and national databases in order to evaluate this algorithm.

Comparative Study of Non-Invasive Mask Ventilation vs Cuirass Ventilation in Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure. Non-invasive ventilation has become increasingly important in the management of patients with acute respiratory failure. One of its major goals is to prevent the need for invasive ventilation, which is associated with numerous complications. This study compares the usefulness and safety of two noninvasive techniques which are used in Medical practice: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation using a face mask and extrathoracic biphasic ventilation using a cuirass. Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages and both may not suit all patients. It is therefore important to compare the two in terms of effectiveness in preventing invasive ventilation and their side effects profile, so that we can improve our understanding and expertise in the treatment of patients in respiratory failure.

Maturation of arteriovenous fistula will be evaluated at 8 weeks after surgery by duplex in all patients.
A Study Using the LMC Diabetes Registry to Learn More About Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Canadian Patients With Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) In people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin or does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels.  People with T2D are at a higher risk of having a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, the kidneys become damaged and do not work as they should. People with CKD can have trouble breathing and often have swelling in their arms and legs, and high blood pressure.  People who have CKD and T2D are more likely to have other medical problems, such as heart disease.  There are many treatments available to patients who have CKD and T2D. But, researchers need more information about how doctors in Canada are deciding which treatment to give these patients.  In this study, the researchers will review health information from men and women with T2D who visited a doctor in 2019 and had check-ups for at least 6 months. The health information will be taken from a Canadian registry (or database) owned by LMC Diabetes \& Endocrinology. The registry contains information from people that went to an LMC clinic. In this study, the researchers will learn how many of these people had T2D and CKD. They will learn the treatments these people received, and if they had other related medical problems. The researchers will also use surveys to ask the doctors about why they chose certain treatments.

Diagnostic Contribution of Ultrasonography in Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It is an important health problem that has been increasingly encountered in recent years. With advances in treatment, the survival time after breast cancer is prolonged, and as a result, many women face certain diseases during this period. One of these diseases, breast cancer-related lymphedema, is characterized by abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial tissue, which can occur at any time after breast cancer surgery or radiotherapy and is a major cause of morbidity.Early and accurate diagnosis of lymphedema is very important for effective treatment. In routine clinical practice there are various methods used to diagnose lymphedema such as history, physical examination and limb circumference. Circumferential measurement is based on the principle of circumference measurement at certain intervals (such as 4 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm) from certain anatomical reference points on the extremities. Volume calculation can also be made from a data obtained from circumferential measurements via a computer program. Circumferential and volume measurements are used in the diagnosis, severity of lymphedema and follow-up of treatment. Although it is the most commonly used method in practice, circumferential measurements and volume measurements alone can ignore changes in tissue structure and significant changes in the presence of latent lymphedema. At the same time, circumferential measurements are made at regular intervals and the difference between the healthy side and 2 cm or more is considered as lymphedema, which may neglect tissue and edema changes in areas not in the measuring area. Ultrasonography, which has been used in the measurement and evaluation of lymphedema in recent years, is a noninvasive economic method. Skin and subcutaneous distance in lymphedema can be measured by ultrasonography, and changes in tissue structure, fibrous tissue, adipose tissue and muscle tissue can be demonstrated. Fibrotic changes in lymphedema tissue play a key role in progression. Subcutaneous ultrasound echogenicity (SEG), which is thought to be a measure of lymphedema severity in extremities, was determined as stages 0, 1 and 2. According to this; Stage 0: No increase in echogenicity in the subcutaneous layer. That is, the subcutaneous fat layer is observed as black. Stage 1: Diffuse increase in echogenicity, but identifiable horizontal or oblique-focused echogenic lines caused by bundles of connective tissue may be seen. In this study, the investigators aimed to determine the correlation between circumferential measurements and skin and subcutaneous tissue ultrasonography in breast cancer-related lymphedema patients.The primer aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between circumferential measurements and ultrasonographic measurements in breast cancer-related lymphedema. The secondary aim is to investigate the relationship among the changes in subcutaneous tissue structure (subcutaneous ultrasound echogenicity degree-SEG) and lymphedema severity in breast cancer-related lymphedema.
Preconception Intervention for Incarcerated Women With Substance Use The goal of this pilot trial is to test the feasibility and acceptability as well as efficacy of the adapted intervention, CHOICES-PLEAS (Pregnancy Liberated from Exposure to Alcohol and Substances) among women will illicit polysubstance use participating in a court-mandated jail-based 90-day substance use disorder treatment program. The main questions it aims to answer are:  1. What is the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the CHOICES-PLEAS intervention in a court-mandated jail-based substance use disorder treatment program? 2. Does participation in CHOICES-PLEAS lower the risk of a substance exposed pregnancy at 1 and 3 months after release compared to a control condition? 3. Does participation in CHOICES-PLEAS increase motivation to change substance use and reduce risky sexual behaviors at 1 and 3 months after release compared to a control condition? Participants will receive three one-on-one motivational interviewing sessions and one family planning referral visit during incarceration and one booster session at 1 month after release from jail.  Researchers will compare the CHOICES-PLEAS intervention to a control condition to see if participation in the intervention reduces risk of substance exposed pregnancy, increases motivation to change substance use, and reduces risk of risky sexual behaviors.
Bortezomib Followed by the Addition of Doxorubicin at Disease Progression in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced, Recurrent, or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (Cancer) of the Head and Neck This phase II trial is studying how well bortezomib followed by doxorubicin at the time of disease progression works in treating patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining bortezomib with doxorubicin may kill more tumor cells

MR-based Models for Clinically Significant Portal Hypertension in Cirrhosis (CHESS1802) Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is associated with an incremental risk of esophageal varices and overt clinical decompensations in cirrhosis. However, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement, the gold standard for defining CSPH (HVPG≥ 10mmHg) is invasive and therefore not suitable for routine clinical practice.  This is a multi-center diagnostic trial conducted at high-volume liver centres designed to determine the accuracy of MR-based models (investigational technology) for noninvasive detection of a CSPH in patients with cirrhosis. Transjugular HVPG measurement by means of catheterization of a hepatic vein with a balloon catheter is the gold-standard method to assess the presence of CSPH.

Evaluation of Safety, Reactogenicity and Immunogenicity of Fractional-dose Inactivated Polio Vaccine (fIPV) Given Intradermally With Double Mutant Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli Heat Labile Toxin (dmLT) Adjuvant Polio is a serious disease that can cause paralysis and death. It is caused by a virus and can be prevented by vaccine. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Polio Eradication Initiative is trying to get rid of all polio disease around the world. Researchers want to help by testing a new vaccine.  In many countries, people are vaccinated with oral polio vaccine (OPV) given by mouth during childhood. OPV is good at giving immunity (protection from polio) in the body and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Immunity in the GI tract is called mucosal immunity. The downsides of using OPV are that it can be shed into the environment in people's feces after vaccination where it can infect people who are not vaccinated, and it can cause paralysis in 2-4 of every one million children vaccinated with OPV. The United States (U.S.) stopped giving any OPV to people for vaccinations in the 1990's. Since then, a polio vaccine called inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is given as an injection for routine childhood immunizations in the U.S. You cannot get polio infection from IPV and it will not be shed into the environment.  In 2016, the WHO started a plan to help other countries gradually get rid of OPV. The downside of using IPV by itself is that, unlike OPV, it doesn't give enough mucosal immunity to protect people living in places where there is still polio. There are also supply shortages of IPV, which is a problem if there are outbreaks of polio. For the supply of IPV to help more people, it is safe and effective to use a tiny dose of IPV injected under the top layer of skin (intradermal or ID injection) rather than getting the full dose in the muscle. This is called a fractional dose of IPV, or fIPV.  To help stop using OPV globally, a better fIPV vaccine is needed. fIPV vaccine needs a substance to help stimulate a mucosal immune response. dmLT is a substance that has been shown to stimulate a mucosal immune response. It has been shown to be safe and effective in both humans and animals, both by itself and when given with other vaccines.  This study will test a mixture of fIPV-dmLT given intradermally (under the outer layer of the skin). This is the first study done in humans to give this combination intradermally. The IPV vaccine has already been approved by the FDA. The fIPV-dmLT vaccine has not been approved by the FDA.
Study in Healthy Volunteers of the Safety and Metabolism of Different Doses of the Anti-HIV Drug TMC278LA. TMC278 (also called rilpivirine) is a new drug being developed to treat HIV. Usually TMC278 is taken as a tablet, by mouth, once a day, but a 'long acting' formulation has been developed so the drug stays in the bloodstream for a longer time - this allows the drug to be given by injection and less often. It is hoped that this injectable version of the drug may be used to help prevent HIV transmission in the future by giving it to people who are at risk of HIV. This is similar to the way travellers to areas with malaria may take antibiotics to prevent infection. The investigators aim to investigate the feasibility of using TMC278 as a preventative medication by performing this study.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the levels of drug which can be measured in the blood, as well as the tissues and fluids of the rectum (the lowest part of the bowels just before the opening of the anus) as well as the safety of the drug and how well tolerated it is when given as a single dose. In this study, the investigators will not be investigating whether the drug prevents HIV so the investigators will recruit people who are HIV negative, and whose lifestyle does not put them at risk of becoming infected before or during the study.  If the study shows the drug is well tolerated and produces appropriate levels of the drug (in the bloodstream and the rectal compartment) to suggest that it could be effective, it will help design future studies looking at preventing HIV.

Early Metabolic Effects of Dolutegravir or Tenofovir Alefenamide in Healthy Volunteers Background:  People with HIV take drugs to keep the amount of virus in their body low. One type of these drugs, called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), can cause weight gain over time. Weight gain can cause diabetes, heart disease, and other serious issues. Researchers want to understand how INSTIs cause weight changes.  Objective:  To see how a common INSTI, dolutegravir (DTG), affects how the body uses energy. DTG will be compared with a non-INSTI drug, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).  Eligibility:  Healthy people aged 18 to 55.  Design:  Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will have a nutritional assessment and tests of their heart function.  Participants will have 2 inpatient stays at the clinic. Each stay will be for 11 nights, with a 3-week break between.  Both DTG and TAF are gel caps swallowed once per day by mouth. Participants will take 1 drug for 8 days during each stay.  Participants will have tests to see how their body uses energy:  They will spend 23 continuous hours in a special room that measures how much oxygen they breathe in and how much carbon dioxide they breathe out. They will do this a total of 6 times.  They will have a DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). DEXA is a kind of X-ray that measures body fat and bone density.  They will lie on a table. Electrodes will be placed on their hands and feet to measure body fat and lean body mass.  They will stand still on a platform for about 30 seconds. High-resolution laser cameras will scan their bodies.
Phase II Study of Dose-Dense Doxurubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) Followed By Paclitaxel With Trastuzumab in HER2/ NEU-Amplified Breast Cancer: Feasibility HER-2/neu (+) breast cancer is a more aggressive form of breast cancer. HER-2/neu is a protein that is overproduced by your tumor. It makes your cancer more aggressive. Standard treatments for this type of cancer will help some people, but there is a moderate to high chance that your cancer may come back.  The purpose of this study is to see if a new regimen will be effective in preventing cancer from coming back. This is a phase II trial. In this trial, patient get a drug regimen that has been tested in small groups of people to see what dose is safe. Researchers now wish to see how effective the drug is for HER-2/neu (+) breast cancer. The objective includes looking at short-term side effects and risks of the drug. All of the drugs on this regimen can affect the heart which can be a serious side effect. The drugs affect on heart function is a primary focus.
Use of an Algorithm to Determine IV Sedation Dosing During First-trimester Surgical Abortion This study aims to compare an algorithm for IV sedation dosing to the current standard of care in patients undergoing first trimester surgical abortion. The primary outcome is subjects' pain score with suction curettage on a 0-100 21-point scale. Secondary outcomes include pain scores with cervical dilation and 15 minutes post-procedure, subjective pain ratings, incidents of side effects and adverse events, the frequency of additional doses of medication, recovery room time, and physician assessment of and satisfaction with pain control. Investigators hypothesize that this algorithm will result in improved pain control, decreased frequency of additional medication doses, improved patient and physician satisfaction, without differences in side effects, adverse events or recovery room time.

Making Maternal Post-partum Vitamin A Supplementation Effective: The Role of Timing and Inflammation Background:  Vitamin A is of utmost importance for health and survival of children. A recent series in The Lancet on maternal and child health put vitamin A deficiency at the top of most important micronutrient deficiencies, responsible for more than 600.000 child deaths/year worldwide. Vitamin A status of mothers and infants is closely linked. Hence, a mother with vitamin A deficiency cannot give enough vitamin A to her fetus to build stores during the last months of pregnancy, and will also have insufficient amounts of vitamin A in her breast milk, resulting in a high risk for vitamin A deficiency in her newborn infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented several strategies to fight vitamin A deficiency in mothers and children. One of these is to give women after delivery a high dose vitamin A supplement, to improve vitamin A status of mother and, via breast milk, her infant. Surprisingly however, several recent studies investigating the effect of a high dose vitamin A supplement for mothers directly after birth found no effect on vitamin A status in infants 6 months of age. In contrast, earlier studies in Bangladesh and Indonesia, in which women received a high dose vitamin A supplement somewhere in the first 6 weeks after delivery, reported a large impact on vitamin A status in the infants at 6 mo of age. The WHO recommendation on post-partum vitamin A supplementation was based on these earlier studies from Bangladesh and Indonesia. The more recent studies suggest however that this intervention is not effective, and that millions of women currently receive a high dose vitamin A supplement without clear benefits for vitamin A status in either the women or their children.  The human body reacts to infection or injury with an inflammatory response, which kicks off with the acute phase response. The acute phase response helps the body to fight the infection. It is characterized by many altered physiological processes, including changed availability of vitamins and minerals. Recently, we found that delivery in itself causes a major acute phase response. We have formed the hypothesis that the acute phase response initiated by delivery prevents the high dose vitamin A supplement given to the mother directly after delivery from being absorbed and from being available for breast milk. If this is true, the current WHO recommendation to give the vitamin A within the first 6 weeks post-partum should be changed to giving the vitamin A 4 - 6 weeks post-partum instead, to allow the acute phase response induced by delivery to fade.  Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es):  The main objective is to improve the effectiveness of the current WHO policy of vitamin A supplementation after delivery to improve vitamin A status and health of mothers and their infants.  Methodology:  In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 400 women will receive a high dose of vitamin A (200.000 IU) within 6 weeks of delivery, as recommended by WHO. Half of the women will receive the vitamin A directly after delivery (within 3 days, current practice), whereas the other women will receive the vitamin A 6 weeks after delivery. To guarantee blinding, women will receive a placebo capsule if they are not receiving a vitamin A capsule.  Main outcomes will be maternal and infant vitamin A status 6 months post-partum and the time-course of the acute phase response, to establish the optimal time after delivery for the initiation of the vitamin A supplementation.  Secondary outcomes will be the morbidity of the infants during the first 6 months of life and growth performance of the infants at 6 mo of age.  Potential Impact:  The results of this study will enable WHO to improve the effectiveness of the current WHO recommendations concerning post-partum vitamin A supplementation. If our hypothesis is true, postponing the timing of the post-partum vitamin A supplement from directly after delivery to 6 week post-partum, will significantly increased the availability of the supplement for the mother. This will increase the vitamin A status of both mother and infant. Moreover, there are several significant implications for global health policies, with important consequences for infant survival worldwide by reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases during the first 6 months of life. Results of the study will also have important consequences for other micronutrient health programs, such as vitamin A supplementation for children above 6 months of age and iron supplementation in areas with endemic malaria, as these are also subject to the effects of the acute phase response

Vaccine to Prevent West Nile Virus Disease This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine intended to prevent West Nile virus (WNV) infection and determine if it causes side effects. WNV symptoms may vary from fever and headache, to a polio-like syndrome with paralysis. Infection rarely results in death. The vaccine used in this study contains DNA that instructs the body to produce a small amount of a protein found in WNV. If the body creates resistance or immunity to these proteins, then the vaccine may protect against WNV. Study participants cannot get WNV from the vaccine.  Healthy volunteers between 18 years and 50 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests, including a pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant. Patients undergo the following tests and procedures:  * Vaccine injections: Vaccines are given as injections in the upper arm, using a needleless system called the Biojector 2000. The first injection is on study day 0, the second on day 28 (+/-) 7 days, and the third on day 56 (+/-) 7 days. There must be at least 21 days between injections. The pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential is repeated the day of each vaccine injection. * Diary card: Participants are given a 5-day diary card after each injection to record their temperature and any symptoms and side effects they may experience for up to 5 days after the injection. The diary cards are returned to the clinic at visits scheduled 2 weeks after each injection. Side effects and symptoms also must be reported immediately to a study nurse or doctor, and a clinic visit may be required for an examination. * Clinic visits: At day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32, participants have a medical history, physical examination (if needed) and blood tests. Vital signs and weight are also recorded. Lymph nodes are examined at day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, and urine samples are collected at day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.  Some of the blood drawn during this study is used for genetic tests to see if different types of immune response to a vaccine are related to genetic differences in people.

Anesthetic Management in Fetoscopic Surgery and Incidence of Complications Fetoscopic surgery has been acknowledged to be a reliable procedure to correct several congenital anomalies e.g. shunt insertion in fetal bladder outlet obstruction, laser ablation of vessels in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), balloon occlusion in congenital diaphragmatic hernia etc. The technique involves an introduction of small-caliber instruments into the amniotic cavity under ultrasound guidance. This procedure can be successfully done under either general anesthesia, regional anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation. Each technique has both advantages and drawbacks.  Several complications related to anesthetic after fetoscopic surgery can occur. For instance, pulmonary edema which is caused by intravenous fluid loading, irrigation fluid absorption or fluid flow through myometrium venous channel. Besides, maternal hypotension intraoperatively can arise from spinal anesthesia.  The aim of the study is to report choice of anesthesia using in fetoscopic surgery in the tertiary care institute (Siriraj hospital) and incidence of complications which may relate to different anesthetic techniques.

A-Health RCT: Effects of Participatory Art-based Activity on Health of Older Community Dwellers The overall objective of the study is to examine the effects of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) participatory art-based activity on wellbeing, quality of life and health condition in older community dwellers.  Aging is often associated with worsening health and withdrawal from social activities, both increasing the risk of a poor quality of life. It has been reported that the practice of art, especially participatory art-based activity enhances wellbeing, quality of life and health condition of patients and older adults. Since October 2015, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA; Quebec, Canada) has successfully initiated a participatory art-based activity known as "Les Beaux-Jeudis" for older community dwellers living in Montreal. Recently, the investigator demonstrated that the MMFA participatory art-based activity improved wellbeing, quality of life and health condition of Montreal older community dwellers using a pre-post single arm, prospective and longitudinal design: it was not a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which is the gold standard to examine the effects of an intervention.

Electrical Stimulation for the Treatment of Chronic Post-Stroke Shoulder Pain Using the Smartpatch System The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of electricity) reduces post-stroke shoulder pain. This study involves a device called the Smartpatch System. The Smartpatch System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the muscles in the shoulder. The Smartpatch System includes a small wire (called a "Lead") that is placed through the skin into the muscle of the shoulder. It also includes a device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the Smartpatch Stimulator).
Southampton Mealtime Assistance Study The primary objective of the study is to determine if the use of volunteers employed specifically to focus on mealtime assistance can increase food and nutrient intake of patients admitted to an acute Care of the Elderly ward. The sustainability of providing helpers to increase dietary intake over a year will be assessed and linked to actual dietary intake. The secondary objectives are to assess the association between dietary intake resulting from mealtime assistance and patient satisfaction, malnutrition risk, body composition, grip strength, length of hospital stay and hospital mortality.
Contingency Management for Drug Use: Does Age Matter? The OVERALL AIM is to assess whether app-based incentives are effective for older adults and to quantify the associations between age and both the efficacy and take-up of app-based incentives. This will allow us to determine if older adults with substance use disorders (SUDs) are willing to engage with app-based incentives and whether they perform similarly to their younger counterparts. Because the study will leverage data from an existing study on app-based incentives, a small add-on study is sufficient to address these three aims. This aim will be achieved while simultaneously gathering data that will shed light on the two aims of the first phase of the study: whether app-based incentives are effective overall, and how to optimize the size of incentives over time to maximize their effectiveness.
Effectivness and Safety of Acupuncture Combined With Moxibustion for Allergic Rhinitis A multi-centre clinical trial done by us（ISRCEN90807007）showed that active acupuncture had significantly greater effect on symptoms of allergic rhinitis than either sham acupuncture or no active treatment. The object of that study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for allergic rhinitis. As an explanatory research, acupuncture was defined as the only intervention for treatment group and sham acupuncture, no active treatment as its control groups. Besides, acupuncture combined moxibustion showed better and longer effect than acupuncture on allergic rhinitis patients in our previous pilot study. According to this result, we are taking a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to further evaluate whether acupuncture combined moxibustion is more effective than conventional treatment.

Dopamine D-2 Antagonist Use in Poor Responders in IVF: a Randomized Controlled Trial Metoclopramide is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist with antiemetic and gastrokinetic properties which has been approved for use in pregnant women. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been found to have lower dopaminergic tone and increased ovarian vascularity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared to controls. During ovarian stimulation, PCOS patients exhibit greater sensitivity to gonadotropins and increased follicular development. Administration of dopamine D2 antagonists may mimic the low dopaminergic tone noted in PCOS patients, increase VEGF levels, angiogenesis, and subsequently improve follicular growth during ovarian stimulation. This strategy could be used to improve IVF outcomes in poor responders.  The investigators hypothesize that, compared to gonadotropin use alone, the use of metoclopramide in combination with gonadotropins in poor responders undergoing IVF will result in an increased number of mature oocytes obtained at oocyte retrieval and improved IVF outcomes.
A Single-dose and Multiple-dose Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of DBPR108 Tablets in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single-dose and multiple-dose of DBPR108 tablets in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.
Improving Emotion Regulation Skills Among Adolescents Attempting to Lose Weight While the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has plateaued, national data indicate that approximately 35% of children and adolescents continue to struggle with overweight/obesity. While considerable attention has been given to comprehensive behavioral interventions to address obesity in children, there is less empirical evidence demonstrating efficacy of interventions with adolescents. Additionally, there is great variability and limited impact of adolescent weight control interventions which may be attributable to the failure of these interventions to explicitly address emotion regulation abilities that are necessary for weight loss. Notably, adolescents with poorer general emotion regulation have been found to consume more snack/junk food and report greater amounts of sedentary behavior. Poor emotion regulation among adolescents has also been associated with more rapid weight gain and greater BMI. This project adapts a previously validated Emotion Regulation intervention (TRAC) for at-risk adolescents, targeting sexual risk reduction, to focus on weight loss among a sample of overweight and obese adolescents (ages 12 to 18). While sexual risk and weight management are distinct health behaviors, this same model of emotion regulation could be applied to overweight/obese adolescents attempting to lose weight. In fact, data from overweight/obese adolescents attending a past outpatient weight management program (N=124) indicate that 82% of these youth report emotion regulation scores that are comparable to youth with significant mental health problems. Furthermore, higher levels of emotional dysregulation was associated with greater BMI within this same sample. These data suggest that emotion regulation is related to health decision making and will be relevant to the majority of overweight/obese adolescents seeking to lose weight. The current study will be carried out across Phase 1a and 1b. During Phase 1a, the initial acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention (HEALTH TRAC) with eight adolescents in an open pilot trial will be evaluated. During Phase 1b, 48 adolescents between the ages of 13-17 years will be randomized to receive either the HEALTH TRAC or standard behavioral weight control intervention (SBWC) and examine the impact on emotion regulation abilities and BMI status over an eight-month period. The information gained in this project will improve understanding of strategies to improve weight loss outcomes among overweight/obsess adolescents and how improving emotion regulation abilities can enhance these interventions.

Evaluation of South Africa's National Adherence Strategy NOTE THAT THE STUDY IS LED BY SOUTH AFRICA NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WORLD BANK WITH SUPPORT FROM BOSTON UNIVERSITY. The South Africa National Department of Health (NDOH) intends to launch its newly developed National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases (HIV, TB and NCDs) throughout South Africa in the coming year. Early implementation of the "minimum package" of interventions described in the Adherence Guidelines for HIV patients will take place at 12 primary health clinics and community health centres in four provinces starting in July 2015. To maximize the learning potential of this early implementation stage, NDOH will match the intervention clinics with 12 comparison clinics and randomly allocate intervention or comparison status within the pairs of clinics. This will allow the outcomes of the interventions to be evaluated using a cluster-randomized design and generate data on the costs of implementation and the potential need for adherence support for the other diseases addressed in the guidelines (tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes). This protocol is for the evaluation, which will generate information on the effectiveness of minimum package interventions and help improve the design, implementation, and budgeting of the guidelines.
Role of Sarcopenia and Nutritional/Physical Therapy Intervention in Post-TIPS Hepatic Encephalopathy The placement of TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) is the most effective strategy to treat complications of portal hypertension. However, the threat of developing post-TIPS complications diminishes its use and applicability. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is the most feared and frequent post-TIPS complication, affecting between 25-54% of patients. Available treatments against HE are only partially effective. Therefore, the best existing strategy is to accurately select patients for TIPS excluding those presenting known high risk factors associated to post-TIPS HE. Despite applying this approach, the incidence of post-TIPS HE still remains very high. The investigators hypothesize that a better identification of risk factors for post-TIPS HE, together with the introduction of therapeutic interventions modulating pathophysiological mechanisms involved in post-TIPS HE development - among which sarcopenia stands out- would lead to a reduction in the incidence of HE and, eventually, to an increase in the number of patients benefiting from TIPS.  Thus, our project is aimed at  1. Demonstrate that a 12 weeks lifestyle intervention based on resistance training and nutritional counseling can reduce sarcopenia and, ultimately, post-TIPS HE. 2. To study predictive factors of post-TIPS HE, focusing on the role of factors that have never been evaluated in the setting of TIPS: gut microbiome and cognitive function
The Epidemiology, Management and Comorbidities in Alopecia Areata in Czech Republic The study series consists of three studies with the aim to assess the incidence, prevalence, risk factors, comorbidities and management of patients with alopecia areata in Czech Republic based on the patients and registry of a dermatology clinic of a metropolitan hospital.
Efficacy Study of Radiotherapy Alone Versus CCRT With Temozolomide in Grade III Gliomas Without 1p/19q Codeletion 1. The management of anaplastic gliomas of WHO grade 3 is currently largely based on surgery followed by radiotherapy, of which prognosis remains still dismal with the median survival of 2-5 years. To date, the benefit of chemo for WHO grade 3 gliomas is unclear of modest at best with conventional cytotoxic agents, and the role of temozolomide for these entities still is not elucidated. 2. Codeletion of chromosome 1p/19q is considered the most important marker of prognostic significance in WHO grade 3 gliomas. 3. To project a randomized phase 2 screening trial examining the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide for WHO grade 3 gliomas without codeletion of chromosome 1p/19q. 4. The prognostic significance of methylation status of MGMT and IDH1 mutation as molecular markers will be also assessed in each arm as key secondary analysis.
Enhancing Exposure Therapy for Snake and Spider Phobias This study tests whether exposure therapy for fear of snakes or spiders is enhanced by the addition of a brief fear retrieval trial prior to treatment, and the use of compound extinction during treatment. The goal of the study is to determine whether these behavioral techniques enhance the efficacy of exposure therapy, one of the most empirically supported treatments for anxiety disorders.

Weaning From Nasal High Flow Therapy Nasal high flow is widely used in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. It has been shown to improve patient comfort, increase oxygenation and reduce need for intubation in some patients. The Respiratory Oxygenation (ROX) index has been established as a simple tool to help clinicians identify those patients who will succeed and those who will fail under nasal high flow and therefore predict the need for intubation. However, when nasal high flow therapy is successful, little is known as to how and when weaning of this device should be performed and what are the predictors of a safe withdrawal of the device. The objectives of this retrospective exploratory study are to identify a cut-off value of the ROX index predictive of success of the withdrawal trial, to describe a one-year use of the withdrawal trial; to describe the ROX value closest to weaning from nasal high flow, and to identify factors associated with success or failure of the withdrawal trial from nasal high flow therapy in patients receiving nasal high flow therapy.
Repurposed Drugs to Improve Haematological Responses in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Over 7,000 people in the UK are living with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). Approximately 1,600 of these individuals (23%) die each year from their disease. MDS affects the production of blood cells by the bone marrow, causing chronic fatigue, bleeding, and recurrent infections. Many patients die because their disease transforms into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) an even more aggressive blood cancer. The general outlook for AML is poor, but when AML arises from MDS it is worse.  REPAIR-MDS seeks to repurpose existing drugs in order to dramatically improve the outlook, health and quality of life of people with MDS. The trial treatments aim to improve the production of healthy functioning blood and immune cells that will fight against infections and boost the immune system's action against the MDS clone.  REPAIR-MDS design is a is a multicentre open label phase 2 randomised controlled trial which will compare VBaP (sodium valproate, bezafibrate, medroxyprogesterone) with danazol in patients who have received either Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) and lost response, not responded to ESAs or are deemed unlikely to respond to ESAs.
Glutamatergic Amino Acids and Oxytocin Levels in the Plasma of Patients in First Psychotic Episode (FPE)- Before and After Neuroleptic Treatment The goal of our research is to check the levels of D-Serine, Glycine, and other Glutamatergic amino acids, in patients with First Psychotic Episode (FPE). These patients are in the early stage of the disease, treated with neuroleptics for short periods of time, and are usually hospitalized for the first time. The hypothesis of the research is that we will find low levels of Glycine and D-Serine in these patients. Following an Anti-psychotic treatment we will expect these levels to return to the norm, and that this correction will be accompanied by a reduction of positive and negative symptoms.  In addition, we will check the D-Serine and Glycine levels in the plasma of first degree relatives of the patients and a group of healthy subjects. The results of this study might support the hypothesis that the Glutamatergic system in involved in the pathology of Schizophrenia from it's early stages.  In addition, we will check the levels of Oxytocin and Estrogen in the plasma of patients in FPE. Our hypothesis is that we will find low levels of Estrogen and High levels of Oxytocin in this group of patients. The results of the study might support the hypothesis that Estrogen and Oxytocin are involved in the pathology of Schizophrenia from it's early stages.
Spectral Characteristics of Memory Transformation Sometimes, it is necessary to re-learn a previously learned movement behavior, for example, a bad posture during the golf drive or while playing the piano. Unlearning or relearning an intensively trained behavior is particularly important if the behavior is hampering recovery, for example, in chronic pain or after a stroke. With this pilot study, the brain mechanisms that control the change of pre-existing stable memories of a motor skill will be tested with electroencephalography (EEG). Non-invasive brain stimulation will be used to modulate these brain mechanisms and test if it is possible to change the pre-existing motor memory and the learning of a new motor skill.
Cerebral Lesions and Outcome After Cardiac Surgery (CLOCS) Between 1 and 5 percent of patients who have coronary artery bypass surgery suffer a stroke following surgery, and 30 percent have new brain lesions that do not produce symptoms and are seen only on MRI. In addition, up to 40 percent of patients develop long-term cognitive impairment. This study will identify risk factors that predict whether a person undergoing heart surgery will develop cerebral infarcts after surgery. It will also identify operative and inflammatory factors that may alter the risk, and will evaluate whether the small lesions are associated with cognitive decline at 6 months.  People 18 years of age or older who will undergo coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), heart valve replacement, or combined CABG and valve replacement procedure are eligible for this study. Candidates must have no neurological or cognitive impairment before surgery.  Participants will undergo standard medical and surgical treatment as determined by their physicians. In addition, they have the following procedures:  * Medical and neurological evaluation before surgery and 24 and 48 hours after surgery. * Brain MRI before surgery, and 48 hours, 30 days and 6 months after surgery. * Blood draws before surgery, immediately after surgery, and 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after surgery to quantify the response of their inflammatory system to surgery. * Neuropsychological examinations 30 days and 6 months after surgery. * In addition, patients who agree to enroll in a substudy that will explore whether differences in the genes coding for inflammatory molecules lead to a change in the risk of iscjhemia after heart surgery, will have extra blood drawn for genetic analysis.
Direct Stimulation Of Spinal Nerve Roots To Determine Sensory And Motor Innervation Patterns The purpose of this study is to collect data while monitoring muscles and nerves during spine surgery.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Effect on Post Concussion Syndrome in Children Due its high incidence, mTBI and its consequences of PPCS are a major public health issue. There is no consensus regarding the treatment of PPCS in pediatrics. Relying on its results in adults, HBOT offers a promising new direction of treatment, which targets the basic pathological processes responsible for post-concussion symptoms.  The effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in pediatric TBI has never been evaluated.  The aim of the current study is to evaluate in a prospective cross-over, randomized study, the effect of HBOT on children with PPCS due to mild TBI.

Evaluation of Tangible Boost for Patients With Stevens Johnson Syndrome, Sjogren's Syndrome, and Graft Vs Host Disease The goal of this research is to determine if the Tangible Boost system adequately replenishes the Hydra-PEG coating on the surface of a rigid contact lens.  Hydra-PEG is a coating for soft and rigid contact lens, primarily composed of polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel, which is covalently bound to the surface of a contact lens. The Hydra-PEG coating is intended to improve wettability and comfort with contact lenses and is currently FDA approved on a number of contact lenses. For patients with Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) (SS), or Graft versus Host disease (GVHD), diminished efficacy of the Hydra-PEG coating can lead to significant decline in satisfaction with the lenses over time. This is a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of Tangible Boost, a monthly conditioning solution, to replenish the Hydra-PEG coating on rigid gas permeable contact lenses for patients with SJS, GVHD, and SS. Outcomes from this patient population will be compared to patients with dry eye disease.

Novel PET/CT Imaging Biomarkers of CB-839 in Combination With Panitumumab and Irinotecan in Patients With Metastatic and Refractory RAS Wildtype Colorectal Cancer This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 and how well it works with panitumumab and irinotecan hydrochloride (phase I only) in treating patients with RAS wildtype colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body and does not respond to treatment. Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 with panitumumab and irinotecan hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.
Feasibility Study Testing Transcriptional Responses as an Indicator of Individualised Responses to Radiation Effects Peripheral blood samples will be taken with informed consent from radiotherapy patients undergoing standard radiotherapy at The Royal Marsden before and during treatment for breast, lung, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tumours. Responses from panels of up to 800 coding and non-coding RNAs will be assessed in the samples using the nCounter system. Candidate genes identified by Public Health England, Columbia University and/or in the literature as being specific to radiation responses will be included, together with genes relevant to systemic inflammatory responses, to identify transcriptional responses for a range of doses and exposures on an inter-individual basis. Data will be analysed using existing and new statistical tools focused on count data modelling. The intended outcome is identification of a radiation specific panel of genes to inform individual radiation responses and if the results are favourable, a large scale follow up to this proposed pilot is expected in due course.
A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics (PK, the Measure of How the Human Body Processes a Substance) of ETX0282 When Administered Orally to Healthy Participants This research project is being conducted to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of oral ETX0282 when administered alone and in combination with cefpodoxime proxetil in healthy adult participants.
Human Oral Detection of Glucose Olygomers Although salivary contents play a major role in the early stage of food digestion process, their role in taste perception of glucose polymers is essentially unknown. It is hypothesized that the differences in salivary contents, more specifically salivary amylase concentration and activity, influence taste perception of glucose polymers and ultimately eating behavior, which is related to risks in various diseases. The current project will investigate the variation in salivary contents across individuals and its role in taste perception of glucose polymers.
A Community Health Worker Home Intervention to Improve Pediatric Asthma Outcomes The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that a home-based asthma intervention, the Wee Wheezers program, delivered by the Community Health Workers and tailored to the needs of the investigators community, will improve anti-inflammatory medication adherence, parental asthma knowledge and management behaviors, which in turn will reduce asthma morbidity (defined as days with asthma symptoms) and health care utilization (defined as asthma-related Emergency Department visits) among low-income, minority children with persistent asthma in the Bronx.
A Mixed Method to Study Adherence to Oral Anticancer Medications in a Multilingual and Multicultural Setting Patients with haematologic malignancies are increasingly treated by Oral Anticancer Medications (OAMs), increasing the challenge of ensuring optimal adherence to treatment. However, except for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) or Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL), the extent of non-adherence has rarely been investigated in an outpatient setting. In Belgium, the only available data suffers from critical underrepresentation of patients from minority diverse population. In the context of increasing migration, the identification of differences in access and drug use that may lead to health disparities is crucial. Based on a sequential mixed method study design, our objectives are to measure adherence to OAMs in two subgroups of non-migrants and migrants with various haematological malignancies, to identify the associated risk factors and to explore the representations that come into play with regards to illness and adherence behaviors. Essentially, the MADESIO protocol will contribute to assess whether and why patients with migrant backgrounds are a risk group regarding adherence to OAMs.

Lenalidomide Therapy In Previously Untreated, Advanced Stage Follicular Lymphoma The purpose of this study is to see if a treatment with Lenalidomide, which is a pill given by mouth for 7.5 months (30 weeks total), can delay the growth of lymphoma or shrink the lymphoma. Lenalidomide is a pill that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is used to treat some forms of cancer-like illnesses (myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood). This drug works by stimulating the body's immune system and by reducing the blood supply to cancer cells. Cancer cells need blood to live and grow. In this study, the drug is considered a new or experimental drug because we are learning how it works against your form of lymphoma.

ADHerence of ticagrelOr in Real World Patients With aCute Coronary Syndrome Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily treatment is recommended for 12 months in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in patients undergoing coronary revascularization and conservative strategies. Recent data from the PEGASUS-TIMI 541 trial have shown that long-term treatment with ticagrelor reduced the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE) in stable ambulatory patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Based on these data, prolongation over 12 months of ticagrelor therapy could be indicated in selected patients; even if with such a prolongation some adverse effects on the treatment could be observed. In the PLATO2 trial, where median duration of exposure to the study drug was 277 days, the suspension of ticagrelor therapy was 7.4% in ticagrelor versus 6% in patients receiving clopidogrel ( P \<0.001). Ticagrelor treatment interruption was mainly driven by non-serious adverse events occurring mainly shortly after randomization. For patients after the first year of treatment, the subsequent rate of interruption was low. These data demonstrate that adverse events considered "not serious" by traditional trial criteria may have an effect on quality of life and, therefore, can cause treatment interruption; The phenomenon emphasizes at the same time the importance of patient education and advice on timing and the nature of adverse effects in order to improve adherence. Patients in the real world may show a premature suspension rate of the drug even higher than in clinical trials. However, data from real-world patients is scarce.

The Relationship of Trunk Control With Lower Extremity Sense, Balance and Gait in Stroke Cerebrovascular accident is the third leading cause of death in developed countries after heart disease and cancer. In adults, it ranks first among neurological diseases in terms of causing death and disability. About one-third of stroke patients experience permanent physical dysfunction. This situation has a negative impact on the economic, social, psychological life and general quality of life of the patient and his family. Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability in adults due to problems such as activity limitations and participation restrictions caused by disorders in body functions. Movement disorder is one of the most common symptoms of stroke, and people with stroke often have trouble falling while walking after they are discharged from the hospital. Therefore, one of the main goals of stroke rehabilitation is to regain independent mobility with a safe and stable gait pattern. In addition to all these, one of the problems faced by most stroke patients is sensory-perception disorders. Sensory impairment can be experienced as the inability to perceive the senses or the inability to distinguish the senses. It should be considered that sensory awareness decreases as more than one sensory impulse competes with each other at the same time, and this situation should not be ignored during the evaluation. Although motor movement is governed by the normal motor field, the adjustment of our position in space is entirely the task of the sensory field. It is not possible to initiate and coordinate movement without sensory control. Since environmental change cannot be perceived during movement, it is not possible to provide environmental adaptation.
Fentanyl Versus Midazolam As Additives To Bupivacaine In Ultrasound Guided Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Pain triggers a complex biochemical and physiological stress response leading to impairment of pulmonary, immunological and metabolic functions.  The Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block, is a regional anaesthesia technique used for various surgeries through the lower to mid-abdominal wall.The addition of fentanyl to the local anaesthetic in ultrasound-guided TAP block prolongs the analgesia, lowers postoperative pain, and decreases the opioid consumption. Adding midazolam as a bupivacaine adjuvant for TAP block reduces the 24-h morphine consumption extends the postoperative analgesia duration. The aim of the work is to study the effect of the addition fentanyl and midazolam on the onset, duration of the analgesic effect of Tap block intraoperative fentanyl consumption, Time for first rescue Analgesia.  in patients undergoing simple unilateral abdominal surgeries.

The study is composed of a 28-day Screening Period during which participants are screened for entry into this study, followed by a treatment period of up to 2 years from Cycle 1 Day 1.
SNE1725: Can Oral Glutamine Facilitate Early Return of Gut Function The gastrointestinal tract has many functions; it provides nutrition, produces hormones, performs a barrier function, maintains a stable gastrointestinal micro flora and plays an important role in the inflammatory process as it is the largest producer of cytokines (proteins associated with inflammation). This gut function is impaired after colorectal (bowel) surgery. There is evidence to suggest that impaired gut function is associated with increased complications. Hence if gut function is preserved, it should equate with better outcomes. As a result, there has been increasing interest in treatments called Gut Specific Nutrients (GSN), which specifically target gut function. Most notable of them is Glutamine, a conditionally essential amino acid and preferred fuel source for intestinal cells. Research has shown that glutamine promotes cell growth, increases clearance of harmful organisms from the blood, and reduces the surgical stress response. In other words, glutamine has a favourable influence on gut function.  Recent studies from our unit using intravenous glutamine in critically ill patients have shown an early return of gut function, which in turn is associated with attenuation of the inflammatory response and improved outcomes. It is not known whether oral glutamine is associated with a similar outcome. A recent pilot study at our unit suggests an association between oral glutamine and early return of gut function. The aim of this research is to determine if giving oral glutamine results in an early return of gut function and whether this is associated with an attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response.
4D FLOW: Feasibility Study of a Sequence 4D of Flow Applied to the Cervico-encephalic Vascular Pathologies The dynamic angio-MR sequences with injection of contrast (CE ARM) allow the study of the vascular anatomy. These sequences, widely used in clinical routine have shown their utility, in particular in the detection of the cerebrovascular diseases. The 4D flow MR sequences allow to quantify arterial parameters such as the speed of the circulating flow. By allowing an anatomical analysis and a functional analysis of quantitative parameters, 4D flow MR sequences could replace 1/ the currently used dynamic MRA sequences that are less precise in term of spatial and temporal resolution; 2/ the invasive exploration by DSA for the detection of vascular lesion and complete the exploration of the cervico-encephalic vascular pathologies by providing hemodynamical measures not yet accessible in clinical settings.  In this context, the aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and the clinical usefulness of this 4D Flow technique to image brain vascular disorders including steno occlusive disorders. The evaluation will include several steps: 1/ optimization of acquisition parameters for the cranio-cervical arteries; 2/ comparison of two strategies for the post-processing 3/ feasibility for imaging of brain vascular disorders.

Immunogenicity and Safety of Adjuvanted SCB-2020S Vaccines in Adults This is a phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of different formulations of the investigational adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein (from B.1.351 variant) subunit vaccine (SCB-2020S), when administered as 2-dose vaccination series 21 days apart to adults ≥ 18 years of age.
Assessing Colonic Folate Absorption & Metabolism Folate, a B-vitamin, is necessary in metabolic processes such as amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. Since folate cannot be synthesized by mammals, it must be consumed as foods and dietary supplements or generated by bacteria present in the colon. There are many known adverse health outcomes associated with folate deficiency in humans such as neural tube defects in newborns and colorectal cancer in adults. It has also been proposed that supra-physiological folate status can also be detrimental since it can lead to changes in immune function and the masking of vitamin B12 deficiency. It is generally believed that dietary sources of folate are primarily absorbed in the small intestine, however recent evidence suggests the colon may play a more significant role in the absorption of folate than previously understood. The aim of this study is to assess how folic acid supplementation influences colonic folate absorption and metabolism in humans. This will be accomplished by assessing the expression of two major folate transporters responsible for folate absorption in the colon. Participants will be randomized to receive multivitamins with either 0 or 400 µg folic acid during a 16-week randomized clinical trial in which blood and colonic tissue biopsies will be collected and analyzed. The total folate concentrations and expression of folate transporters in colonocytes will be measured to confirm levels and evaluate the impact of supplemental folic acid. The expression of two folate hydrolases responsible for converting naturally occurring folate to its bioavailable form will also be evaluated. This work will lead to a deeper understanding of colonic folate absorption and metabolism, resulting in more appropriate dietary and supplemental folate recommendations.
Safety and Efficacy of Neutralizing Antibodies and Vaccination for Induction of HIV Remission This is a phase I, randomized, open-label trial to investigate the safety of VRC07-523LS, PGDM1400LS and N-803 in combination with Ad26.Mos4.HIV, MVA-Bavarian Nordic (BN)-HIV and A244d11gp120/ALFQ vaccination, and the impact on time to sustained viral rebound of ≥1000 copies/mL for 4 consecutive weeks during analytic treatment interruption (ATI) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1, PLWH) who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI).

Treatment of Malaria in Gabon With Fosmidomycin-Clindamycin Some antibiotics are also effective against malaria parasites. Fosmidomycin is an antibiotic that has been shown to be effective against malaria, although it cannot achieve a total cure in all patients. A previous small study has shown that in combination with clindamycin, an commonly used antibiotic, it is highly effective and safe, in asymptomatic carriers of malaria parasites. The current study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination given for three days in children with uncomplicated malaria in Gabon.
Random Urine Protein-creatinin Ratio to Predict Magnitude of Proteinuria The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of the spot urinary proteinuria, random urine protein- creatinin ratio for prediction of significant proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24h) and magnitude of proteinuria in patients with in mild preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia. The cross-sectional longitudinal study design used, 209 patients with pre-diagnosed preeclampsia in which in our inpatients clinic included this study. Random urine samples were taken before the 24 hour urine collection for spot urine analysis for evaluated proteinuria and protein/creatinin ratio. 24 hour urine analysis was performed in all patients as the gold standard of the urine total proteinuria.
Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings (COMPUTE 2.0) Through CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders in Medical Settings: Pilot Usability Testing in an EMR (COMPUTE)), our team has iteratively developed and piloted a web-based and electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-CDS has been implemented within the EPIC EHR of one large care system and was piloted with 55 providers to ensure content validity and provider satisfaction. The team will now implement this OUD-CDS in a large multi-site clinic-randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact on practice process measures and patient outcomes. The investigators also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., integration into usual primary care practice after the study is complete) and dissemination by evaluating facilitators and barriers to implementation, determining the costs of implementation and maintenance, and assessing the short-term cost impacts of the OUD-CDS.  The study will include three large diverse care systems and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive the OUD-CDS intervention or usual care (UC). In intervention clinics, the OUD-CDS will identify patients who are at high risk for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each patient's current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the OUD-CDS user interface; and store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will run invisibly in the background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored to each eligible patient's needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits.

Evaluation of the Impact of a Forward Viewing Scope at Time of ERCP This study will be a prospective, tandem-designed study to determine the proportion of clinically significant missed lesions when using a side- or oblique-viewing endoscope as compared to the standard forward-viewing endoscope. Utilizing standard endoscopy protocols in current practice at Brigham and Women's Hospital, consecutive adult patients undergoing ERCP for traditional reasons will undergo back-to-back tandem EGD and ERCP examinations. This process entails an EGD performed by an attending gastroenterologist first. Next, a second blinded attending gastroenterologist will perform ERCP immediately after index EGD. Both endoscopists will note any clinically significant findings, independent of the other providers procedural findings. Clinically significant findings defined as endoscopic findings that alter patient management (i.e., esophageal varices, peptic ulcer disease, hemorrhage, mass, etc.) during EGD and ERCP will be recorded. As previously stated, some institutions already routinely perform EGD with every ERCP.
FibroScan™ in Pediatric Cholestatic Liver Disease (FORCE) Noninvasive monitoring of liver fibrosis is an unmet need within the clinical management of pediatric chronic liver disease. While liver biopsy is often used in the initial diagnostic evaluation, subsequent biopsies are rarely performed because of inherent invasiveness and risks. This study will evaluate the role of non-invasive FibroScan™ technology to detect and quantify liver fibrosis.
Outcome of Moderate Severity in OPC Poisoning Patients When Treated With Pralidoxime This open level randomized controlled trial will be conducted in the department of medicine at Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital. Clinical severity will be assessed by the POP (Peradeniya Organophosphorus Poisoning) scale of admitted patients having a history of organophosphorus poisoning within 24 hours with clinical features and physical evidence of poisoning consumed. Only moderate severity (POP Scale score 4-7) of OPC (Organophosphorus compound) patients will be included in this study. Then one group of patients will be treated with atropine and pralidoxime and another group will be treated with atropine. The outcome will be noted as clinical improvement or recovery. hospital stay, requirement of ICU, death.
Adenoma Detection Rate in Water and Air Colonoscopy Using Computer-aided System Water exchange (WE) is an effective insertion method to minimize insertion discomfort and maximize ADR. It is characterized by infusing water to guide insertion in an airless lumen with suctioning of infused water during insertion and almost complete removal of the infused water when cecal intubation is achieved. A modified Delphi review reported water exchange showed the highest overall ADR, ADR in screening cases, and in the right side of the colon compared with water immersion and air (or CO2) insufflation. One of the plausible mechanisms of improving ADR by water exchange is salvage cleaning during insertion, which might help artificial intelligence by removing the interference of fecal debris and bubbles. However, no RCT has been performed to evaluate the effect of CADe on WE colonoscopy.  Therefore, investigators will conduct a RCT comparing the ADR of CADe assisted colonoscopy inserted with either WE or insufflation. Our hypothesis will be that CADe assisted WE colonoscopy achieves higher ADR than CADe assisted air insufflation colonoscopy.
Evaluation of a Commercial Gaming Impact in a Childhood Obesity Intervention Recently, researchers have been interested in the use of game play, mechanics and psychology for health-related engagement and behavior change. While initial studies have shown some increases in health knowledge and/or behavior through gaming, there remains concern that the vehicle for change is associated with a perceived sedentary behavior (6).  More recently, commercially available gaming devices are able to directly promote physical activity through a new set of "kinetic controllers" added to the gaming experience. UHG plans to evaluate the most recent of these kinetic controller technologies in the context of a second iteration of JOIN (described above) to be implemented among a pilot group of overweight and/or obese children whose BMI percentile is above the 85th.  This study will evaluate the effect of a commercial controller-free Exercise Gaming and Entertainment Experience (EGEE) on physical activity levels in the context of a weight management program in approximately 70 children ages 6 to12. The study will compare the differences in physical activity levels over 16 weeks in two groups of children.

Impact of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Strategy After Surgery of Skin Carcinomas in Older Patients Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence as well as morbidity rates are high in older patients. Surgery is the standard of care. About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR).  Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence. Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to unfavorable prognostic factors. ART benefit is generally questioned in regard to the potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no prospective trial or recommendations that take into account geriatric patients' evaluation and profiles during the management of NMSC. In addition, there is no data that could help to define the subgroup of elderly patients who will benefit from ART in tumors with unfavorable prognostic factors.  In terms of ART, multiple fractionation schedules are available, ranging from standard fractionation (45-60Gy in 5-6 weeks) to the extreme hypofractionation (HF) delivering 16-18Gy in one fraction.  In routine practice, HF is mainly preferred in elderly patients for more convenience by reducing the number of transports and increase health related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is no data on the fragility profiles of these patients, nor validating any HF schedule in terms of efficacy, acute toxicity, cosmetic results, and impact on HRQoL.  the main ain objective is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of two modalities of Radiotherapy over surgery alone on local tumor control in older patients with Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) In current practice, adjuvant radiotherapy is discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence as determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic factors. The proposed study will include R0-high risk of CBC and CEC of the skin in elderly patients. There is no risk regarding the design of the trial as the last will respond to two important unknown questions regarding the utility of RT and its fractionation in this population. Moreover, it is an excellent opportunity to collect prospectively geriatric evaluation and HRQoL data that are lacking in the literature for skin cancers. No constraints are seen neither in the design, nor in the potential recruitments.
Molehill Mountain Feasibility Study. Up to half of autistic people experience anxiety symptoms, which can have a significant impact on everyday wellbeing. However, there are currently very few effective, evidence-based interventions to support autistic people in managing anxiety; and many autistic people face barriers in accessing inperson health and social care services. Therefore, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety, in a way that meets the needs of autistic people, represents the autism community's number one priority for research and clinical practice.  Addressing this priority, the investigators will test the acceptability and feasibility of a new, app-based therapeutic approach for anxiety ('Molehill Mountain') that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people aged 12-years and over using adapted Cognitive Behavioural therapy principles. This means that information will be collected from autistic people accessing clinical services on whether they would choose to use the anxiety app, whether the app is simple to administer and use, how it is used, how it can be improved, and whether it is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms and/ or enhancing other outcomes, such as everyday wellbeing and functioning.  The evidence from this project will inform the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a randomised-controlled trial, with the ultimate aim of transforming long-term healthcare delivery for autistic people.
Comparison of Two Anaesthetics on Brain During Brain Tumour Surgery Anaesthesia and surgical stress during craniotomy can lead to brain damage and activation of inflammatory response. Consequently inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL10) are released. Cell mediated immune balance can increase postoperative complications (infections, wound healing, multiple organ dysfunction). Many studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics reduce systemic and local inflammatory response during major surgery, but animal studies have shown that volatile anaesthetics can induce neuroinflammation (IL6, NF-κB) that leads to decline of cognitive function in rodent and possible human.  Our aim was to investigate how anaesthetic technique for craniotomy influences the release of inflammatory cytokines. Our hypothesis was that when optimal neuroprotective strategies are followed during surgery intravenous anaesthesia attenuates inflammatory response comparing to inhalational anaesthesia.  The investigators included 40 patients anaesthetised with remifentanil based anaesthesia with sevoflurane (S group) or propofol (P group).  Plasma levels of IL6, IL8, IL10 were measured during preoperative, perioperative and postoperative periods of both groups of patients. The investigators also noted emergence parameters, postoperative (pain, shivering, vomiting) and neurological complications after surgery.
Intra-op Monitoring With NIRS and NICOM, and Surgical Outcome in Elderly Patients With Fractures of Lower Limbs In Taiwan, about 75.92% of the elderlies above 65 years old suffered from chronic diseases or major diseases, especially in circulatory system. Thus, dramatic hemodynamic change is often observed in surgeries in this population. Due to osteoporosis and high-prevalence morbidities, trauma with fracture is quite common. These elderlies are more vulnerable to have complications, poor prognosis and decompensated organ functions.  The investigators would like to observe the perfusion of different tissue intra-operatively, and to find the correlation with surgical outcome. There are many non-invasive hemodynamic monitors nowadays. In our study, the investigators will use noninvasive cardiac output measurement(NICOM), and non-invasive transcutaneous near infrared spectroscopy(NIRS) to observe hemodynamic change and tissue perfusion. After the surgery, the duration in ICU will be recorded. A questionnaire, SF-36, will be mailed to the patients 2 months after the surgery to measure the psychometric status.

Hormonal Changes in Early Pregnancy This study will analyze hormones in early pregnancy. Hormonal changes in early pregnancy reflect the quality of implantation in the uterus of the fertilized egg, the function of the corpus luteum (mass of hormone-secreting tissue that forms immediately after ovulation) and placenta, and the health of the embryo. It will determine the following:  * Whether early pregnancy hormones vary by characteristics of the mother * Whether early pregnancy hormones differ for pregnancies with male or female babies * Whether early pregnancy hormones can predict the gestational age (age of the baby during pregnancy) and the baby's birth weight * Hormone activity at the time pregnancy symptoms begin * How the contribution of the corpus luteum changes during the pregnancy in different women  Stored urine specimens collected from women who participated in the North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study in the 1980s will be used for this study. In addition, to evaluate the quality of the stored samples, new specimens will be collected from women currently enrolled in the University of North Carolina's Right from the Start study. Candidates must be white women not of Latino or Hispanic origin who are between 25 and 35 years of age and who are planning to become pregnant within a few months' time. They must be non-smokers, have regular menstrual cycles, no known fertility problems and no major chronic disease.  Urine specimens are analyzed for hormone levels and other changes in early pregnancy that can be measured in urine. Women providing new urine specimens do the following:  Pre-Pregnancy  The pre-pregnancy part of the study lasts through no more than three consecutive menstrual cycles. Participants who do not become pregnant after three menstrual cycles end the study at that time.  * Have a short interview with a study staff member * Complete a daily diary, recording any vaginal bleeding or spotting, health status, and use of medications, and mail the diary to the study office once a week * Use an ovulation testing kit for up to 7 days during their menstrual cycle * Call the study staff within the first 24 hours of becoming pregnant  Pregnancy  The pregnancy part of the study lasts about 5 weeks.  * Continue to complete daily diary records for weekly pickup by staff member * Collect urine samples daily and store them in the freezer for weekly pickup by staff member * Have 1 to 2 tablespoons of blood drawn at home weekly for 4 weeks * Have a brief follow-up telephone interview around week 12 of their pregnancy  Urine samples are analyzed for hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin, estrone-3-glucuronide, and pregnanedrol glucuronide. White blood cells are stored for DNA to study such things as genes controlling hormone metabolism.
Intraoral Scanners as Periodontal and Dental Pathologies Diagnosis Tools Periodontal diseases and dental pathologies are highly prevalent oral diseases. Thirty-three to fifty percent of adult population presented at least one untreated caries and more than 50% of French population are affected by severe periodontitis. These diseases affect dental organ or periodontal attached system but could have negative impact on general health, quality of life, word and individual well-being. Association between chronic diseases as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and oral health have been well investigated. Dental and periodontal diagnosis is dependent of various clinical parameters time consuming and dependent operator. It represents a public health challenge. Informatic analysis detecting diseases could be a time gain and a more precise diagnosis tool. Today, any software or algorithm allow automatized detection, clinical qualitative or quantitative indices recording while these informations are present in numeric models

Transanal Irrigation for the Management of LARS This study aims to evaluate the impact of Transanal irrigation (TAI) on the quality of life and low anterior resection symptoms (LARS) in Canadian rectal cancer survivors living with minor to major LARS. It proposes to teach TAI through a novel online platform and to provide virtual nursing support for the participants. To our knowledge, this is the first North American based and largest randomized control trial on the use of TAI for patients with LARS. This will also be the first study to teach and support patients through the TAI process using a virtual platform. While TAI has been demonstrated to reduce LARS scores and increased QoL in patients with significant LARS, its feasibility and acceptance for Canadian patients remains uncertain. Furthermore despite the existing studies, the rate of TAI seems to be low in North America. The hypothesis is that TAI, taught and supported through an online portal dedicated to LARS patients, will positively impact QoL and improve LARS symptoms. The results of this trial may allow TAI to become part of the standard armamentarium that clinicians offer patients for LARS management, with the presence of online nursing support and guidance to facilitate this practice.

Efficacy and Tolerability of Combination Antihypertensive Drug in Non-Responders to ARB monoTHerapy Using 24h ABPM A majority of Korean doctors tend to add other antihypertensive rather than to titrate the same drug.  However, we try to induce doctors to titrate the Sevikar than to add other antihypertensive if patients are not controlled with Sevikar 5/20mg(amlodipine 5mg + omlesartan 20mg). As above, for patients who are not controlled with Sevikar 5/20mg, doctors will proceed to other prescription pattern with other choices of titration to Sevikar 5/40, 10/40mg.  It is important to evaluate BP lowering efficacy of Sevikar through the titration step in patients uncontrolled with Sevikar low dose. Thus, this study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of Sevikar by titration in patients who are not controlled their BP with low dose of Sevikar.
Comparison of Steroid Dosages on the Efficacy of Trochanteric Bursa Injection Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa is a common cause of hip pain. A bursa is a closed fluid filled sac or sac-like cavity found between tissues that function as a gliding surface to reduce friction. Bursitis is the inflammation of the bursa. Inflammation between the trochanteric process of the femur and gluteus medius tendon/ iliotibial tract is the cause of trochanteric bursitis. Several treatments exist for trochanteric bursitis, including a local steroid injection. The injection consists of a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid medications. The steroid is routinely mixed with a local anesthetic. The anesthetic acts to diluent the steroid as well as act as a pain reliever. Various steroid preparations have been used, at varying doses, for trochanteric bursitis. The steroid preparation, triamcinolone is commonly used for various reasons. Besides the procedure associated and injection site risks, risks associated with the use of steroids, though rare, exist. Short term, the steroid can raise blood sugar levels and should be used with caution and be appropriately monitored in diabetics. Additionally, the steroid can suppress the immune system. Long-term risks are related to the dose and frequency of use. These risks include thinning of the skin, easy bruising, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, cataract formation, thinning of bones and joints. Studies have shown the effectiveness of local steroid injections for trochanteric bursitis. Unfortunately, there is limited data on the ideal dose of the steroid preparation. Triamcinolone of 40mg/ mL is commonly used, but, studies have shown effectiveness at various doses, ranging 20 to 160 mg/mL. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of local steroid injections of various steroid dosages for the treatment of trochanteric bursitis.

68Ga-DOTA-MGS5 PET/CT in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumours 68Ga-labelled \[DOTA0,DGlu1,desGlu2-6,(N-Me)Nle11,1-Nal13\]minigastrin (68Ga-DOTA-MGS5) is a novel radiopharmaceutical for intravenous administration for evaluation of the cholecystokinin receptor (CCK2R) status in patients with CCK2R-related malignancies. CCK2R is expressed at high incidence in medullary thyroid carcinomas (92%) and frequently expressed also in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET, 22%). In this phase I/IIa study the safety of administration and the biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-MGS5 will be evaluated in patients with advanced MTC as well as gastroenteropancreatic and bronchopulmonary NET. In addition, the visualization of tumour lesions as well as the absorbed organ and tumour radiation dose will be evaluated. The new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging modality has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with advanced MTC as well as gastroenteropancreatic and bronchopulmonary NET. After successful application in diagnostic imaging, CCK2R targeting with therapeutic radionuclides bears high potential also to improve the therapeutic management of patients with advanced disease.
Evaluation of an Online Lifestyle Intervention in Mexican School Children During COVID-19 Pandemic Introduction: School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic represent a risk factor for the development of childhood obesity due to the increase in unhealthy behaviors. Online lifestyle interventions in schoolchildren could help to mitigate this problem. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials have been performed to prevent obesity in schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 4-month online lifestyle intervention on the BMI Z-score of Mexican schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic in an intervention group compared to a control group. Methodology: This is a pilot randomized controlled trial. Schoolchildren from a public elementary school in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico will be invited to participate. Participants will be randomized to an intervention group (online lifestyle intervention) or a control group. The intervention will include online sessions of nutrition education and physical activity and nutrition information for parents. The control group will receive a digital brochure with nutrition recommendations at the beginning of the study. The measurements will be performed at baseline and 4 months. The primary outcome will be the BMI Z- score. Secondary outcomes: waist circumference, fat percentage, nutritional knowledge, lifestyle parameters, retention, attendance at the program sessions, and acceptability of the intervention. The difference between groups in changes in the outcomes will be analyzed using an intention to treat analysis. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sonora Nursing Department (EPM-003-2020). Conclusion: The study will provide the first evidence of the evaluation of online interventions for the prevention of obesity in schoolchildren derived from a Randomized Controlled Trial. This information will be important for the development and implementation of other school-level obesity prevention programs around the world.

Prevention of Preterm Birth in Singletons Using Pessary After Resolutive Threatened Preterm Labor In France, threatened preterm labour concerns 6.5% of pregnancies and is associated with a premature birth in 25.4% of cases.  After 48 hours effective tocolysis, patients do not receive any further treatment while their risk of premature birth has risen from 6.5% to 25%.  A pessary is a silicone ring encircling the cervix. It was initially used as medical treatment of genital prolapse but studies were also conducted for pregnant women in 2 high-risk premature birth situations: cervical incompetence and twin pregnancies.  The multicenter PECEP trial conducted by Goya and al. in asymptomatic short cervix patients between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation showed a significant reduction of premature birth before 34 and 37 weeks of gestation. Thereby, the investigator assume that use of pessaries in patients presenting a resolutive threatened preterm labor will also be effective.  To evaluate this hypothesis, the investigator designed a randomized prospective single-center open clinical trial comparing pessary associated with standard care (1st group) versus standard care only (2nd group) in patients experiencing an episode of resolutive threatened preterm labor.
Lamprene Multiple Patient Program Lamprene®/Clofazimine, is a product of the pharmaceutical company named Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Lamprene®/Clofazimine is approved by FDA (the U.S Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of leprosy. It is no longer available through pharmacies in the US. It is being tested in non-Novartis clinical studies for drug resistant tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).  To be eligible for participation in this expanded access program, patients must have an NTM diagnosis. The treating physician has decided that this infection can be treated with Lamprene®/Clofazimine. This medicine is provided to the physician in an expanded access program. This means that this medicine is not registered for the treatment of NTM, but it can be used in special situations where there are no other possible treatments. For example, this may be because the patient has a type of Mycobacterial infection that is resistant or failed to respond optimally to other drugs, or because the patient has had side effects that prevent the use of other drugs. The physician must submit a patient registration form to initiate the patient approval process.

App-Assisted Day Reconstruction to Reduce Logistic Toxicity in Cancer The number of new cases of cancer diagnosed in the U.S. was 1.7 million in 2017 and is expected to increase by 35% to 2.3 million in 2030\[1\]. Cancer treatments often create numerous logistic challenges in prioritizing and managing treatment and everyday life priorities and how these challenges affect their everyday lives and well-being (hence "logistic toxicity"). However, there are no established reliable tools to monitor patients' logistic challenges and the associated impacts; and logistic toxicity has been largely unaddressed in cancer care delivery. The objective is to develop the first digital health app for cancer patients to continuously monitor logistic toxicity in their daily lives. The app will combine objective data from mobile sensing with subjective self-reported data to form an app-assisted day reconstruction system that captures activity engagement and well-being information associated with cancer treatment-related activities and trips throughout the day.

Maternal Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy There is general agreement that thyroid gland function should be assessed in pregnant women. When the gland produces too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), all of the woman's bodily functions slow down, and there are problems with her baby's development. Until now, physicians have identified this problem on an individual basis (case-finding), but this approach misses many of the cases. Our trial aims to replace case-finding with a routine blood test that is highly effective at detecting hypothyroidism, thereby allowing treatment to correct the deficiency. This approach can eventually be implemented throughout the United States.

Participants will be randomized to receive this outcome data in one of three formats: as text-only, in a static pictograph, or in an iterative pictograph. Participants will also be randomized to seeing the chance of survival as 30% or 60%.  Participants were then asked to choose between comfort care and intensive care in this situation. Participants' religiosity, value of the sanctity of life, and health literacy were also assessed.
NIH CCR2 AAA Study Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a degenerative vascular disease, which is typically asymptomatic until rupture, resulting in high mortality. AAAs are more prevalent in men over age 65, though rupture is disproportionately higher in women. Due to nonlinear and unpredictable aortic dilatation, it is challenging to predict the AAA rupture using clinical diagnostics based on morphology. No medical therapy is used clinically to treat AAA, and there is an unmet need for clinically translatable, molecular biomarkers of AAA disease activity for surveillance and patient-specific management. The goal of this proposal is to develop a new approach for the diagnosis and targeted therapy of AAA.

Effects of Diet and Exercise on Ductal Carcinoma in Situ This pilot/feasibility trial seeks to explore whether an acute bout of negative energy balance prior to surgery affects biomarkers of neoplasia. Forty overweight or obese postmenopausal women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or early stage breast cancer (Stage I or II) who elect mastectomy or lumpectomy will be randomly assigned to 1-of-2 study arms: 1) an Attention Control Group that receives instruction on dietary approaches to correct nutritional deficiencies and progressive resistance training (PRT) that targets the arm ipsilateral to the affected breast; or 2) an Experimental Group that will receive PRT and guidance to correct nutritional deficiencies plus an intensive intervention to promote a 1.5-2 pound/week weight loss through diet, exercise, and behavior modification. This study will explore and contrast changes in body mass index (BMI) observed from enrollment to the time of surgery in the experimental vs. attention control arms, and also monitor changes in energy intake and physical activity. These changes will be studied in relation to the following endpoints: a) changes in select circulating biomarkers and gene expression related to cancer progression, hormonal status, inflammation and other energy-related factors; b) rates of tumor proliferation and apoptosis; c) tumor markers, e.g., insulin receptor, Vascular Epithelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Nuclear Factor kappa beta (NFkB), and phosphoproteins associated with the Convergence of Hormones, Inflammation and Energy-Rated Factors (CHIEF) pathway; and d) functional and health-related outcomes. Because both tumor tissue and blood will be examined from pre-to-post-intervention, this study will provide exciting new data that can elucidate pathways by which energy balance affects breast cancer progression. Although longer term weight loss is recommended for overweight and obese breast cancer survivors, it is not known whether placing the body in a state of negative energy balance will have a favorable impact on the tumor. If beneficial changes in tumor biology and the host environment occur with short-term, pre-surgical weight loss, this study provides proof of concept that weight loss may offer an acceptable and complementary treatment option that could be combined with standard therapies.

Transfusion of Convalescent Plasma for the Early Treatment of Patients With COVID-19 No specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19 are available. Several therapies, are under investigation, but the antiviral efficacy of these drugs is not yet known. The use of convalescent plasma was recommended as an empirical treatment during outbreaks of Ebola virus in 2014, and a protocol for treatment of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus with convalescent plasma was established in 2015. Accordingly, we hypothesized that use of convalescent plasma transfusion could be beneficial in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.  This is a multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of early use of convalescent plasma in patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.  Primary endpoint will be the efficacy, evaluated as the need of invasive mechanical ventilation defined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio \<150.  Secondary endpoints will be: mortality rates, time to invasive mechanical ventilation, time to virological cure, length of hospital stay, toxicity.  Patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia not requiring mechanical ventilation (both non invasive and invasive) will be randomized 1:1 to receive or not convalescent plasma. Patients in the plasma group will receive 200 ml of convalescent plasma, continuing already administered standard therapy, while patients in the control group will continue to receive the standard therapy. A rescue therapy will be allowed in case of clinical worsening.  Patients will be followed-up until 30 days from randomization.

Improving Prosthetic Provision in Rural Communities: Limb Scanning With Caregiver Assistance When the prosthetic socket of a Veteran with a lower limb amputation no longer fits or is damaged beyond repair, a new prosthetic socket is warranted. The provision of a new socket requires multiple clinical visits which can place a high travel burden and potential pandemic exposure stress on Veterans who live in rural communities far from VA Medical Centers or alternative prosthetic clinics. This research seeks to determine if one of the in-person visits traditionally needed to obtain a well-fitting prosthesis can be performed remotely with the assistance of a helper. The investigators seek to discover if an untrained individual (a helper) can wield inexpensive, easy to use, digital technology to capture the shape of a residual limb to see if it can be used to fabricate a prosthetic socket that fits at least as well as one fabricated by a prosthetist using traditional, hand casting methods in the clinic.  The expected result of this research is an evidence-based prosthetic fabrication process that reduces Veteran travel burden while providing a prosthesis that fits at least as well as the current standard-of-care. The upshot is a clear improvement in prosthetic provision for Veterans, particularly for those who live in rural communities.  To make this determination, the investigators will perform a between-subject experiment with two specific aims. To determine differences in goodness of fit between the two study sockets, the investigators will use both patient reported outcomes, and measurements of the pressure applied to the distal end of the residual limb.  Specific Aim 1: Determine if patient reported outcomes, by subjects wearing a prosthetic socket whose shape was captured with study helper assistance, are at least as good as those reported by subjects wearing a socket whose shape was captured by a prosthetist. The investigators propose to recruit Veterans with a below knee amputation and their study helpers to participate in a human subject experiment. Participants will be randomly assigned and fit with either a prosthesis made with study helper assistance and digital methods, or one made wholly by a prosthetist using traditional methods. Patient reported outcome metrics will be collected while the subject is still wearing their as-prescribed socket at the beginning of the study (baseline), and again after wearing the study prosthesis for two weeks.  Specific Aim 2: Determine if distal end residual limb pressure, measured from a group of individuals fit with a prosthetic socket whose shape was captured with study helper assistance using digital methods, are no worse than those measured from a group of individuals fit with a prosthetic socket whose shape was captured by a prosthetist using traditional methods. Concurrent with the human subject procedures briefly described above, the investigators propose to fabricate duplicates (copies) of the two prosthetic sockets used by each subject in Specific Aim 1. A novel sensor will be embedded in these duplicate sockets which can measure the pressure applied to the distal end of the residual limb. Measurements of distal end residual limb pressure while standing and walking for both the as-prescribed and study sockets will be collected at the beginning of the study (baseline), and again after two weeks.  The data from the investigators' experiments will be used to determine if residual limb shape capture by a helper using digital technologies can be used to make prosthetic sockets that fit at least as well as those made by a prosthetist using traditional, hand casting techniques.  One third of all Veterans live in rural communities far from VA Medical Centers. When Veterans with a lower limb amputation need a new prosthetic socket, attending in-person clinical visits can be a challenge. If the hypotheses are supported, this research will provide evidence to support the use of digital technology as part of clinical practice, enabling a remote, study helper enabled alternative to one of the in-person clinical visits needed to fabricate a well-fitting prosthesis.

Laparoscopy-assisted Ovarian Cystectomy: NEW APPROCH Under general anaesthesia, the patient is placed in the modified dorsal lithotomy position a 10-mm umbilical trocar is inserted. A panoramic view of the pelvis was obtained together with full assessment of the ovarian mass(es).  Aspiration of the cyst:  Veress needle is inserted in the midline 2 cm above the symphysis pubis to aspirate the cyst under laparoscopic guidance (to guide the entry of the needle into the cyst wall \& to confirm complete aspiration).  Delivery of affected ovary outside the abdominal cavity:  Classic ovarian cystectomy will be done using microsurgical techniques in which the cyst wall will be dissected gently and carefully from the healthy ovarian tissue followed by perfect haemostasis and re-fashioning of the remaining ovarian tissue using Vicryl (3-0) sutures.  Re-introduction of the ovary to inside the abdominal cavity:  The stitched ovary is pushed gently inside the abdominal cavity and the mini-laparotomy is re-covered by the rubber shield (to allow re-inflation of the abdominal cavity). The ovary is reassessed under laparoscopic guidance to ensure perfect haemostasis and normal position of the ovary. Pelvic irrigation is done if needed.

Effect of Tyrosine Supplementation on Cognitive Performance and Mood During Military Stress The objective of this research is to determine if tyrosine, an amino acid found in protein-containing foods, will mitigate the cognitive deficits and adverse effects on behavior and mood produced by exposure to military stress. This study was conducted at the US Navy Survive, Evade, Resist, Escape (SERE) school at Brunswick, Maine (ME).  Tyrosine is the dietary precursor of the catecholamine norepinephrine, a key brain neurotransmitter that is critical for the central nervous system (CNS) response to various types of acute stress. Psychological stress increases catecholamine turnover in the brain, increasing the requirement for tyrosine to support synthesis of norepinephrine. Animal and human studies have shown that tyrosine supplementation can produce beneficial effects on cognitive and physiological functions during exposure to a variety of acute stressors.  This project will determine if volunteers treated with supplemental tyrosine during stressful phases of SERE training experience less degradation in cognitive performance and mood than volunteers treated with placebo. Tyrosine or placebo will be administered in a specially developed food bar provided to volunteers. The bar is part of a prototype of ration-component designed for use during assault operations. A between-subjects, double blind experimental design will be employed. Tyrosine, an amino acid found in most protein-containing foods, has been tested in hundreds of volunteers without adverse effects.  Approximately 100 volunteers will be recruited from several SERE classes to ensure up to 80 volunteers complete the study. They will be tested during several portions of SERE. A comprehensive but brief battery of cognitive tests, as well as saliva samples, and heart rate data will be collected in a manner that does not interfere with ongoing training.  Hypotheses:  1. Exposure to the stressors of SERE school will adversely impact cognitive performance and mood of volunteers. 2. The adverse effects of psychological stress on cognitive performance and mood during SERE school will be reduced when volunteers are given supplemental tyrosine compared to placebo treatment.
The Mechanism of Vaginal Flora and Its Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Cervical Cancer The disorder of vaginal microflora and its metabolites is considered to be a facilitating factor to human papillomavirus-mediated cervical cancer. However, the mechanism is still unclear. This study intends to carry out a cross-sectional study and a cohort study. The cross-sectional study intends to recruit 300 premenopausal non-pregnant women, dividing them into five groups, with 60 in each group: HPV negative \[Ctrl HPV (-)\], HPV positive \[Ctrl HPV (+)\], low-grade squamous Intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and newly diagnosed invasive cervical cancer (ICC). Obtain basic information through the questionnaire, and collect vaginal secretion and blood samples. At the same time, patients who are diagnosed with cervical cancer for the first time will be included in the cohort study. Collect the same kind of information. The follow-up period is set to be 3 years, and samples will be collected every six months. If any condition changes within the 3 years, samples should be collected. If new treatments are taken, samples should be taken before and after treatment. And if the lesion turns negative after treatment within the 3 years, complete the follow-up. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metabolomics, and immunological methods to determine the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites and inflammation condition, select biomarkers related to the onset of cervical cancer. construct a cervical cancer risk model and outcome prediction model, and reveal the mechanism of vaginal flora and its metabolites in the pathogenesis and development of cervical cancer. Therefore provides a new direction for the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer.

Study of XL147 (SAR245408) in Combination With Trastuzumab or Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab in Subjects With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Progressed on a Previous Trastuzumab-based Regimen Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.  The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147 may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.
Value of Cardiac Output Monitoring by Supra-sternal Doppler/Echocardiography in Intensive Care Unit The aim of this study is to evaluate the concordance between the measurement of cardiac blood flow by non-invasive supra sternal ultrasound and the measurements performed by invasive monitoring in intensive care patients already equipped with an invasive monitoring. This invasive monitoring consists of catheters used to measure the cardiac output allowing the supply of organs and is installed when there is need to monitor the blood flow in different hemodynamic reasons. The patient's care will not be modified, the study just requires a supplementary measure in an exam already perform in the standard care. The principal hypothesis is that we can show a concordance between this non-invasive measure and the standard invasive monitoring.
Awake VDL Intubation With Dexmedetomidine, a Case Series (DexAwake) Early after the videolaryngoscope'(VDL) introduction in clinical practice, the awake videolaryngoscopic (A-VDL) intubation took place with and instead of the awake video-bronchoscopic (A- VBS) intubation. The awake intubation is a safe profile technique that was underused since the only instrumentation available was the fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) or more recently the video-bronchoscope (VBS). With the VDL diffusion, the awake intubation option has eventually turned into a more utilized procedure, with the potential to become a daily procedure. This was also due to dexmedetomidine (DEX) introduction in The Operating Room pharmacopeia. Several steps must be standardized in order to homogeneously apply an awake intubation protocol. A department protocol is recommended (awake intubation guidelines) but a low threshold for enrollment can be used to shorten and standardize the execution times. This study aims to create a protocol and measure the outcomes.
Efficacy and Safety of Semaglutide Once-weekly Versus Placebo as add-on to SGLT-2i in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and North America. The aim of the trial is to compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once-weekly versus placebo as add-on to sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) monotherapy or in combination with either metformin or sulfonylurea on glycaemic control after 30 weeks of treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects will remain on their pre-trial medication.
Impact of Self-monitoring of Salt Intake by Salt Meter in Hypertensive Patients Hypertension is one of the most common chronic medical conditions. The concerned sequelae are the cardiovascular complications, especially acute myocardial infarction and stroke. In Thailand, the incidence of hypertension is increasing each year. Many clinical studies found that salt intake over the reference level (\>5 g/day) would result in elevated blood pressure (BP) and long-term morbidity. Dietary salt reduction campaigns were unsuccessful, in part, due to time limitation in the clinic, lacking of awareness, and the higher threshold to detect salt taste in chronic high salt ingestion. Salt meter is a device used to detect sodium content in daily food. It will facilitate monitoring and control of salt intake. The 24-hour urinary sodium excretion is an acceptable method to reflect the quantity of sodium intake. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of salt meter plus dietary education compared with education alone in terms of salt intake reduction, blood pressure, salt taste sensitivity, and vascular consequence.

Subjects will be followed for 12 months.
Exercise Training in Women With Heart Disease Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of premature death in Canadian women. Women who suffer an acute coronary event are more likely than men to be physically inactive, have lower exercise capacity, and die in the next year. The standard cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs do not meet women's needs. There is a need to address these issues to increase participation in CR.

Assessment of Endoscopic Tip Control Using a Novel Score Based on the Snare Tip Soft Coagulation of Polypectomy Margin Defects Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer related death with approximately 880 792 deaths every year (9,2% of the global yearly 9.6 million cancer deaths). Screening for polyps is done by colonoscopy, which is considered the gold standard for screening and removal of polyps and has been proven to reduce the global colorectal cancer burden significantly. Endoscopic removal of polyps is preferred because of its efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and safety in comparison to surgery.  Endoscopic tip control is a fundamental component of high quality endoscopy. Endoscopic procedures are complex processes where cognitive processing and motoric output need to be perfectly aligned. This is reflected in endoscopic tip control. It is indispensable in every step of endoscopy: during insertion of the endoscope, where the tip of the endoscope needs to reach the caecum/terminal ileum/duodenum, without discomfort for the patient if under light sedation, during withdrawal of the endoscope in order not to miss any lesions, and also during every endoscopic treatment whether it is a simple polypectomy or a complex therapeutic procedure performed by expert endoscopists.  However, there is currently no tool available to assess endoscopic tip control. And very little is known about educating it.  The investigators developed a new, web-based scoring system to assess tip control. The intent of this study is to validate this novel tool so it can be used to assess endoscopists and evaluate their progress when training in endoscopy.  This study takes place at the University Hospital Ghent, which is a tertiary care center for gastrointestinal endoscopy. The investigators will validate the tool in this study, through assessment of endoscopists of varying experience while they use a technique of snare tip soft coagulation on the margin of a polypectomy defect. This technique has proven its use in preventing recurrence after polypectomy. The technique uses the tip of a snare (used to resect polyps) to deliver thermal energy to the margin of a polypectomy, also called margin ablation. Thermal energy is applied by a hit on a pedal (operated with the foot), every hit needs to be exactly on the margin of the defect (not in the defect, not on normal mucosa around the defect). This requires a very steady and controlled handling of the endoscope and is an ideal technique to assess endoscopist's tip control. The score system will calculate the accuracy (number of correct hits over number of wrong hits) of tip control per second.
Effect of Metformin on Insulin Sensitivity and Pan-Arterial Vascular Function in Adults With Metabolic Syndrome The purpose of this study is to look at how insulin (a hormone that helps the cells get energy from sugar) in our body affects blood vessels (elasticity in the bigger blood vessels and blood flow in the smaller blood vessels in the arm) and how Metformin (a drug that makes you more sensitive to insulin) affects insulin's action on the blood vessels.
Culturally Congruent HIV Risk Reduction App for Young Women, an Acceptability & Pilot Evaluation Smartphone applications and mobile technologies offer users the potential to access critical information (e.g., proper condom use, directions to testing sites, and other sexual and reproductive health services) when it is needed most. Relevant findings will identify areas where existing interventions may be leveraged and adapted to work among young women of color in an urban setting and their networks. As SRH smartphone apps continue to proliferate, this study will expand researchers', developers', and health educators' limited knowledge about the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a sexual health educational app tailored with and for young Black and Latino women, aged 18-25 in NYC, including whether this app acts as a gateway to sexual health educators, clinical and other service providers. If proven effective, findings from this study will identify areas where existing interventions may be leveraged and adapted to work among a YBLW and their networks, and potentially adapted for other high needs communities.
Will Cleaning the Bowel With an Enema Before Vaginal Prolapse Surgery Prevent Complications? Traditionally, many gynecologic surgeons have asked patients to perform a cleansing enema the night before a vaginal surgery done to repair pelvic organ prolapse (dropped bladder, dropped uterus). The belief is that there is then less or no stool present at the vaginal incision and less chance of infection of the wound by bowel bacteria. However, not all surgeons follow this practice. There is no evidence in the medical literature if one way is better than the other. In this study, patients scheduled for vaginal surgery to correct prolapse will be randomly assigned to perform an enema or not to perform an enema.

A Randomised Comparison Between Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy and Standard Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been established as the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstone disease. The main advantages of laparoscopic surgery are the cosmetic result, reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and rapid return to normal activity. Although reduced, however, pain is still substantial and constitutes the main clinical problem after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially for planned day case procedures.  Recently, a new technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been developed, in which all instruments are inserted through the same umbilical incision. The single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique for cholecystectomy has been proved to be feasible and safe by several studies.  The purpose of the study is to compare postoperative pain and operating time, nausea, vomiting, tissue damage, pulmonary function, cosmetic result, quality of life between SILS and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

HBV-host cfDNA as Minimal Residual Tumor Marker for HBV-related HCC Early stage HCC is treated by curative surgical resection or by local ablation (such as radio-frequency) as the current standard of care. The complete removal of clinical visible HCC is then confirmed by imaging by MRI or CT, or by a decline of tumor marker (AFP or PIVKA). However, despite an apparent complete removal of the HCC, those post-curative patients frequently develop tumor recurrence at a rate ranging 10-50% within the first year. The high rate of early HCC recurrence indicated a minimal residual HCC after the curative therapies in a significant proportion of patients. A better and more specific biomarker for detecting the residual HCC will improve the patients' prognosis prediction and therapeutic plan.  To detect the minimal residual HCC, a biomarker unique to the tumor is needed. Currently, the cell-free circulating DNA carrying tumor-specific somatic mutations has been advocated as a promising one. It has been applied to investigate the tumor responses or resistances to cancer therapy. However, currently it is restricted to detect or follow only large advanced cancer, because of the difficulty in separating or enriching the cfDNA with tumor-specific mutations from the cfDNA from normal cells. In this project, the investigators proposed that one class of somatic mutation in HBV-related HCC, namely the insertion mutagenesis by integrated HBV DNA, could be adopted to circumvent this difficulty. HBV DNA integration has been found in the chromosomes of about 90% of HBV-related HCC and the integration site is unique to individual HCC. The HBV-host junction DNA fragment from one HCC is therefore a tumor-specific biomarker. Such fragments can be released into the circulation as cell-free circulating DNAs, and the detection of the HBV-host chimera DNAs in the circulation is a reliable evidence for the presence of the tumor in the patient. Therefore the cf circulating HBV-host chimera DNA is proposed to assay any minimal residual HCC after curative therapies.

This study aimed to investigate prevalence of poor sleep quality in IBD and association with disease activity by subjective and objective measures.  Prospective observational study is conducted with expected sample size of 100 patients. Participants are classified into active and inactive disease status according to standard IBD severity assessment measures. Demographic data, disease activity, quality of life, sleep questionnaire (validated PSQI questionaire), and seven-day sleep data acquired from ambulatory wrist actigraphy were obtained. Association between sleep quality and disease activity will be analyzed.
Morphological and Serological Criteria of Plaque Vulnerability: Risk Assessment for Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis The aim of this study is to investigate the association of sonographic and histological features of the plaque among each other and with biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. The predictive value of these factors concerning the long-term clinical outcome after carotid endarterectomy will also be assessed. This may help to improve the identification of patients with carotid artery stenosis who will benefit most from carotid endarterectomy. The investigators major hypothesis is that the morphology of carotid plaques is associated with objectifiable sonographic parameters, in particular with the greyscale median. Second, the investigators hypothesize that sonographic and histological plaque morphology are associated with certain biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Identification of 'vulnerable plaques' on the basis of a peripheral blood draw and a sonographic investigation may enable the treating physician to focus resources on patients who will benefit most form therapeutic interventions for primary prevention of ischemic stroke.

Paracetamol Absorption Technique as a Method for Measuring Gastric Tube Outlet Retention of the gastric tube after esophagectomy is a clinically important problem, and there is a need of a simple method to evaluate emptying rate from the gastric tube after esophagectomy. Scintigraphy is the golden standard of measuring emptying rate from the gastric tube. In non-operated patients, paracetamol clearance technique have been widely used for measuring gastric emptying rate. There is no validation however if paracetamol clearance technique can be used for measuring emptying rate of the gastric tube. The investigators aim of this pilot- study is to validate paracetamol clearance technique to scintigraphy for measuring emptying rate from the gastric tube and to evaluate if there is a correlation between symptoms of retention and quality of life with the emptying rate.
FLuoresence Image Guided Surgery With A VEGF-targeted Tracer in Soft-tissue Sarcomas in Humans Approach With Bevacizumab-IRDye 800CW There is a need for better visualization of resection margins during surgery for soft tissue sarcoma. Optical molecular imaging of soft tissue sarcoma associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarker Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in soft tissue sarcoma versus normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. VEGF-A can be targeted by the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies can be labeled by the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye IRDye800CW (800CW). The investigators hypothesize that bevacizumab-800CW accumulates in VEGF expressing cancer, enabling soft tissue sarcoma visualization using a NIR intraoperative camera system. In this pilot intervention study the investigators will determine the optimal dosage of bevacizumab-800CW (10, 25 or 50mg) to detect soft tissue sarcoma intraoperatively.

The time to recurrence ,the overall survival as well as the incidence of complications after therapy was observed to confirm the role of adjuvant TACE.
A Comparison of Intranasal Midazolam and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Minimal Sedation for Minor Procedures in a Pediatric Emergency Department The objective of this project is to compare the sedative effects of intranasal midazolam versus inhaled nitrous oxide (N2O) for minor procedures in the pediatric emergency department. The primary outcome will be length of stay (LOS) in the emergency department (ED) stay for minor procedures. Secondarily the investigators will compare patient/family and provider satisfaction while using either intranasal midazolam or N2O for minimal sedation. The investigators hypothesize that the total length of stay for children undergoing minor procedures in the ED will be lower for N2O, as compared to intranasal midazolam. The investigators also hypothesize that patient/family and provider satisfaction will be higher with N2O and adverse effects will not differ between N2O and intranasal midazolam. Patients will receive either intranasal midazolam or N2O for minor procedures. Following the enrollment period, data will be analyzed and the two will be compared. Total length of stay, patient/family and provider satisfaction will be studied.

Brief Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia Versus Sleep Hygiene for Sleep Difficulties in Early Pregnancy Pregnant and postpartum individuals often have difficulty sleeping and these sleep problems can negatively impact both the parent and infant. Research suggests that pregnant individuals prefer non-medication-based treatment for their sleep difficulties but there is a lack of research on the success of sleep treatment during pregnancy. Currently, there are two main non-medical treatments for sleep difficulties available. The first, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), is the first treatment recommended for insomnia and has been found to successfully treat insomnia during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, shortened sessions of CBT for insomnia have also been found to successfully reduce sleep difficulties. The second option is sleep hygiene education which is the most commonly offered treatment for sleep difficulties and has been found to improve sleep problems. The present study will compare the effectiveness of a CBT for insomnia group workshop to a Sleep Hygiene group workshop.

Ahmed Valve Implantation Coated With Poly Lactic -Co-glycolic Acid (PLGA) Saturated With Mitomycin-C in the Management of Adult Onset Glaucoma in Sturge Weber Syndrome Sturge weber's syndrome is an oculcutaneous syndrome, ocular manifestations may include heamangioma in the eye lids, choroidal heamangioma, or glaucoma, the glaucoma may present at infancy and may be due to resistance to aqueous outflow through trabecular meshwork(1), it may develop later and this is due to episcleral venous raised pressure.(2-3) Glaucoma associated with Sturge weber syndrome is difficult to be treated medically with high risk of complications when treated with bleb -based surgeries. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage or detachment is a challenging complication which must be encountered.  The usage of Ahmed valve in the management of glaucoma associated with Sturge weber syndrome is a bleb based procedure carries the risks of over filtration or encapsulation and decreased filtration with failure to control glaucoma.  The use of Ahmed valve in the management of pediatric glaucoma associated with Sturge weber syndrome has better results as recorded by Nassiri et al. Ahmed valve implantation can have some drawbacks such as pupillary irregularity, lens opacification, or encapsulation.(4-7) Glaucoma drainage devices such as Ahmed valve, Molteno or Braeveldt valve can be used when other methods of treatment fail, they provide alternative pathway to the aqueous to be collected in a plate positioned under the conjunctiva, (8-10) Encapsulation is a major problem occurs around the end plate due to fibrous reaction and so the drainage of the aqueous is decreased , Epatein (11) attributed that to fibro vascular proliferation in the episcleral tissue .the fibrous reaction is multifactorial , it may be due to the size of the end plate, the biomaterial, design or the shape of the plate.  The use of drainage devices with advanced drug delivery system can improve the success of drainage device.  A double-layered porous coating for Ahmed glaucoma valves based on biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) was described by Ponnusamy et al. \[12\] to produce continuous release of antifibrotic agents \[mitomycin C (MMC) and/or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\] to the subconjunctival space. This release continue for about one month with decreasing fibrosis, the nanofiltration membrane could entrap the proteins passing out from the anterior chamber leading to minimal increase in aqueous resistance.(12-13)

Targeting of UnControlled Hypertension in Emergency Department The proposed project underscores the following: 1) The prevalence of uncontrolled/undiagnosed hypertension (HTN) in underrepresented groups presenting to the ED is alarmingly high, and 2) ED engagement and early risk assessment/stratification is a cost-effective, feasible innovation to help close health disparity gaps in HTN. This proposal involves a two-arm randomized controlled trial of up to 770 patients from the Emergency Department at University of Illinois Hospital with elevated blood pressure (BP). The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of an emergency department-initiated Educational and Empowerment (E2) intervention with a Post Acute Care Hypertension Consultation (PACHT-c) intervention (arm 2) on the primary outcome of mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) differences between the two trial arms at 6-months post intervention. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effectiveness of this ED education and empowerment intervention on mean SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) differences at 3-months, and mean DBP differences at 6-months. Additionally improvement in cardiovascular risk score (as measured by the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Score), primary care engagement (measured by compliance with outpatient follow-up appointments), and HTN knowledge improvement (as measured by a validated HTN knowledge survey).

Direct Repair Surgery for Spondylolysis of Lumbar in Young Population Lumbar spondylolysis is a relatively common condition that causes severe and perennial back pain in young populations. Conservative treatment of this condition may be futile, and may eventually require surgical treatment such as direct repair of pars defect and a segmental lumbar fusion with an anterior or posterior approach. Recently, of surgical treatment methods for spondylolysis, direct repair surgery of pars defect has been focused due to its inherited strengths. Most importantly, fusion surgery caused the affected segment to lose the nature range of motion and furthermore adjacent segment to be adversely affecting such as adjacent disc disease or degeneration, while direct repair theoretically could preserve the motion of the affected segment, which do not cause the adjacent segment problems as being the fusion surgery, as well as could produce better surgical outcomes with relatively less invasive technique as compared to fusion surgery. Moreover, previous articles have demonstrated that the direct repair surgery for spondylolysis of lumbar spine could achieve great functional and radiological outcomes. However, most of the previous studies was conducted using lower level designed study such as retrospective and small sample size, thereby prior literature does not provide clear information on the therapeutic outcome of direct repair for lumbar spondylolysis, especially for managing spondylolysis of young population.  Therefore, The investigators aimed to evaluate and determine the outcomes of direct repair surgery for lumbar spondylolysis in young population. To our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the functional and radiological outcomes of direct repair for spondylolysis in young populations with prospective cohort study design and relatively large sample size.
MRI Study of Brain Activity and Risk for Depression in Adolescents Anxiety in children of parents with major depressive disorder (MDD) poses a particularly high risk for later-life MDD. In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in prefrontal brain regions that regulate attention to emotional stimuli. These abnormalities: i) have been found primarily in adults with specific familial forms of MDD; ii) persist after recovery from MDD, and iii) relate to anxiety. These findings raise the possibility that risk for MDD is tied to dysfunction in prefrontal regions involved in regulation of emotion, which possibly manifests as early-life anxiety. If this possibility were confirmed in never-depressed adolescents at high risk for MDD, the findings would provide key insights into the developmental neurobiology of MDD. The goal of this protocol is to study the neural substrate of risk for MDD in young people. This protocol tests the hypothesis that adolescents at high risk for MDD by virtue of childhood anxiety and parental history of MDD exhibit dysfunction in prefrontal cortex and amygdala, regions involved in emotion regulation. This goal will be accomplished through fMRI studies of emotion regulation in high and low-risk adolescents.  For this research, at-risk adolescents will be recruited from participants in an NIMH-funded extramural study at New York University (NYU) examining the biology of risk for anxiety and depressive disorders. Over a three-year period, 45 high-risk probands and 60 low-risk comparisons will be studied, including 20 comparisons from the NYU sample and 40 from the Washington DC metropolitan area. In the present protocol, to be conducted at NIH, subjects will undergo volumetric MRI scans to assess structural abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe. They will complete a series of four out-of-scanner cognitive tasks and two fMRI-based cognitive tasks that measure modulation of attention to emotional stimuli. The fMRI tasks are hypothesized to differentially engage the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in low vs. high risk subjects. These tasks will be used to test the hypothesis that at-risk individuals exhibit enhanced amygdala and reduced prefrontal activation on the fMRI emotion/attention tasks.
Study on the Current Situation and Related Factors of Hypertension Management in a Poor County in Shanxi Province This project aims to understand the current situation of hypertension management in a poor county in Shanxi Province, and explore the factors that affect patients' blood pressure control based on local reality, and provide a basis for further promoting the standardized management of hypertension in poor areas and the comprehensive prevention and control of chronic diseases at the national grassroots level.
Spine Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Metastatic Epidural Spinal Cord Compression Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a frequent oncologic emergency that requires to be treated promptly. Although direct decompressive surgery is the most effective treatment, surgery is only used in selected patients because most patients have a poor overall condition and short life expectancy. Radiation therapy (RT), therefore, is the most commonly used for patients with MESCC, but conventional RT alone can achieve modest neurologic outcomes.  The hypothesis to use stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for MESCC is that the rapid decompression of epidural mass, durable local control and subsequently improved neurologic outcomes compared to conventional RT are expected when MESCC is treated with SBRT.
Inhibiting COMT in Parkinson's Disease The overall aim of this observational study is to investigate the impact of COMT inhibition on homocysteine metabolism, vascular physiology and correlates of neurodegeneration in PD patients with certain COMT genotype.

The Effect on Thirst, Nausea-Vomiting and Comfort Levels of Menthol Lozenge Applied After Extubation It is reported that approximately 17.5 million people die worldwide each year due to cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and rheumatic heart disease. The most preferred method in the treatment of coronary artery disease is Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. This procedure routinely requires general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Patients due to these practices often experience nausea-vomiting and thirst after extubation. It is stated that menthol application, which is a low cost, easy to apply and safe method, can be effective in the management of these complications. As a result of the literature review, there is no study evaluating the effectiveness of the menthol lozenge in quenching thirst after extubation and in the management of nausea and vomiting. In this study, it is aimed to develop methods that accelerate the postoperative recovery by proving the effect of oral menthol lozenge intake after extubation on thirst, nausea-vomiting, physiological parameters and comfort level in patients undergoing CABG surgery. The universe of this randomized controlled study was planned by Dr. Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Training and Research Hospital will create patients who underwent CABG surgery. His sample, on the same dates, was Dr. Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Training and Research Hospital will create a total of 118 patients hospitalized in the Cardiovascular Surgery (Postoperative) Intensive Care Unit and undergoing CABG surgery that meet the inclusion criteria. Participants will be divided into two equal groups as intervention (n = 59) and control (n = 59) groups. Patient Information Form, Intraoperative Patient Evaluation Form, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for evaluation of thirst and nausea-vomiting, Physiological Parameter Control Form, Analgesic-Antiemetic Use Control Form, General Comfort Scale Short Form will be used for data collection. The intervention group will be given a lozenge containing menthol orally at the 30th, 60th and 90th minutes after extubation. Thirst, nausea-vomiting, physiological parameters, analgesic and antiemetic consumption and comfort levels of all patients will be evaluated. The data obtained from the study will be analyzed with appropriate statistical methods using the SPSS for Windows 22.0 program (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).

Phase 1 Pilot Study of 4-MP to Treat Stargardt Macular Dystrophy The purpose of this study is to investigate whether taking 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP, fomepizole, Antizol™) inhibits dark adaptation of the eye. In other words, we are testing if 4-MP slows the processing of vitamin A derivatives in the eye. By slowing down these processes, individuals with Stargardt disease may have better chances of saving their remaining vision. 4-MP has been shown to slow dark adaptation in animals, and is FDA approved for human use to treat individuals with methanol or ethylene glycol (antifreeze) poisoning by shutting down the body's ability to process alcohols. This medication has an excellent safety profile and has been reported to have no short-term or long-term side effects, as long as patients refrain from any alcohol while the medication is in the body. A single dose of 4-MP remains in the body for about 12 hours, and therefore, it may inhibit dark adaptation of your eyes for up to 12 hours. Studying the effects of 4-MP may lead to effective medical treatment to save Stargardt patients' vision, and may also have similar effects in other macular degenerative diseases.

Effects of a Myofascial Technique on Biomechanical Properties of the Lumbar Myofascia of Chronic Low Back Pain Adults Non-specific low back pain is a worldwide health issue that remains poorly understood. Some authors have shown that the thoracolumbar fascia of low back pain adults presents changes in biomechanical properties. As it is richly endowed with pain receptors, the thoracolumbar fascia could therefore be a key contributor to this chronic pain condition. Myofascial techniques (MFTs) are commonly used in manual therapy by practitioners of various backgrounds to address fascia biomechanical properties, but there is a paucity of objective evidence on their effects on tissue state. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography, sonoelastography and myometry are emerging imaging techniques that can quantify the biomechanical properties of fascia and underlying muscle. These innovative techniques could in turn contribute to a better understanding of MFTs effects on fascial properties.  The main objective of this study is to evaluate the immediate effect of a standardized MFT on the elastography features of the lumbar paraspinal muscle and fascia (i.e. myofascial unit). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the immediate effects of a MFT on: i) ultrasonography features of the myofascial unit; ii) myometry features of the myofascial unit; ii) pain intensity.

Health Coaching to Improve Self-Management in Thoracic Transplant Candidates Ability to adhere to complex medical regimens is critical to achieving successful transplant outcomes, as non-adherent patients suffer graft failure and death following transplantation. Since potential recipients greatly exceed organ availability, identification of candidates who will adhere to complex post-transplant regimens is critically important and emphasized by practice guidelines. When selecting candidates for transplant, physicians try to subjectively predict post-transplant adherence because, although tools exist to measure current adherence, tools that reliably predict future adherence are lacking. Despite rigorous medical and psychosocial screening pretransplant, non-adherence rates are high following transplant. Therefore, the current approach for predicting future non-adherence is suboptimal, subjective, and greatly needs strategies for improvement.  Pre-transplant self-management abilities represent a marker of future adherence post-transplant. Assessing self-management as a means for predicting future adherence has been largely overlooked. Self-management is defined as "taking responsibility for one's own behavior and well-being" and consists of three management tasks: medical condition, emotions, and social roles. Self-management ability can be measured. However, self-management has not been systematically studied in heart and lung transplant patients. Fostering self-management abilities may improve post-transplant outcomes by optimizing not only adherence, but also proven pretransplant risk factors (e.g. frailty and obesity).Self-management abilities may be improved via behavioral interventions such as health coaching.Self-management represents a measurable criterion that could be utilized in pre-transplant screening and serve as a point of intervention for optimizing adherence and pre-transplant risk factors.The overall objective of the proposed research is to improve the knowledge gap regarding self-management (and thereby adherence) in transplant by qualitatively and quantitatively studying patient factors associated with self-management and testing an intervention that may improve self-management.  The investigators hypothesize: Individualized health coaching including strategies to address poor resilience, coping with uncertainty, frailty, and/or negative affect will be an effective therapeutic strategy at improving self-management while in the pre-transplant state.  Specific Aim: To test whether transplant candidates who receive pre transplant health coaching have greater improvement in self-management abilities.  The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled pilot trial testing the effectiveness of health coaching versus usual care in a heart and lung transplant cohort on self-management abilities (SMAS-30).

The Use of Compression Bandages in Total Knee Replacement Surgery The use of compression bandages in elective orthopaedic knee surgery is well regarded, however, there is a lack of robust, well-designed evidence to support this.  The aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised control trial comparing the use of a compression bandage worn post-operatively for 24 hours after elective total knee replacement, compared to standard practice (wool and crepe, non-compressive dressing).
Descriptive Study on the Evaluation of Well-being in Relation to Diet and Nutrition and Comparison Between Three Care Units in the Dijon University Hospital Centre The aim of this study is to qualify patient well-being in relation to diet. The notion of dietary well-being is believed to be subjective and we wish to base it on tangible parameters (presentation of meals, variety of menus, social interaction, environment, convenience, pleasure...) in order to establish a score of dietary well-being that we will then correlate to the patient's nutritional status. This tool can then be used more widely as an assessment tool within health institutions.

Multimodal Exploration of Patients With Multiple Sclerosis for an Early Detection of Subtle Progression Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by a complex interplay of inflammatory demyelination and neuronal damage. The core MS phenotypes defined by clinical course are the relapsing and the progressive forms.Relapsing MS (RMS) is characterized by attacks - also called relapses - defined as new or increasing neurologic dysfunction, followed by periods of partial or complete recovery, without apparent progression of the disease during the periods of remission. In contrast, progressive MS (PMS) is characterized by progressive worsening of neurologic function leading to accumulation of disability over time independent of relapses. Additional descriptors ("active/not-active") serve to better characterize the presence of clinical and/or radiological activity both in relapsing and progressive forms.  In recent years, the concept of a silent progression, also known as smouldering MS, is making its way into the common lexicon of MS experts, challenging the current definitions of MS phenotypes. A growing body of literature suggests that the line between RMS and PMS is not as marked as men thought, and that inflammation and neurodegeneration can represent a single disease continuum coexisting early on in the disease course. Whilst it is established that relapse-associated worsening (RAW) can be accounted for by an acute inflammatory focal damage leading to axonal transection and conduction block, the physiopathology underlying the progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) remains unclear.  It is becoming apparent that there is an increasing need for a personalized therapeutic approach by considering the individual MS phenotype of each patient, thereby enabling the choice of the molecule best suited to counteract the predominant disease pattern of that individual patient.  There is a limited number of studies combining clinical scores, neurophysiological evaluation and neuroimaging in patients with MS experiencing PIRA. Integrating a multimodal exploration of these patients might allow a step forward in the early recognition, management, and treatment of disability accumulation independent from relapses in patients with MS.
National Psoriasis Foundation - Dendritic Cell-Specific Transmembrane Protein (DC-Stamp) Biomarker Study The purpose of this study is to determine whether DC-STAMP, a protein on the surface of osteoclast precursors (OCPs), can be used as a biologic marker in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).

Biological therapies, such as therapeutic autologous lymphocytes, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Giving therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together with aldesleukin may kill more cancer cells
Fatty Acid Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity After Exercise in Obesity Alterations in fatty acid mobilization and oxidation may be primary adaptations responsible for the improvements in metabolic health after a single session of endurance exercise. The investigators will determine the effect of a single session of endurance exercise on whole-body fatty acid mobilization and oxidation, IMTG concentration and the expression of factors that regulate these processes in skeletal muscle of 11 women with abdominal obesity (age: 18-45y). In addition, the investigators will evaluate how these factors, and exercise, effect insulin signalling and insulin sensitivity. Every effort will be made to recruit subjects from ethnic and minority groups. Before participating in the study, subjects will be informed of all the procedures and potential risks, and they will sign an informed consent form approved by The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. Eligible volunteers will participate in three separate trials, in a randomized order. In two trials subjects will eat exactly the same amount of calories, except in one trial they will exercise (eucaloric + exercise) and in the other trial they will remain sedentary (hypercaloric). In a third trial subjects will again remain sedentary but instead they will ingest appropriate calories to maintain caloric balance (eucaloric + sedentary). By doing this the investigators are also able to investigate the effect of acute caloric perturbations on insulin sensitivity, because it is possible that the enhanced insulin sensitivity evident after exercise, as compared to the sedentary state, is due to caloric deficit and not the exercise bout, per se.
Smog Induced Indoor Air Pollution in Homes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients. Primary objective of this project is to measure the impact of passive control and active control systems on indoor pollution that is directly or indirectly related to ambient air pollution (smog). The first goal will be to measure baseline parameters for 50 homes, including information about the building, ventilation characteristics, pollution levels (indoors and outdoors), and occupant survey information. In a subset of these homes, either passive or active control systems will be installed and the impact of these systems on indoor concentrations. Participants will be enrolled on a rolling basis (5-15 persons studied at a given point in time) over a 16-month period. Participants will be followed for approximately 5 weeks and data obtained at three points in time: at enrollment (day 1 of study), after 1 week (baseline verification) and after four weeks with the control system in the home (at the end of study week 5).

"Fit For Kids"-Copenhagen This study aims to evaluate the effect of a 40- week multifactorial intervention against overweight, obesity and physical inactivity in Danish children.  The investigators wish to examine 40 children before and after the "Fit for Kids" intervention with basic anthropometric measures such as body mass indexi (BMI), waist/hip ratio, systolic- and diastolic blood pressure, level of physical fitness and Total Body fat mass.  Furthermore the investigators wish to examine the more specific inflammatory, metabolic and hormonal effect of the intervention with a more extensive examination programme.  The tests include a DXA-scan, cardio-respiratory fitness, accelerometer monitoring, pedometer monitoring, cognitive testing, Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, different metabolic and inflammatory markers and an oral glucose tolerance test. The study will take place at Centre of Inflammation and Metabolism, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.  The study is a randomised controlled trial with a gradual rollout. The 40 children will be randomised. Twenty children will start the intervention at baseline and 20 children will start after the first 20 weeks of intervention, thus providing a control group.  The investigators expect to find a significant reduction in BMI, total body fat mass and systolic blood pressure after the intervention. As for the more extensive tests, the data approach is explorative, as the investigators look at more statistical dependent variables. The contribution of this project is a further description on the effect of intervention against overweight and physical inactivity on the metabolic and inflammatory response.
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Initiation Time in Acute Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) is recommended for symptomatic patients within 24 h of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. However, previous major studies found significantly better outcomes with HBO2 in patients treated within 6 h. Currently, there is no consensus on a CO poisoning-to-HBO2 interval that would not be beneficial.  Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the difference in therapeutic effect depending on the poisoning-to-HBO2 interval after CO exposure in patients with acute CO poisoning who received HBO2 within 24 h. The investigators compared the neurocognitive outcomes of patients according to HBO2 time intervals based on the outcomes of patients treated within 6 h (control group) with propensity score matching using the CO poisoning registry of our hospital.

Endothelial Dysfunction and Oxidative Stress in Children With Sleep Disordered Breathing. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disease in both adults and children and is caused by the obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Unlike adults, most cases of paediatric SDB are due to the presence of enlarged tonsils and adenoids, thus the main treatment option is adenotonsillectomy (AT). It is well known that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in adults increases the risk for hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke, and there is now mounting evidence that SDB also has a significant impact on the cardiovascular system in children with reports of elevated blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction and altered autonomic cardiovascular control.  Oxidative stress seems to play a pivotal role in impairing flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and consequently enhancing cardiovascular risk in SDB patients but the underlying mechanism is still undefined.  Previously, we demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction is directly related to NADPH oxidase activation. Furthermore, recently we assessed the association between OSA, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in adults showing that increased NADPH oxidase-generated oxidative stress and arterial dysfunction are partially reversed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment.  There is evidence in literature that cardiovascular morbidities associated with SDB are potentially reversible in children; AT may have a significant role in reversing the cardiovascular sequelae of SDB (e.g. children with OSA).  Nowadays, there aren't studies that analyzed the role of NADPH oxidase-generated oxidative stress in SDB children.  The purpose of the current research project is to examine the role of NADPH oxidase activity, oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial function in SDB children, understanding the mechanisms involved in this disease.  Furthermore we will analyse the effect of a AT on inflammation, oxidative stress, NADPH oxidase activity and endothelial function in SDB children.
A Pilot Study of the Effects of Isotretinoin on Cognition, Learning and Memory This prospective study tested the effects of isotretinoin in a cohort of patients receiving standard therapy for acne vulgaris.

Management of Allergic Rhinitis Patients With Nasal Steroids and NeilMed® Sinus Rinse™ System With Isotonic Saline You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. You are being asked to participate in this study because you have completed at least one month of drug treatment with a nasal steroid and allergy testing and still have symptoms. This research study is sponsored by NeilMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The purpose of this study is to compare quality of life outcomes in patients who continue medical treatment plus the use of the NeilMed Sinus Rinse low-pressure pump with saline. Your participation in this study may help to improve the management of patients with allergic rhinitis.  Allergic rhinitis is a common health problem, affecting between 10% and 40% of the world's population. Presently, antihistamines and nasal steroids are the standard treatment for allergic rhinitis. To further clarify these findings, we propose a study comparing the differences in quality of life improvements, by using a series of questionnaires, between subjects electing continued medical management and those electing medical treatment plus nasal wash.  The investigators in charge of the study are Dr. Rodney J. Schlosser and Dr. Shaun A. Nguyen. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled in this study at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC Hospital). You will have the choice of choosing either to receive only medical treatment or to receive medical treatment with nasal wash.

Three Dimension Laparoscopic Versus Open Surgery for Gallbladder Carcinoma Introduction: Surgery is the only potential curative approach for the highly lethal gallbladder carcinoma. The laparoscopic surgery has developed rapidly since invented. As a kind of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy including segmentg IVB and V is preferred by most of surgeons. There have been studies comparing intraoperative blood loss, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and costs of laparoscopic cholecystectomy over open surgery. However, randomized controlled trials are still lacking but clearly required to reveal whether the laparoscopic approach or the open surgery is the better option for treating gallbladder carcinoma. We hypothesize that incidence of postoperative complications is lower, and time to functional recovery is shorter after laparosopic compared with open approach, even in an enhanced recovery setting.  Methods/design: We designed this prospective, randomized, controlled trial with two treatment approaches, laparoscopic versus open surgery for gallbladder carcinoma. The trial hypothesis is that laparoscopic approach has advantages in postoperative recoveries and be equivalent in operation time, oncological results and long-term follow-up compared with open counterpart. The duration of the entire trial is four years including prearrangement, follow-up and analyses.  Discussion: Although several studies have discussed different surgical approaches for gallbladder carcinoma treatment, this trial will be a thorough RCT comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for gallbladder carcinoma.
Open-Label Phase 2 Trial of a Steroid-Free, CNI-Free, Belatacept-Based Immunosuppressive Regimen The primary objective is to evaluate a NULOJIX® (belatacept) based regimens as a means of improving long-term graft function without increasing the risks of immunologic graft injury by avoiding both calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and corticosteroids.
Genomic Structural Variation in Cancer Susceptibility This study will look for new types of gene changes that may be related to cancer in some patients. Some gene changes (mutations) are passed on from parents to offspring (child). Other gene changes are new and are seen for the first time in a child. They are not seen in the parent.  Some of these gene changes may cause cancers in the offspring. We will look for gene changes by studying patients with cancer their parents and family members without cancer. In this study, we will be able to find gene changes that occur in the cancer patient but not in the rest of the family. Knowing the role that new gene changes play in cancer risk may help us find people at a higher risk of getting cancer.
Testing the Effectiveness of Telephone Support for Dementia Caregivers The primary goal of the study is documentation of effectiveness of telephone support groups to reduce caregiver burden and stress. Caregivers who participate in intervention (Telephone Support) should experience lower levels of stress, burden and health care utilization (lower use of psychotropic drugs, fewer scheduled/unscheduled medical visits, lower rates of institutionalization, more efficient use of time in managing care recipient problems) compared to those caregivers in Usual Care.
Needle Stick Injuries in Emergency Medical Service Practice During the pandemic era, medical personnel should wear full protective suits. However, they limit the performance of medical procedures.

Cetuximab, Combination Chemotherapy, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III or Stage IV Head and Neck Cancer That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high energy x- rays to kill tumor cells. Cetuximab may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known which regimen of radiation therapy, combination chemotherapy, and cetuximab and is most effective in treating patients with head and neck cancer.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is comparing two different regimens of radiation therapy given together with combination chemotherapy and cetuximab to see how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.
SOD1 Kinetics Measurements in ALS Patients Washington University in St. Louis is seeking participants with ALS for a study to determine the half-life of the protein SOD1 in the cerebral spinal fluid. Mutations in the SOD1 gene are known to cause some forms of familial ALS. Researchers are developing a treatment to reduce the level of SOD1 in familial ALS, but need to know more about how long SOD1 stays in the body ("half-life") to help determine if the new treatment is effective.
Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI): The Effectiveness of Physical Therapy The treatment of femoroacetabular impingement has evolved over the last several years. As the number of arthroscopic hip operations has risen over the last few years, so has the level controversy in regards to the appropriate initial management. There have been many recent advances in clinical diagnosis, advanced imaging techniques, improved indications for surgery and improved arthroscopic techniques which have led to improved clinical outcomes, but the effectiveness of physical therapy remains unknown.
Effects of Brain Stimulation on Higher-Order Cognition The purpose of this study is to better understand the neural correlates of higher-order cognition, both in the healthy brain and in schizophrenia, and to determine how these mechanisms are modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at frontal and occipital scalp sites. Testing the effects of tDCS at these scalp sites on cognitive task performance will help us understand the roles of the brain regions corresponding to these sites during higher-order cognitive processing (language comprehension, cognitive control, and related attention and memory processes). Behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) measures will be used to assess cognitive performance. The investigator's overarching hypothesis is that stimulating prefrontal circuits with tDCS can improve cognitive control performance, and ultimately performance on a range of cognitive tasks, as compared to stimulating a different cortical region (occipital cortex) or using sham stimulation. This study is solely intended as basic research in order to understand brain function in healthy individuals and individuals with schizophrenia. This study is not intended to diagnose, cure or treat schizophrenia or any other disease.
Tailored Therapy for Clarithromycin-Resistant H. Pylori Clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori is the main cause of H. pylori eradication failure.

A Multi-professional Team Intervention on Physical Activity Referrals in Primary Care Patients With Cardiovascular Risk Factors-the Dalby Lifestyle Intervention Cohort (DALICO) Study Background The present study protocol describes the trial design of a primary care intervention cohort study, which examines whether an extended, multi-professional physical activity referral (PAR) intervention is more effective in enhancing and maintaining self-reported physical activity than ordinary physical activity recommendations. The study targets patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes.  Secondary outcomes include: need of pharmacological therapy; blood pressure/plasma glucose; physical fitness and anthropometric variables; mental health; health related quality of life; and cost-effectiveness. Methods/Design The study is designed as a long-term intervention. Three primary care centres are involved in the study, each constituting one of three treatment groups: 1) Intervention group (IG): multi-professional team intervention with PAR, lifestyle brochure; 2) Control group A (CA): ordinary recommendations on health behaviours, lifestyle brochure; and 3) Control group B: treatment as usual (retrospective data collection).  The intervention is based on self-determination theory and follows the principles of motivational interviewing. Physical activity is measured with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and expressed as metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes per week. Physical fitness is estimated with the 6-minute walk test in IG only. Variables such as health behaviours; health-related quality of life; motivation to change; mental health; demographics and socioeconomic characteristics are assessed with an electronic study questionnaire that submits all data to a patient database, which automatically provides instant feed-back on the patients' health status.  Cost-effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated continuously and the intermediate  - 3 - outcomes of the intervention are extrapolated by economic modelling. The first statistical analyses and compilation of results will be performed one year after inclusion of the first patient or when the IG and CA have included 60 and 30 eligible patients respectively. Discussion By helping patients to overcome practical, social and cultural obstacles and increase their internal motivation for physical activity we aim to improve their physical health in a long-term perspective. The targeted patients belong to a patient category that is supposed to benefit from increased physical activity in terms of improved physiological values, mental status and quality of life, decreased risk of complications and maybe a decreased need of medication.

Comparison of Topical Latanoprost vs Topical Corticosteroid in Treatment of Localized Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disease that involves the hair follicles. Topical corticosteroids are the established agents for treating this disorder. There are several case reports and case series which have demonstrated the efficacy of topical prostaglandins. The two agents have not been compared head-to-head in the published literature. The investigators attempt to compare the efficacy and safety of topical betamethasone and topical latanoprost in the treatment of localised alopecia areata.
Non-Invasive Quantitative Imaging of Human Local Arterial Wall Elasticity Using Supersonic Shear Imaging Arterial stiffness is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and death.  Most of existing technique need dedicated device for arterial stiffness evaluation and indirect calculation of intra arterial pressure. Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI) is a novel non-invasive technique based on remote palpation of biological tissues that can image with very high temporal resolution (up to 10,000 images/s) and quantify the local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The investigators goal was to apply this SSI technique for arterial stiffness evaluation and local pulse wave velocity (PWV) calculation.  As a first step, the primary goal of this study is to establish normal values of local pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness (carotid and femoral) by SSI on hundred healthy volunteers.
Promoting Wellbeing: The Five Ways to All Intervention This project is funded by Stiftelsen Dam and is a cooperation between The Norwegian Council for Mental Health (NCMH) and PROMENTA research group at the University of Oslo. Low-cost and evidence-based health promoting public health tools are urgently needed in Norwegian municipalities, to meet both current and future challenges with mental health and wellbeing. The aim in this randomized controlled trail is to test if a shorter, 10 week web-based version (The Five Ways to All, "5WaysA"), of an already established course (Five Ways to Wellbeing course), can promote wellbeing and mastery in the general population. The principal investigator will investigate to what extend the effects are short-term and long-term (i.e., 10 weeks, 18 weeks and 12 months after starting to receive the 5WaysA intervention).

A Feasibility Study of the Bone@BC App Version 3.0 Introduction Due to improvements in diagnostics and treatments, the 5-year survival for patients with breast cancer is 80-90% after initial diagnosis. During treatments, patients typically have consultations weekly and then gradually reduce to annual visits. During this transition from hospital-based care to health self-management, the breast cancer survivors are encouraged to e.g. exercise because of accumulating evidence for the efficacy of exercise training in cancer survivorship, and in the majority of cases, adhere to endocrine treatments to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence.  Design and methods The study is a one-arm convergent parallel mixed-methods feasibility intervention study. The quantitative data will be the use of the Bone@bc app (intervention) and questionnaires (n=50) and the Qualitative data will be semi-structured interviews (n= 15 - 20)

Renal Insufficiency Following Contrast Media Administration Trial III The urine flow rate (UFR)-guided and the left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided hydration regimens have been proposed to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). The REnal Insufficiency Following Contrast MEDIA Administration TriaL III (REMEDIAL III) trial is a randomized, multicenter, investigator-sponsored trial aiming to compare these 2 hydration strategies in high risk patients.  Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate \<45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or a high risk for CI-AKI (as defined according to both Mehran's score ≥11 and/or Gurm's score \>7) will be enrolled. Patients will be divided in high (\>12 mm Hg) and normal LVEDP, non-invasively estimated by transmitral flow velocity to annular velocity ratio (E/E' index). Patients in each group will be randomly assigned to 1) LVEDP-guided hydration with normal saline (LVEDP-guided group). The fluid infusion rate will be adjusted according to the LVEDP as follows: 5 mL/kg/hr for LVEDP \<12 mmHg; 3 mL/kg/hr for 13-18 mmHg; and 1.5 mL/kg/hr for \>18 mmHg. 2) UFR-rate guided hydration (RenalGuard group). In this group, hydration with normal saline plus low-dose of furosemide is controlled by the RenalGuard system, in order to reach and maintain a high (\>300 mL/h) UFR. In all cases iobitridol (an low-osmolar, non ionic contrast agent) will be administered. The primary endpoint is the composite of CI-AKI (i.e., serum creatinine increase ≥ 25% and ≥ 0.5 mg/dl from the baseline value at 48 hours after contrast media exposure) and/or acute pulmonary edema.
Development of New Personalised 3D Preclinical Models of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours The goal of this prospective observational study is to generate new personalised 3D preclinical models of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

The Use of FNA and FNB in the Optimization of EUS-assisted Tissue Sampling Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology and/or fine needle biopsy (FNB) for histology may be used in the diagnostic work-up of intrathoracic and intrabdominal lesion of unknown origin. Certain lesions (such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma) are often well characterized by cytology assessment of FNA-samples while others are not (such as GIST-tumors).  This study is a part observational (early study phase) and part interventional study (late study phase) on the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-assisted tissue sampling by FNA or FNB during a 10-year period on a tertiary endoscopy centre.
Impact of Sitagliptin on Cardiovascular Exercise Performance in Type 2 Diabetes The goal of this study is to examine whether sitagliptin, an agent which enhances the action of hormones that control the release of insulin and is already in clinical use for type 2 diabetes, might also improve functional exercise capacity.  Specific aims:  1. To test whether sitagliptin will improve functional exercise capacity in persons with type 2 diabetes compared to glimepiride.  1a. The primary outcome will be peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and oxygen uptake kinetics (VO2 kinetics).  1b. Secondary outcomes include cardiac function, endothelial function and tissue oxygen saturation (STO2) as well as health-related quality of life.  2. To evaluate the impact of sitagliptin on muscle mitochondrial function 2a. The primary outcome to address this aim will be 31P measurements (phosphocreatine, free inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate peaks, adenosine diphosphate and pH)  Impact: Novel approaches are needed to decrease excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetes. Diabetes impairs cardiovascular fitness and thereby mortality. A demonstration that sitagliptin improves cardiovascular fitness, (and possibly mitochondrial function) will provide important new data pertinent to the management of diabetes and pre-diabetes.
Reduced-dose Chemotherapy Followed by Blinatumomab in Induction Therapy of Newly Diagnosed Non-elderly Ph-B-ALL Blinatumomab, a CD3/CD19 bisespecific T-cell conjugative antibody, has shown high efficacy in phase I/II studies of relapsed/refractory B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly in the context of low tumor burden.Meanwhile, Blinatumomab also plays an important role in rapid and efficient clearance of MRD in patients. Therefore, its use in combination with less intensive chemotherapy for initial induction therapy in newly diagnosed patients may result in favorable response rates, greater depth of remission, and lower treatment-related toxic effects.  In this study, newly diagnosed non-elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosomal negative (PH-) B-ALL were enrolled and treated with reduced-intensity chemotherapy followed by Blinatumomab as the basis of induction therapy. The clinical remission rate, MRD negative rate and treaty-related adverse reactions were evaluated in newly diagnosed non-elderly PH-B-ALL patients during induction therapy.

Recovering From Intimate Partner Violence Through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE) Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health concern for women Veterans. IPV is associated with numerous physical and mental health conditions. VHA is implementing IPV screening programs to identify female patients who experience past-year IPV. Despite strong evidence that screening increases detection of IPV, less is established about how to intervene following IPV disclosure in health care settings, in order to improve health outcomes. Existing healthcare-based interventions result in minimal effects on health and well-being, likely because they are too brief and generic.  In response, the PI has developed Recovering from IPV through Strengths and Empowerment (RISE), based on the IPV-related health care needs and preferences of women Veterans. RISE is designed to be delivered in primary care and is an individualized, variable-length, modular-based intervention that addresses  * safety planning; * education on the health effects of IPV and warning signs; * increasing coping skills and self-care; * enhancing social support; * making difficult decisions; and * connecting with resources. This study is aimed at refining and evaluating RISE for use with female VA patients who have experienced past-year IPV. This brief counseling intervention is intended to be administered in conjunction with primary care, as this is a frequent point of healthcare contact for women Veterans and where disclosure of IPV is most prevalent.
KITS Study -Ketorolac In Tonsillectomy Surgery: a Double Blinded, Randomized Clinical Trial Our group wishes to test the novel hypothesis that intraoperative use of ketorolac in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy reduces post-operative nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain scores, subsequent narcotic use, and length of hospital stay without adversely affecting post-operative bleed risk, when compared to placebo, in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Honduras Liger Thermocoagulator Study This was a prospective study to evaluate the short-term safety and acceptability of the Liger Medical thermal coagulation device for treatment of cervical precancerous lesions. Study results will inform the Honduras Ministry of Health regarding potential use of the Liger device for precancer treatment in Honduras and results may be of interest to other Latin American settings as well.  The research was conducted in the Tegucigalpa Region in Honduras in 4 health facilities in urban and peri-urban settings. Participants were women ages 30-49 who met the study eligibility criteria. Human papilloma virus (HPV) and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA)-positive women who were eligible for ablative treatment were offered thermal coagulation with the Liger instrument to treat their lesions and asked about acceptability of the treatment. At this visit, biopsies were also be taken. Women were followed-up at 1 month to evaluate short-term safety outcomes with a physical exam and receive their biopsy results. Depending on their biopsy results, they will be asked to return for repeat screening, referred for further treatment or asked to come back for a 12-month study visit. At the 12-month visit after treatment, women were followed up to evaluate cure rates.  A second investigational device, Pocket Colposcope, was used to take cervix photos at the enrollment and 12-month study visit with participant consent. The photos were used to explore factors influencing treatment failure. De-identified photos and women's diagnosis information were also shared with the device developers, Duke University, for the purposes of improving their device. Women had the option to opt out of having cervix photos taken and still participate in the treatment portion of the study.
Minimally Invasive Ridge Augmentation The present study is a human, prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial conducted to explore the outcome of a minimally invasive ridge augmentation technique with and without low level laser therapy. The trial is in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) criteria, 2010.
Milk Consumption and the Metabolic Syndrome in Menopausal Women Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the first cause of mortality in industrialized countries such as Canada and the United States. In that regard, it is being increasingly recognized that a significant proportion of CVD events may be attributable to the presence of a cluster of metabolic and physiological perturbations defined as the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The National Cholesterol Education Program- Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) has recently proposed a clinical definition to identify individuals with the MetS. This definition is based on the presence of at least three of the following five characteristics: 1- abdominal obesity, 2- hypertriglyceridemia, 3- reduced plasma HDL-C levels, 4- high blood pressure, 5- high fasting blood glucose levels. Recent data have suggested that the MetS based on this definition was associated with a 2 to 5 fold increase in the risk of CVD in men as well as in women. These are alarming figures since it has been suggested that as much as 35 to 45% of female aged \> 65 years in the US may have the MetS. It is therefore imperative to develop new preventive strategies that will be efficacious in attenuating the impact of the MetS on the progressing rates of CVD in women. In that context, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that milk and dairy products may beneficially modify several components of the MetS. However, most of the available data to date are based on observational studies or interventional studies with minimal nutritional control. Thus, metabolically controlled studies that document the impact of milk consumption on cardiovascular risk factors associated with the MetS in women defined a priori as having the MetS are utterly lacking.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of milk consumption on features of the MetS in menopausal women presenting one or more features of the MetS.
Impact Study of Cholera Vaccination in Endemic Areas - Clinical Surveillance This project aims to fill this essential knowledge gap by assessing the impact of oral cholera vaccine mass campaigns in 2 sites (urban and rural) in DRC, described in this protocol. The evidence generated from this project will be key to develop future strategies regarding cholera vaccine use in endemic settings, including places with higher burden in terms of cholera mortality.
An Observational Study to Assess Ubrogepant Tablets and Atogepant Tablets to Treat Migraine in Adult Participants Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by moderate or severe headache, associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light and sound. This study will evaluate how effective the use of ubrogepant and atogepant is in treating adult participants with migraine.  Urogepant (Ubrelvy) and Atogepant (Qulipta) are approved drugs for treatment of migraine in adults in the US. Approximately 200 adult participants who are prescribed Ubrogepant or atogepant by their doctors will be enrolled in this study in Israel.  Participants will receive ubrogepant oral tablets or atogepant oral tablets as prescribed by their physician. Participants will be followed for 90 days.  There is expected to be no additional burden for participants in this trial. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic according to their routine clinical practice.
Storage Symptom After Laser Prostatectomy Recent literature indicated that postoperative storage symptoms after Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) or holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) were often reported and generally more common than after transurethral prostatectomy (TURP). However, almost all literature focused on postoperative urgency or dysuria immediately after PVP or HoLEP. Thus, there has been a scarcity of data on serial changes of storage symptoms in the postoperative period after PVP or HoLEP and data on predicting factors that influence improvement in storage symptoms postoperatively. The aim of this study was to compare serial changes of postoperative storage symptoms between PVP and HoLEP, and to identify the predictors that influence improvement of storage symptoms postoperatively.

Clınıcal Results of Evelator and Free Knot Methods In Medial Menıscus Posterior Root Tears In this thesis study, the transtibial pullout method, which is one of the treatment methods for medial meniscus posterior root tear, will be used in patients over the age of 18 with medial meniscus posterior root tear, who applied to the Atatürk University Orthopedics and Traumatology clinic. The patients will be divided into two groups. In the first group, after knotting the posterior root of the medial meniscus with a fiber rope, a tunnel will be opened for the rope to pass through the medial of the proximal crest of the tibia. Then, arthroscopically, the rope will be taken through the joint and passed through the tunnel, and the knot will be fixed to the tibia by using the endobutton elevator system. In the second group, the first stage of fixation is the same, and fixation to the tibia will be done with an endobutton by tying a free knot without using an elevator system. The clinical and radiological scores of both groups just before the operation and at the twelve months after the operation will be calculated and their relationship with each other will be examined.
Comparison of a Non-linear Analysis of Balance During the mBESS to the Sway Balance Application In order to determine equivalency of the Avert Sample Entropy algorithm's ability to be sensitive to different balance conditions, participants will complete the modified balance error scoring system (mBESS) while standing on a portable force platform. Human-rated errors during the mBESS conditions will be recorded, in addition to measuring balance using the Sway app. These will be compared for levels of agreement and direction of bias using Bland-Altman analyses.
Multi-factorial Analysis of the Follicular Fluid Milieu to Explore the Discrepant Effect of Follicular Fluid Endometrial Flushing on Outcome of Assisted Reproduction Trial Patients \& Methods: Eighty infertile women were randomly categorized into: Group EF (n=40) had EF after oocyte retrieval and Control group (n=40) did not have EF. All women were subjecte to the standard down-regulation regimen followed by controlled ovarian hyper stimulation . Oocytes were retrieved 34-36 h after hCG administration and aspirated FF was collected and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 10 min and 5-ml sample of supernatant was obtained for ELISA estimation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leptin and anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels in both groups. The remaining amount was used for EF in EF group and was discarded in control group. Pregnancy was diagnosed by measurement of β-HCG level and confirmed by transvaginal sonography as clinical pregnancy
Nicotinic Modulation of the Default Network Many disorders where attentional problems are a hallmark, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, display abnormal regulation of the so-called default network of resting brain function that maintains internally directed thought when the mind is free to wander. There is indication that nicotine may improve attention by aiding the deactivation of the default network, and this mechanism may be of therapeutic benefit for the above disease states. The current project aims at providing a proof of concept by demonstrating that nicotinic drugs modulate default network function. The nicotinic agonist nicotine is hypothesized to improve attention by facilitating the down-regulation of default network activity, and the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine is hypothesized to impair attention by impeding the down-regulation of default network activity during attentional task performance.
Intraoperative Analysis of the Central Retina in ERF Changes in the retinal anatomy that occur in epiretinal fibrosis have not been sufficiently studied. It is possible that epiretinal fibrosis leads not only to traction dislocation of the macula, but also to ILM anatomical disorders.
Prevention of Severe Anaemia in Gambian Children Severe anaemia is a frequent cause of admission to hospitals in tropical Africa and about 10% of such children die. In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as nutritional deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies. However, Plasmodium falciparum infection is believed to be the major contributory factor to the aetiology of severe anaemia. Severe anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries the attendant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Thus, there is a need to explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk groups such as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at increased risk of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their haemoglobin level has normalized. Therefore, it is proposed to study whether monthly chemoprophylaxis with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) given during malaria transmission season can protect Gambian children from developing severe anaemia. After receiving treatment from the hospital, 1200 children admitted to the hospital with a haematocrit of less than 21% were randomised to receive either monthly S/P or placebo during the rest of the malaria transmission season. Morbidity was monitored throughout the rainy season. Study subjects were seen at the end of the dry season to document morbidity and mortality.

There will be a washout of at least 14 days between each study period.
Armodafinil for Patients Starting Hepatitis C Virus Treatment Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of the treatment of hepatitis C infection with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, and is a major cause of treatment discontinuation. Armodafinil is an FDA approved stimulant medication for the treatment of narcolepsy and shift-work sleep disorder. This is a randomized placebo controlled study to determine whether patients assigned to armodafinil have fewer missed doses, dose reductions or treatment discontinuation due to side effects in the first 12 weeks of treatment for hepatitis C infection than do placebo patients. Placebo patients are offered 14 weeks of open label armodafinil after Week 12.
Safety and Efficiency of γδ T Cell Against Lung Cancer In this study, effects of γδT cells on human Lung Cancer in combination with tumor reducing surgery, for example, cryosurgery going to be investigated
Correlation Between Circulating Biomarkers of Organs Damage and Intraoperative Hypotension Management Intraoperative hypotension (defined as mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg) is associated with increased organs dysfunction and mortality. Even short durations of reduced arterial blood pressure episodes significantly increased the risk of myocardial injury, neurological deficits, renal failure, and mortality. Hypotension rate during surgery is quite common and recent studies showed an incidence up to 60% of patients endured hypotension during anesthesia for an average of 10% of surgical time.  Nowadays hypotension seems to be preventable even if current management of the hypotensive episodes is predominantly reactive and rather occurs with some delay.  The investigators hypothesize that the prevention of hypotension by means Edwards Lifesciences new technology (HPI software) can improve patients outcome after surgery.  The present pilot randomized clinical trial is aimed at investigating various biomarkers involved in organ dysfunction and how they correlate with different intraoperative hypotension management strategies (Invasive blood pressure monitored by a normal arterial line vs Invasive blood pressure monitored by Edwards FloTracIQ system with HPI software).

Disability-adjusted Life Years in a Senegalese Cohort of Patients With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the extravasation of blood into the subarachnoid space from traumatic or nontraumatic origin. There is a paucity of data on the burden of SAH in African countries. In this study, we analyzed data from patients in the largest neurovascular center in Senegal to determine the sex- and age-adjusted burden of SAH in Senegal.
Oral Probiotics Reduce Group B Streptococci Colonization in Pregnant Women The purpose of this study is to examine whether daily use of oral gelatin capsules containing dried viable Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 can reduce the GBS colonization rate of vagina and rectum in pregnant women who present with GBS-positive diagnosed by GBS culture at 35-37 weeks gestation.  This study is a prospective double blind randomized clinical trial. Vaginal and rectal GBS screening culture are carried out for all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestation in our out-patient department. Subjects with vagina and rectum GBS colonization are invited to participate in our study after informed consent. A total of 200 pregnant women will participate in the study during the 12-months trial period. They are randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The study group is treated with two oral capsules of probiotics once daily (before sleeping) for 14 days, and the control group will take 2 capsules of placebos. Vaginal and rectal GBS culture is repeated for all participators 2 weeks later. All participators will treated according to GBS guideline by CDC in 2002 during laboring.
High-Dose Melphalan Followed by Peripheral Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Amyloidosis RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of plasma cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Having a peripheral stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows higher doses of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. By reducing the number of plasma cells, the disease may progress more slowly.  PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving high-dose melphalan together with peripheral stem cell transplant works in treating patients with primary amyloidosis or amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma.

Effects of an Online Meditation Course on Quality of Life Many interventions in the field of meditation are becoming increasingly popular and have gained worldwide acceptance over the past years, both in terms of health, but also psychological aspects. On the other hand, controversial and sometimes hypercritical positions are on the rise, questioning the positive effects of meditation on health due to the limited availability of high-quality scientific data. With regard to a large number of meditation interventions, the systematic exploration of procedures that have not yet been scientifically evaluated - also in online settings - is a meaningful contribution to meditation research.
Cardiorespiratory and Acid-basic Imbalance Caused by Use of Mask The study aims to evaluate whether the use of polypropylene and elastane Lupo ® masks can be considered as a significant causal agent in cases of respiratory and acid-base imbalances. For this, gas parameters such as lactate, bicarbonate, Sat02, pH, Sat02, P02 and PC02 of people before and after the practice of aerobic physical exercises will be measured. The control group will perform the exercise without wearing a mask and the study group will perform the exercise using a mask.
Breaks in Sedentary Time and Glucose Regulation in Women The number of people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing rapidly and about 2.9 million people in the UK currently have diabetes. There is increasing evidence suggesting that prolonged sedentary time may actually increase the risk of diabetes and other chronic diseases. Importantly, adults can meet public health guidelines on physical activity (150 minutes of moderate activity per week), but if they still sit for prolonged periods, their metabolic health is compromised. Going from sitting to standing and carrying out light-intensity activities (such as casual walking) may reduce diabetes risk. However, no one has investigated the effect of standing and walking on markers of cardio-metabolic markers in individuals with a high risk of T2DM. Therefore, the aim is to find out whether reducing the amount of time people spend sitting and replacing it with standing and light intensity activity (walking) reduces glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels, therefore reducing the risk of diabetes.
Organ Motion and Early Tumor Response Measurement To quantify motion based variation of the target volume of the primary tumor over the course of chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer patients, and to use this information to calculate appropriate PTV (planning target volume) margins according to the margins recipe for patients receiving trimodality (neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery) or definitive chemoradiation in order to personalize radiation treatment, resulting in either better target coverage or a reduction in normal tissue radiation exposure.

Safety and Efficacy of GSMs-TACE Combined With Surgical Resection in Treatment of Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) (≥10cm) A Single center, Open, Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of GSMs-TACE combined with Surgical Resection in Treatment of Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) (≥10cm).
Gene-Modified T Cells, Vaccine Therapy, and Ipilimumab in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Malignancies This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of taking ipilimumab after gene-modified T cells and vaccine therapy when treating patients with advanced cancer that has spread to other areas of the body and has not responded to standard therapies. This trial also will determine the best dose of Ipilimumab to use in this combination treatment. T cells are a special type of white blood cell (immune cell) that have the ability to kill cancer cells. T cells are taken from the blood and modified in the laboratory to recognize a specific protein expressed on cancer cells, called NY-ESO-1. This may allow the T cells to target and kill cancer cells that express that protein. Dendritic cells are another type of blood cell that can teach other cells in the body to look for cancer cells and attack them. Giving a dendritic cell vaccine with the NY-ESO-1 protein may help dendritic cells teach the immune system to target cancer cells expressing that protein, and further help the T cells attack cancer. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody, a type of drug manufactured in the laboratory that is similar to antibodies made in the human body that fight off infection. Ipilimumab blocks a protein that turns down the immune system, so blocking this protein may make the immune system more active. This may increase the ability of immune cells to kill cancer cells and improve the effectiveness of the T cell transplant. Giving gene-modified T-cells, a dendritic cell vaccine, and ipilimumab together may teach the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells that have the NY-ESO-1 protein.

Plasma Triglyceride Lipolysis in Multifactorial Chylomicronemia Purpose: The mechanism of most of the multifactorial chylomicronemia (MCM) remains elusive. In order to decipher the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of this disease, plasma TG lipolysis characteristics will be monitored for 60 minutes after heparin injection instead of the 10 minutes gold standard, in a large group of genotyped MCM patients.
Utilizing Non-Invasive Fibroscan® Technology to Identify Genetic Markers for Fatty Liver Progression Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder, affecting \~30% of people in the general population and up to 96% of obese individuals. Variations in several genes have been found to be associated with fatty liver, but these associations only explain a small percentage of the risk, and further studies are needed. In many cases NAFLD does not cause serious side effects, but in some individuals it progresses to scarring or hardening of the liver, liver failure, and cancer.  The purpose of this research study is to determine if individuals who carry certain genetic variations in a gene related to bile and choline metabolism have an increased risk of fatty liver progressing to fibrosis, or scarring of the liver. This study will also use a new, non-invasive method called the FibroScan® to measure liver fat and liver stiffness. The FibroScan® device is FDA approved for use to measure liver stiffness, but not for the liver fat measurement. However, the FibroScan® instrument is considered a non-significant risk device. Since its induction in Europe and worldwide in 2003, there have been no adverse effects reported with this device.
Natrecor (Nesiritide) in Transplant-Eligible Management of Congestive Heart Failure-TMAC The purposes of this study in United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Status 1B (or country equivalent) cardiac transplant candidates are to assess the safety and efficacy of Natrecor (nesiritide). The study will evaluate the drug's ability to prevent clinical worsening when administered as a 28-day continuous intravenous infusion in patients receiving standard care and continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine or milrinone.
Neurocognitive Outcomes in Mild Hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP)MHP Study Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder known to cause severe reduction in intelligence and deficits in cognitive function; it is associated with an elevated level of Phenylalanine (Phe) in blood.  Newborn screening and early treatment with restricted protein diet supplemented by a formula of amino-acids will preserve intelligence. In those with the severe form treated from birth, some deficits that affect higher functions of the brain are seen.  Given this, there is disagreement about how milder forms of this disease should be managed and what level of Phe is safe to be left untreated.  We seek to assess whether higher Phe levels, between 360 and 600µmol/L, are safe with respect to preservation of intelligence and higher cognitive functions.
The Role of Preoperative Oral Immunonutrition in Major Vascular Surgery The role of preoperative oral immunonutrition in major vascular surgery.

This group was compared to a control group.  Secondary purpose was to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral immunonutrition on postoperative mortality (30 days), the medium length of stay in the hospital and the cost of treatment in the two groups
Evaluation of a Prototype Diabetes Management System Applied to Insulin Initiation and Titration The purpose of this study is to determine if using a diabetes management technology system, including a tablet computer, to track diabetes care and communicate with a clinician coach (a doctor or nurse from the Joslin Clinic) makes starting and adjusting insulin easier and safer for people with type 2 diabetes. Hypothesis: The use of a diabetes management technology system with a clinician coach helps more individuals starting basal insulin achieve better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia compared with standard clinical practice at Joslin Diabetes Center.
Stanford Clinics Physician Mindset Training Mindsets play an important role in motivating and shaping health behavior and outcomes. For example, when patients have the mindset that a treatment will work, they are more likely to adhere to treatment medications and the treatment itself becomes more effective as a result of this mindset. Providers have an opportunity to shape important patient mindsets as part of clinical care, and these mindsets may influence patients' adherence to medication, screening and vaccination recommendations, and diet, exercise, and treatment recommendations that can help patients manage chronic illness. To help care teams capitalize on the potential of leveraging mindsets in medicine and improve patient health behavior and outcomes, we developed and implemented the Medicine Plus Mindset Training as part of Primary Care 2.0. Built on more than two decades of research, this training program (a) Informs Primary Care teams about the power of patient mindsets in shaping treatment outcomes (b) Provides care teams with a language and framework to identify which patient mindsets may be at play (i.e. patient mindsets about illness, treatment, their body, and the provider/care team) and (c) Equips care teams with skills and techniques to effectively shape patient mindsets to improve health outcomes. By motivating care teams to recognize patient mindsets that may be hindering health behavior change (such as "this illness is a catastrophe") or medication adherence (such as "this medication is going to cause side effects"), care teams become better equipped to help their patients adopt more useful mindsets (such as "this treatment will work," "this illness is manageable," "my body is capable," and "I am in good hands").
PrevenTion of Contrast-inducEd nephroAThy With urinE Alkalinization Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media is an essential tool for cardiovascular imaging and percutaneous coronary interventions. Nonetheless, the increasing incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has become an important and prognostically relevant problem along with the spreading of diagnostic and interventional procedures. CIN is largely dependent on oxidative damage and represents a considerable cause of renal failure, being associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant morbidity/mortality. The most effective treatment strategy of this serious complication remains prevention, and several preventive measures have been extensively investigated in the last few years. Pre-procedural hydration is the best known and mostly accepted strategy. The administration of sodium bicarbonate (HCO3) has controversial effects, and is likely to be ineffective when the infused dose is unable to achieve adequate urine alkalinization. Since alkaline pH suppresses the production of free radicals, increasing urine pH would be an attractive goal for CIN prevention. In a randomized clinical trial the investigators will test the hypothesis that urine alkalinization with either oral or i.v. bicarbonate on top of hydration alone is the main determinant of CIN prevention in a population of patients with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease scheduled for coronary angiography and/or angioplasty. If the investigators, demonstrate non-significant differences in urine alkalinization (primary endpoint) and incidence of CIN (secondary endpoint) between the bicarbonate groups, a practical implication will be that oral administration is preferable for practical reasons over the administration of i.v. bicarbonate.

Return of Continence Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy With or Without a Urethrovesical Sling The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of an absorbable urethrovesical sling on the post-operative return of urinary continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.
Predicting Hypotension Related to Spinal Anesthesia for Caesarean Section With Ultrasonography Spinal anesthesia is the main technique for caesarean section. This anesthesia is followed by a hypotension in 40% to 90% despite preventing tools. Hypotension is responsible of foetale and maternal suffering. It would be interesting to have a tool that could detect patient who are at risk to have hypotension.This study consist in measuring variations of under aortic velocity peak (ΔITVAo) which estimate the modification of the cardiac output by Trans thoraciq echography.
Interest of CPET to Predict Mortality and Complications of Lung Resection Candidates Anatomic lung resection is the treatment of choice for the management of cancerous lung nodules Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). Systematic functional evaluation can reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity of candidates. Scientific societies recommend a cardiac and spirometry evaluation (including pulmonary diffusion capacity). In this context, patients with FEV1 or less than 80% of the predicted value are subjected to a more thorough evaluation of the physical physical capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to determine VO2 max (Brunelli et al 2009). Patients with a VO2 max \<35% of predicted values or \<10ml/kg/min, or a postoperative predicted value of DLCO or FEV1(ppoDLCO, ppoVEMS) less than 30% associated with a postoperative VO2max less than 35% or 10 ml/min/kg should be offered an alternative treatment option (Begum et al 2016). In contrast, a VO2max greater than 20ml/min/kg is considered at low surgical risk (Brunelli et al 2009).  For patients with a VO2 max between 10 and 20ml/kg/min, operability depends on the extent of the resection. In this group of patients, other parameters measured with CPET could be used to optimize the selection of patients given the inability of some the inability of some patients to provide a maximal effort, thus resulting in a sub-maximal evaluation of physical capacity.  The VE/VCO2 slope, ventilatory equivalents or chronotropic recovery are parameters classically used in classically used in heart failure and have recently been shown to be independent prognostic factors as independent prognostic factors for 90-day and 2-year mortality after anatomical lung resection. Moreover, these factors do not depend on the maximality of the test and could again help us to risk-stratify for a sub-maximal and therefore not optimal test.
FDG Tumor Heterogeneity During Chemoradiation as a Predictor of Response in Patients With Cervical Cancer In this study, 50 evaluable patients will undergo one FDG-PET study during their chemoradiation, in addition to the standard of care pretreatment and 3-month post-treatment clinical FDG-PET/CT or FDG-PET/MR scans. From all FDG-PET studies, tumor volume, SUVmax, FDGhetero, and texture maps will be obtained. Evaluating the changes in tumor SUVmax and heterogeneity during treatment will aid in better understanding the role of these biological parameters in inadequate response to chemoradiation. Other researchers, using MRI imaging, have evaluated changes in the cervical tumor volume during treatment. The investigators expect there will be variation in how cervical tumors shrink and change during chemoradiation and therefore we are going to use multiple measures in addition to tumor volume to evaluate cervical tumor metabolic heterogeneity. Being able to predict at diagnosis the patients who are at higher risk for persistent disease following chemoradiation would allow for future studies where these high risk patients could be specifically targeted with more aggressive therapy.

Pilot Study of Non-Myeloablative, HLA-Matched Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Pediatric Hematopoietic Malignancies Background:  * Allogeneic blood and marrow stem cell transplantation (BMT) plays an important role in the curative treatment of a number of pediatric malignancies. Unfortunately, the success of conventional allogeneic BMT is limited in part by the multiple toxicities associated with myeloablative preparative regimens. * Non-myeloablative pre-transplant regimens are associated with less toxic side effects than standard BMT. Recently, a novel immunosuppressive, non-myeloablative pre-transplant chemotherapy regimen has been shown to facilitate complete donor engraftment in an adult trial at the NCI.  Objectives:  The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach in pediatric patients with hematopoietic malignancies  Eligibility:  Inclusion Criteria  Age: Patient must be greater than or equal to 5 years and less than 22 years of age.  Diagnosis:  * Hodgkin s and Non-Hodgkin s Lymphoma: Refractory disease or relapse after salvage regimen. * Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: History of bone marrow relapse in remission (CR) #2 or greater. * Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia: History of bone marrow relapse in CR #2 or greater (CR#1 with Philadelphia chromosome positive or prior induction failure). * Acute Hybrid Leukemia including mixed lineage, biphenotypic and undifferentiated: History of bone marrow relapse in CR #2 or greater (CR#1 with Philadelphia chromosome positive or prior induction failure). * Myelodysplastic Syndrome: RAEB or RAEB-t with less than 10% blasts in marrow and blood. * Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia: Chronic phase or accelerated phase with less than 10% blasts in marrow and blood. * Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia: less than 10% blasts in marrow and blood.

Postoperative Delirium - European Society of Anaesthesiology Survey The ESA is currently preparing a guideline on the management of postoperative delirium (POD), which attempts to reduce the impact of postoperative delirium and provide recommendations for prevention, diagnostics and treatment of delirium outside the intensive care unit. The guidelines are going to be published during 2015.  While the guideline provides recommendations for daily practice, assessment of current practice and knowledge is of utmost importance, because the implementation and the measurement of a change in clinical practice will be dependent on these measurements.  This Survey has been approved by the Scientific and Research Committees of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA), the Media Committee of the ESA, as well as the institutional ethical committee of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Laser Spot Treatment of Perioral Rhytids Perioral rhytides present a difficult problem in facial rejuvenation. They cannot be addressed with rhytidectomy (face lift) and direct excision can leave visible unfavorable scars. Currently, fine static wrinkles are most effectively treated with facial resurfacing, usually with laser treatment. Often the peri-oral area is treated with additional spot treatments with an ablative laser to cause a more robust healing response and better aesthtic result. To date, no studies have specifically shown efficacy of additional spot treatment over full facial laser alone.  This study is designed as a split-face study, to compare the aesthetic results of full field laser resurfacing on one half of the face with that of spot treatment of perioral rhytides on the other half.  To clarify further to the IRB board, this is not an experimental treatment. Spot treatment is used by many surgeons/laser proceduralists for addressing specific areas of the face. This is an FDA indicated use of the laser for facial resurfacing. Due to the many genetic and enviromental factors that can effect the results the best design for the study to is have each patient serve as their own control with a split-face study.
Patient Blood Management in Orthopedic Surgical Patients in Turkey Transfusion practice for surgical patients has changed from replacing surgically lost blood with allogeneic blood transfusions to implementing strategies that reduce transfusion requirements. Patient Blood Management (PBM), which is "the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to maintain haemoglobin concentration, optimize hemostasis and minimize blood loss in an effort to improve patient outcome. There is mounting evidence that multimodal patient blood management (PBM) programmes can be effective at improving postoperative outcomes and reducing perioperative blood transfusions and costs The Turkish Society of Anaesthesiologists PBM Task Force has been working on this subject and studied transfusion practice throughout all through the peri-operative periods. Unfortunately we documented a high transfusion rate in major surgical patients in Turkey. One of the surgeries, that has high transfusion rate, was orthopaedic surgery. According to our recent data we planned to implement PBM in major orthopaedic surgical patients and evaluate the effects PBM in transfusion rate and patient outcomes. While some elements of PBM have a strong evidence base in hip or knee replacement, such as the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) the evidence for preoperative anaemia optimisation with iron is less robust. Implementing PBM all through the operative period gains more importance.
Improved Medically Assisted Procreation Monitoring Patient care in Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP) requires a close and regular monitoring of the evolution of the estradiol rate. This monitoring allows the dose and duration of treatment to be accurately adjusted for each woman (every 24 or 48 hours) up to 10 to 15 days of treatment with gonadotrophins. Oestradiol (E2) is secreted by the growing ovarian follicles and reflects their growth and maturity. Its plasma dosage makes it possible to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation.  This monitoring involves several constraints amongst which disruption of work life, stress, fatigue that can alter the response to treatment

Effectiveness of the Suboccipital Inhibition Technique in Patients With Mechanical Neck Pain The project is based on checking the effectiveness of the technique of suboccipital inhibition in patients with mechanical neck pain. Suboccipital inhibition technique involves the placement of the hands of the physiotherapist under the patient's head so that fingers can feel the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae. Then the fingers slowly leads upward to contact the occipital condyles. At this point the investigator should gently move your fingers down, finding the space between the condyles and the spinous process of the axis. Then, flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints at 90 degrees, slowly raises the skull. In this technique the investigator would be carrying out the relaxation of the suboccipital muscles: lower rectus capitis posterior, superior oblique head straight back and head higher. It is a technique used very often but without knowledge about the time needed for implementation. In several studies that have used the technique it has been maintained for 2.4 or 10 minutes without agreeing how long is necessary. The study will consist of three groups formed by patients with mechanical neck pain that they applied the technique two, four or ten minutes and a control group of patients with mechanical neck pain. The four groups were measured before and after treatment the pain threshold to pressure by algometer and conduct the test repositioning of the head to show any changes after application of the technique.

Neural Mechanisms of Motor Recovery With Technology Assisted Training Stroke is a leading cause of disability that often impairs arm function and activities of daily living. The costs of rehabilitation are significant and practical constraints often limit therapy to the first few months after stroke. However many studies have shown that patients in the later stages post-stroke can still continue to benefit from rehabilitation. Technology-assisted therapy may offer a means to efficiently provide ongoing therapies to patients in the later stages (\>6 months) post-stroke. This study will determine which patients are best able to benefit from this therapy approach, and will also expand our knowledge of which brain structures need to be intact for patients to benefit from technology-assisted training. The results of this study will help to improve rehabilitation and quality of life for disabled Americans.

Reducing the Burden of Influenza After Solid-Organ Transplantation Influenza is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients and it is mainly prevented by seasonal influenza vaccination. Unfortunately, the immunogenicity of standard influenza vaccine is suboptimal in this population. Vaccination with a high-dose (HD) influenza vaccine or an MF59-adjuvanted (MF59a) vaccine have significantly reduced the incidence of influenza and increased the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in the elderly. The investigators will compare the immunogenicity and efficacy of two new vaccination strategies, consisting in vaccination with a HD influenza vaccine or an MF59a influenza vaccine, to the standard-dose non-adjuvanted vaccination (standard of care) in a population of SOT recipients.

Community-engaged Approaches to Testing in Community and Healthcare Settings for Underserved Populations The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in substantial global morbidity and mortality including in Oklahoma and caused unprecedented interruptions in nearly all aspects of our lives. The population of the state of Oklahoma is at particular risk to SARS-CoV-2 due to its large rural population, strained healthcare system, and poor overall health. The Community-Engaged Approaches to Testing in Community and Healthcare Settings for Underserved Populations (CATCH-UP) program will involve both practice-based and community-based approaches to maximize the reach of the RADx-UP consortium, broaden the potential perspectives that could be captured, and compare the effectiveness of strategies. The interventions will be pragmatic to allow CATCH-UP to respond to changing attitudes, barriers, and environments as the pandemic progresses as well as expected technology developments to produce more effective viral testing that can provide rapid results to patients. The investigators will assist 50 small primary care practices to implement guidelines-based testing and patient education about COVID-19 and risk mitigation strategies. The project's community-based approach is designed to rapidly respond to community testing needs by deploying mobile testing sites that will provide operational support to increase the efficiency and the existing capacity for state-wide testing by Oklahoma's public health authorities. Together, the investigators estimate that the CATCH-UP program will result in at least 105,000 SARS-CoV-2 tests performed during the first year of implementation. A comprehensive, ongoing evaluation will be performed to analyze patient and provider attitudes, barriers and facilitators of viral testing, identified health disparities caused by COVID-19, effectiveness of the intervention in both settings, and to allow robust collaboration with other RADx-UP consortium sites.
Genetic Association of Diabetic Retinopathy-1 The primary purpose of the study is to investigate allele frequencies of candidate genes in Chinese diabetic patients with or without known diabetic retinopathy. Two hundred Chinese diabetic patients, aged between 20 - 75 years old, who have received ophthalmic fundus examination (either by an ophthalmoscope or fundus camera) within 6 months before the study will be recruited for the study. Each subject will receive anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Then, fasting blood samples will be taken for the measurements of glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, and biochemistry. An additional 10 ml blood sample will be taken for DNA extraction from buffy coat. Meanwhile, the participant will receive structural questionnaires for demography, personal history, medical history and concomitant medication. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and in targeted chromosome regions will be genotyped by using the ABI TaqMan assays. The differences in the distribution of genotypes and alleles between the study groups will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Through the study, the investigators hope to build up a platform for future large-scale genetic studies of diabetic retinopathy. The investigators also hope to set up priority of candidate loci for future studies.

New Hypo-Osmolar ORS (Recommended by WHO) for Routine Use in the Diarrhea Management- Surveillance Study for Adverse Effects For more than 25 years WHO and UNICEF have recommended a single formulation of glucose-based Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) to prevent or treat dehydration from diarrhoea irrespective of the cause or age group affected. This product has proven effective and contributed substantially to the dramatic global reduction in mortality from diarrhoeal disease during the period.  Based on more than two decades of research and recommendations by an expert group, WHO and UNICEF reviewed the effectiveness of a new ORS formula with reduced concentration of glucose and salts. Because of the improved effectiveness of this new ORS solution WHO and UNICEF recommended that countries use and manufacture this new formulation in place of the old one. While recommending this new ORS the experts also recommended that further monitoring is desirable to better assess the risk, if any of symptomatic hyponatraemia (low blood level of sodium salt). This is a surveillance study to evaluate adverse effect of routinely using the new ORS in a hospital admitting over 20,000 patients with diarrhea of all ages including cholera. If the new ORS is found safe, it will provide added confidence in its global use.

Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant This randomized phase III trial studies lenalidomide to see how well it works compared to a placebo in treating patients with multiple myeloma who are undergoing autologous stem cell transplant. Giving chemotherapy before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving lenalidomide after autologous stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for multiple myeloma.

Risk of Urinary Retention With Retigabine A prospective cohort study of antiepileptic drug (AED) polytherapy-treated epilepsy patients within the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) will be conducted. Following the launch of Ezogabine (EZG), patients initiating a new AED polytherapy regimen will be followed until the earliest of an episode of urinary retention (UR), change in their AED regimen, end of follow-up, or end of study (when the specified sample size of EZG AED polytherapy users has been attained). After the end of study, the incidence of UR during exposures to EZG and non-EZG AED polytherapies will be compared. Polytherapy will be defined as treatment regimen containing at least two different AEDs.  A prospective cohort study of patients who receive EZG under circumstances not indicated in the product label within the HIRD will also be conducted. Following the launch of EZG, epilepsy patients initiating AED monotherapy with EZG as well as non-epilepsy patients initiating EZG for another disease will be followed until the earliest of an episode of UR, change in their AED regimen (if applicable), end of follow-up, or end of study. The incidence of UR during exposure to EZG under circumstances not indicated in the product label will be described. A descriptive analysis of the patients will also be included.  To meet the other secondary objective, non-EZG AED monotherapy users will be identified in the prospective cohort and incidence of UR will be calculated to determine if there is a difference in UR risk between monotherapy and polytherapy AED use.
Assessment of Renal Vasculature and Function With Ferumoxytol-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is typically performed with extracellular gadolinium chelates, which is often limited in patients with CKD owing to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Ferumoxytol, a novel contrast medium, can be used as an "off-label" contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. During the last decade, ferumoxytol has gained appeal as an MRI contrast agent in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates \<30mL/min and there are reports in the literature for its safe use and utility in both adult and pediatric patients with CKD. The study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients suspected of renal artery stenosis, investigate the correlation between renal cortical T2\*(T2\*=1/R2\*) and renal function, and develop an automatic algorithms for renal vessel segmentation.
Study of the Function and Muscle Metabolism in Drepanocytose Affected Patient During a Moderate Intensity Exercise Drepanocytose disease is the first genetic disease in the world. It results in the synthesis of an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), which in its deoxygenated form, polymerizes and leads to structural changes of red blood cells (RBC) which then take the shape of a sickle, become more fragile, more rigid and less deformable. The fragility of GR sickle causes their mass destruction, leading to chronic anemia (i.e. low levels of GR in the blood) associated with low tissue oxygenation. More rigid and less deformable, sickle GR tend to hang in the microvessels, leading to vaso-occlusive crises (CVO) particularly painful, can cause the failure of certain organs (spleen, kidneys, brain, lung, heart, liver , bone ...) and to life-threatening patients. Preliminary studies conducted on patients with drepanocytose disease (HbSS) have demonstrated changes of muscle tissue indicating a possible failure in the supply and use of oxygen. To date, the translation of this metabolic remodeling in the muscle work is not known.  This project's main objective is to evaluate muscle function in drepanocytose attempted patients. We hypothesized that muscle remodeling associated with sickle cell disease have a functional impact on strength and muscle metabolism. The main objective is to characterize the maximal voluntary plantar flexor muscles. The criteria for these targets will be based on the comparison between healthy subjects, carriers of the sickle cell trait (HbAS) and sickle cell patients (HbSS) oxygen saturation.  The strictly non-invasive approach proposed in this project will study the functional parameters of the muscle of sickle cell disease and the possible link with the clinical manifestations of the disease, including vaso-occlusive crisis, in which tissue oxygenation and pH plays a major role.

High Flow Nasal Oxygen at Extubation for Adults Requiring a Breathing Tube for Treating Severe Breathing Difficulties The goal of this feasibility study is to learn whether a new approach to breathing tube removal within the Intensive Care Unit is safe and acceptable to participants who require a breathing tube for the management of severe breathing difficulties. The main questions it aims to answer are:  * What is the recruitment rate to the study over 12 months? * Is the study design acceptable and safe to participants?  Participants will receive high flow nasal oxygen before their breathing tube is removed. The investigators will compare this with standard practice of applying conventional, low-flow oxygen after the breathing tube removed to see if this effects the rate of repeat breathing tube insertion.  The investigators hypothesise that they will recruit 30 participants to the study protocol (15 participants in each group) over 12 months and that our study protocol will be tolerable and acceptable to participants.
Nutrient Support to Body Composition and Healthy Ageing The focus is healthy ageing, i.e. delaying the deterioration in health status in older adults. Loss of lean tissue (skeletal muscle) mass, a process termed sarcopenia, or bone tissue mass, a process called osteopenia, is a consequence of aging per se, modified by nutrition and lifestyle behaviour.  The aim is to conduct a study of body composition, physical activity, muscle function and ability to undertake activities of daily living in older Irish men and women and to investigate the effect of a six month period of nutrient support, or nutrient plus physical activity on lean tissue mass and function and bone mass in men and women aged 50 to 70 years.
Neuroimaging for Depression The investigators seek to determine whether brain imaging techniques can be used to help detect depression, assess its severity, and/or monitor or predict responses to treatment. Subjects with minor or major depression will be randomly assigned to a wait-list control group or to treatment with a new computer-based cognitive behavior therapy developed by Dr. James Cartriene. Brain imaging will be performed before and during treatment using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The investigators hypothesize that brain activity, particularly in the lateral frontal areas of the brain, will provide biomarkers for depression, depression severity, and treatment response.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Mild Cognitive Impairment Dementia is a very frequent cognitive disorder among elderly individuals. Its prevalence is about 15-20% of the population over the age of 65. The most common forms of dementia among the elderly demented patients are Alzheimer's disease (AD) (prevalence of 70%) and Vascular dementia (VD) (prevalence of about 30-40%).There is also a high rate (about 40%) of coexisting of AD and VD among the dementia patients, defined as mixed dementia.  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a pre-dementia phase of cognitive decline. It is also considered as a prodromal phase of both VD and AD. Its basic clinical features include: cognitive concern, reflecting a change in cognition, reported by the patient or informant (i.e., historical or observed evidence of decline over time), with objective evidence of impairment in one or more cognitive domains (i.e., by formal cognitive testing), as well as preservation of independence in functional abilities and not being demented (i.e., no significant impairment social or occupational functioning).  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been investigated for treatment of numerous diseases for more than 300 years. The principal effect of HBOT is increasing the solubility of oxygen in plasma to a level sufficient to support tissues with minimal oxygen supply carried on by hemoglobin. Clinical studies published this year present convincing evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be the coveted neurotherapeutic method for brain repair. Thus, it seems that HBOT might be an efficient and clinically feasible method capable of increasing tissue/cellular oxygenation and effectively evoking neuroplasticity in the chronically vascular-lesioned areas during the post microvascular lesion phase.  This is a prospective, randomized, control crossed over, study evaluating the effect of HBOT in patients suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment and Vascular Subcortical Ischemia.
Ephedrine Versus Ondansetron During Cesarean Delivery More than 30% of the patients receiving spinal anesthesia develop hypotension.

Exploring Biomarkers Predicting the Outcome of Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an ailment with high incidence of multiorgan failure (MOF) and consequent mortality. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) could subdue systemic inflammation and alleviate liver injury in mice model. However, there are no studies evaluating PGE2 as a predictor of early mortality.This study is designed to investigate whether plasma PGE2 and its receptors are associated with development of MOF and predict short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. By the way, we will also measure several other potential predictive factors (C-reactive protein,severe hyponatremia, Second infections,Diabetes mellitus,High density lipoprotein,interleukin-10,serum bile acids,ferritin,the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio,soluable urokinase plasminogen activator receptor,vWF-Ag levels and FVIII-to-PC ratios).

Arm Exercise Capacity and Maximal Oxygen Consumption With Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide. The incidence rate has reached approximately 16%. According to 2016 data from the Ministry of Health, the incidence of breast cancer in Turkey is 46.8 per 100,000 people and approximately 17,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. While breast cancer survival rate is 80% in developed countries, this rate varies between 40-60% in low-middle income countries. Survival can be increased with early diagnosis and more effective treatment methods. However, a wide range of treatment-related complications are observed during and/or after breast cancer treatment. Cancer survivors are exposed to a variety of direct (local/regional therapy, systemic therapy and supportive care) and indirect factors (modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors) that can have adverse effects on pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic and musculoskeletal components. Oxygen consumption in cancer patients may be adversely affected by aging, deconditioning, existing comorbidities, cancer pathophysiology and cancer treatments (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy). Although decreased functional capacity is common after breast cancer treatment, there are few studies evaluating maximal arm exercise capacity with oxygen consumption.
Follow-up Evaluation of Home Nurse Visitation Program for Socially Disadvantaged Women and Their Children This study will evaluate the long-term effects of a prenatal and early childhood home nurse visitation program for socially disadvantaged women and their children.
Infectious Diseases in Aged Population The increasing number of persons \>65 years of age form a special population at risk for nosocomial and other health care-associated infections. The vulnerability of this age group is related to impaired host defenses such as diminished cell-mediated immunity. Lifestyle considerations, e.g., travel and living arrangements, and residence in nursing homes, can further complicate the clinical picture. The magnitude and diversity of health care-associated infections in the aging population are generating new arenas for prevention and control efforts.  Common infections leading to hospitalizations in this age group result in respiratory infections and bacteraemia and the impact of these infections on the quality of life and disability in aged populations has not been accurately quantified in a European setting.  This study aims to capture and quantify the impact of infectious diseases on quality of life in an aged population.

Bevacizumab and Temozolomide or Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation and Carboplatin in Treating Patients With Stage IV Malignant Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether bevacizumab is more effective when given together with temozolomide or paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin in killing malignant melanoma cells.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving temozolomide together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works compared with giving bevacizumab together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin in treating patients with stage IV malignant melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.
Comparison of Gum® HydralTM Moisturizing Gel and Biotene® Oral Gel in Dry Mouth Sensation Reduction Background. Xerostomia is estimated to affect up to 50% of the adult population and especially the elderly suffer from dry mouth sensation. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of GUM® Hydral® Moisturizing Gel and Biotene® Oral Balance Gel in dry mouth sensation reduction.  Study design and Methods. Forty patients, reporting dry mouth sensation between 4 to 10 on a 0 (no discomfort) to 10 (extreme discomfort) scale, were divided in two parallel groups respectively treated with GUM® Hydral® and Biotene® Gel following a stratified randomization list (t0). Patients and the research assistants were blinded to group assignment. Patients underwent measurements of unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow and weekly (t1, t2, t3, t4) were asked to fill in a patient questionnaire and daily a journal to evaluate the dry mouth symptoms and the subjective perception of changes in the symptoms during one month of treatment. After data collection (t1-t4), patients were medically followed over the next six months in order to detect any long-term side effects (t5).
A Multidisciplinary Approach to Assessing and Treating Fatigue in Inflammatory Bowel Disease This study is examining fatigue in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD includes Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease. These are inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and are associated with symptoms including diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. Fatigue is a common problem for patents with IBD, affecting 80% of patients with active disease.This study aims to identify all IBD patients with fatigue. Initially, the investigators will address all medical causes of fatigue in line with current practice, using a stepwise approach (e.g. assessing for and treating active inflammation, anaemia as well as electrolyte, hormone and vitamin imbalances). The aim is to treat fatigue using a detailed algorithm, as fatigue is often a consequence of multiple issues in IBD patients. The investigators will assess the role of physical activity, nutritional status and psychological wellbeing in fatigue persisting in medically-optimised IBD patients. In addition, the contribution of the microbiome to fatigue will be assessed. For those in whom these factors are identified alongside persistent fatigue, interventions have been designed to address these factors and the resulting fatigue.

Radiotherapy 3 vs 6 Gy in Gonarthrosis and Coxarthrosis This is a non-inferiority study in which the investigators compare two low-dose radiotherapy schemes, which are recommended from DEGRO Clinical Practice Guidelines (3 Gy vs 6 Gy) for the treatment of osteoarthritis and other osteodegenerative disorders.  A first randomization will be carried out among the patients included in the study:  * Patients in arm A will be treated at 3 Gy (0.5 Gy/fraction, 3 fractions/week), and patients in arm B will be treated at 6 Gy (1 Gy/fraction, 3 fractions/week). * Patients should not know the arm to which they have been randomized. * Once the treatment is finished, patients will be assessed at 8 weeks. If pain does not improve, a re-irradiation will be performed. If the patients were treated with 3 Gy a new randomization will be performed (3 vs 6 Gy again). If the patiens were treated with 6 Gy they will be re-irradiated with 6 Gy again.  The investigators will analyze the results obtained depending on the dose received and depending on the location of the treatment.
The Role of Ghrelin in Cancer Cachexia Cancer is often coupled with a condition called cachexia. In this condition, individuals continue to lose weight and lean body mass, which means their muscles are getting smaller and weaker. Studies have shown that cancer patients who are losing weight often are responding poorly to chemotherapy, are at greater risk of infection and have a reduced life expectancy. Also, people may not want to eat. To date, there are no approved treatments available for this condition.  This study is going to study the benefits of the use of the study drug, Anamorelin hydrochloride (HCl) in treatment or prevention of cachexia associated with cancer. Studies done before with the study drug have shown that the drug can help the cachectic condition. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Anamorelin HCl compared to placebo on body composition (amount of cell mass, fat, muscle, etc.) including measurements of body potassium and nitrogen stores.

Classification of the Sagittal Profile of the Spine in Asymptomatic Elderly Subjects Principal aim The main purpose of the study is to describe the distribution of the sagittal profile in elderly subjects in order to bridge the gap present in this type of screening, evaluated in the literature for adults only (i.e. 160 subjects considered by Roussouly et al. in 2005). This classification assigns an integer value from 1 to 4 in relation to the evaluation of alignment of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane. The population description is therefore divided into four categories. The extension of this classification to elderly can provide useful support for the clinical evaluation and the specific treatment of the elderly patients.  Secondary aims The study aims in addition to evaluate the relation between the spine sagittal profile and the objective indexes obtained from the assessment of fall-risk and gait cycle analysis. Accordingly, a subgroup of 40 subjects out of the 160 will be evaluated. This subgroup will consider the subjects older than or equal to 74 years, where the risk of falling is most likely to be expected.

Polatuzumab Vedotin and Combination Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Previously Untreated Lymphoma This phase II trial studies how well polatuzumab vedotin and combination chemotherapy work in treating patients with previously untreated double, triple hit lymphoma, Double Expressor Lymphoma or High-Grade B Cell Lymphoma. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding with cancer cells and releasing another chemotherapy drug, called monomethyl auristatin E, into the cell causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing. Chemotherapy drugs, such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving polatuzumab vedotin with combination chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with double or triple hit lymphoma compared to combination chemotherapy alone.

Empagliflozin to Prevent Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation This is an interventional, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial with allocation sequence concealment and blinded endpoint adjudication. The goal of present study is to investigate if periprocedural administration of 10 mg once daily empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2I), can reduce the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter in patients with chronic coronary syndrome scheduled for isolated CABG. This trial will be conducted in two referral teaching cardiology hospitals in Tehran. 492 adult patients who are scheduled for elective isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery will be randomly assigned to one of the groups of intervention (empagliflozin 10 mg daily) or placebo starting 3 days before surgery until discharge.
Pazopanib in Combination With Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Angiogenesis is essential for the growth of large tumor. A number of anti-angiogenic agents are currently under development. Bevacizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown to improve disease free survival in first line metastatic breast cancer when associated with chemotherapy 1. Results of a randomised phase II trial combining sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases including VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, with capecitabine have recently been reported 2. Compared to capecitabine plus placebo, progression-free survival in the capecitabine + sorafenib arm was significantly increased from 4.1 months to 6.4 months. Toxicities were also increased, with an incidence rate of grade 3/4 hand foot syndrome of 45% in the capecitabine + sorafenib arm compared to 13% in the capecitabine + placebo arm. The increased toxicity will most likely limit the clinical use of this regimen.  Pazopanib is a potent, multi-targeted TKI of VEGFR-1, -2, -3, PDGFR-α and -β and c-kit and has recently been approved for the treatment of renal cell cancer in the U.S. In the EU, a positive opinion has been issued by the European Medicines Agency.  A phase II study of GW786034 (pazopanib) in patients with recurrent or metastatic invasive breast carcinoma included 19 patients after a maximum of 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease 3. Pazopanib 800 mg daily was given continuously.  A clinically significant rate of stable disease (58%) was detected with a median TTP of 5.3 months (95% CI: 1.8 - 9.0 months). Four patients treated with pazopanib had SD for ≥ 6 months, for a clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as rate of SD for ≥ 6 months or CR or PR, of 5/19 (26%), which is at least comparable to sunitinib and bevacizumab (CBR 16% and 17%, respectively).  The pivotal study of full dose (800 mg) daily pazopanib in renal cell cancer reported hand foot syndrome of all grades in only 6% of patients 4. The optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) of pazopanib was determined when administered in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced CRC 5. In patients who received capecitabine (850 mg twice daily) plus 800 mg once daily pazopanib combined with oxaliplatin, the incidence of hand foot syndrome of all grades was 24%.  The present study will investigate the combination of pazopanib and capecitabine in advanced or metastatic breast cancer with the aim to develop a new treatment option with increased efficacy and tolerability.
Physiology of GIP(1-30)NH2 in Humans Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is a gut-derived incretin hormone that affects glucose, lipid and bone metabolism. Secretion of GIP into the blood stream from enteroendocrine cells is stimulated bu nutrients in the gut lumen and results in potentiation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion from the pancreas. The objective of this study is to investigate the physiology of GIP(1-30)NH2 in humans with insulin secretion as the primary endpoint. Furthermore the effects on on plasma/serum levels of glucagon, C-peptide, glucose, bone markers (CTX and P1NP) will be measured.

The Effect of Intraoperative Labetalol on Time to Discharge Patients coming for surgery often receive opioid medications, like fentanyl, to treat pain. Opioids however have many unpleasant side effects including nausea and vomiting, itching, sedation, and decreased breathing. During laparoscopic surgery increases in heart and blood pressure are often attributed to pain. It has been shown that by treating these changes with medications such as esmolol, instead of opioids, side effects and time to discharge from hospital can be reduced. Labetalol is a drug that is similar to esmolol but may have advantages over it. It is more effective at controlling both heart rate and blood pressure and it is easier and less costly to use. This study is investigating labetalol in patients having laparoscopic gallbladder surgery and comparing it to esmolol and fentanyl. Patients will be treated with one of these drugs during surgery to control heart rate and blood pressure and the effects on time to discharge, pain scores, frequency of side effects, and narcotic requirements will be observed in the recovery room. It is thought that labetalol will be shown to be as effective as esmolol and that both drugs that minimize fentanyl will show reduced time to discharge, fewer side effects, and effective treatment of heart rate and blood pressure.
Synergism of Immunomodulation and Tumor Ablation This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center early phase II study. This proof of concept study will investigate whether the combined use of local tumor ablation/radiation plus immunomodulating drugs may induce a significant immune response in patient with incurable liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) (+/- limited extrahepatic disease) being stable or in partial remission after completion of 4-6 months first line systemic therapy.  The primary objective of the study is to show an overall response rate of lesions not treated by ablation/radiotherapy including the extrahepatic lesions (according to iRECIST criteria) higher than 10%. With the continuation of first line systemic treatment, no further responses are expected.  Secondary objectives are:  * To establish the feasibility and safety of the combined treatment modalities; * To study the impact of the local technique (RFA/Radiotherapy) on the results; * To investigate biomarkers to predict response to the combined treatment
Oral FMT (Fecal Microbial Transplant) in Subjects With Multiple Sclerosis The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether fecal microbial transplant (FMT) has the potential to be an effective, safe and tolerable therapy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The investigators plan to gather preliminary data in a small cohort of 10 to 15 adults with MS.
The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Activity Gene Expression (SAGE) Study The goal of this study is to enable the study sponsor to develop a new blood test method for clinicians to accurately predict which individuals with lupus will flare, when the flare will occur, and flare severity. Ultimately such a newly derived test would allow treating physicians to start pre-emptive therapy early, with the goal of achieving remission quickly and with a shorter duration of treatment; identify individuals who will have less severe flares and will thus require less aggressive treatments; or intensify and lengthen treatment for those individuals who will need such therapy.  The design of this study is to follow individuals with a known diagnosis of SLE for changes in disease activity during the course of one year of observation. Clinical data and blood and urine samples will be collected at scheduled monthly visits. The clinical data and blood samples will be used for identifying gene expression profile(s) that are associated with increases in SLE disease activity (lupus "flares").
Comparison of Coenzyme A and Pantethine Capsule for Safety and Efficacy On Patients With Hyperlipidemia The purpose of this study is to compare the lipid lowering effects and clinical safety of a natural hypolipidemic compound, coenzyme A capsule with a marketed drug, Pantethine Capsule, in Chinese patients with moderate dyslipidemia.
Diagnostic Potential of UCHL1 in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Autophagy is considered an important component of Heart failure progression. Deubiquitination enzymes play an important role in autophagy. An important regulatory process within the autophagy pathway is ubiquitination. Ubiquitination targets proteins for degradation. On the contrary, de-ubiquitinating proteins (such as UCHL1) reverses this process. Studies have demonstrated deubiquitination to be linked to certain pathological processes, such as heart failure. UCHL1 will be examined as a potential marker of disease progression in acute decompensated heart failure.
Patient Blood Management Program in Total Hip or Total Knee Arthroplasty Total hip and knee arthroplasty are among the most common surgical procedures for which blood transfusion is prescribed. Patient blood management program has been proposed to decrease the need for transfusion. This program involve three pillars: preoperative improvement of erythropoiesis, intraoperative reduction of bleeding and postoperative management of anemia.  Among the different steps of this program, reduction of bleeding and optimization of anemia are gaining popularity, but preoperative improvement of erythropoiesis is underused. The preoperative step of the blood management program is not systematically used because it requires a complex organization, is considered expensive, and finally because the others available techniques to reduce blood transfusion are easier to implement.  The aim of this study was to assess, within a patient blood management program, the effectiveness of erythropoietin on reducing allogenic blood transfusion and anemia in patients requiring elective total hip or knee arthroplasty. "

Dose-Ranging Study of BAY 59-7939 on the Prevention of VTE in Patients Undergoing Elective Total Hip Replacement Patients undergoing surgery, especially hip and knee surgery, are at high risk for VTE. The administration of drugs for thromboprophylaxis, such as heparins, significantly lowers that risk, but heparins have to be applied by injections below the skin. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of BAY 59-7939 with the safety and efficacy of the licensed drug enoxaparin and to find the optimal dose of BAY 59-7939 for the anticipated phase III trials. Enoxaparin, a so-called low molecular weight heparin, is approved and widely used in the area of thromboprophylaxis and was given once daily subcutaneously. In this study 5 different doses of the investigational drug BAY 59-7939 were tested in comparison to Enoxaparin. The following doses of BAY 59-7939 were tested: 2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose); 5 mg twice daily (10 mg total daily dose), 10 mg twice daily (20 mg total daily dose), 20 mg twice daily (40 mg total daily dose) and 30 mg twice daily ( 60 mg total daily dose). This study ran for approximately 7 months in a number of countries. In total, 726 patients were enrolled in this study.
Omega-3 and Vitamin D Supplements in Childhood T1D The study was conducted in 64 patients with T1D of which 26 had the onset in 2017, and 38 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. All received vitamin D 1000 IU /day since disease's onset. Moreover in the 2017 group omega-3 were supplemented, starting within 3 and 6 months from the disease's outbreak, and those were considered cases; the other 38 were enrolled as controls. Four cases and one control dropped out. Finally in 59/64 were compared data of glycosylated hemoglobin percentage (HbA1c%), average insulin daily requirement (IU/Kg/day), and IDAA1c \[Insulin Daily dose Adjusted for HbA1c, a surrogate index of residual endogen insulin secretion, calculated as insulin daily dose (IU/Kg/24 h) x 4 + HbA1c%\] at recruitment (T0), and 3 (T3), 6 (T6), 12 (T12) months after. T0 in cases was at the start of supplementation of omega-3, and consequently 3, 6 and 12 months after; in controls were found data in clinical records of outpatient beginning from the 3rd month and 3-6-12 months thereafter. Then 22 cases and 37 controls were compared.

Rate and mortality were compared among three time periods: 2000-2004, 2005-2009 and 2010-2015.
Prevention of Irinotecan Induced Diarrhea by Probiotics Irinotecan is one of key drug used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The incidence of irinotecan induced diarrhea varies between 60-90%, with severe diarrhea in 20-40%. The main cause of diarrhea is one of irinotecan metabolites, SN-38 which is in the liver glucuronidated and subsequently expelled into the intestine. Due to the bacterial enzyme beta-D-glucuronidase in intestinal lumen it is deconjugated. This form causes direct damage of intestinal mucosa associated with malabsorption and the development of diarrhea. It is known that probiotic bacteria, reduce activity of intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase and therefore these bacteria could be applied in the prevention of diarrhea in patients treated by this food supplement. Given their low toxicity, good tolerability, probiotics may be an important part of supportive therapy. This is a first study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the probiotics in the prophylaxis of irinotecan induced diarrhea due to reduction intestinal beta-D-glucuronidase activity.

Preventive Intervention in Nursery School Teachers Childcare in nursery schools has been shown to be associated with an elevated prevalence of neck, shoulder, arm and low back disorders. The current evidence suggests that exercises seem to be the only effective preventive intervention. Thus the purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an extension-oriented exercise program in preventing low back/neck pain and functional disability in nursery school teachers. In addition, the investigators also sought to identify the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints in this category of workers.
A Program to Reduce Inappropriate Medications Among Older Adults With Alzheimer's Disease Potentially inappropriate prescribing includes the use of medications that may no longer be necessary or that may increase the risk of harm. Inappropriate prescribing can increase the overall symptom burden, and negatively affect health-related quality of life and function. The inappropriate prescription of certain drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, and strong anticholinergic agents poses particular risks for older adults, and may be more common among those with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease- related dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and more frequent prescription of five or more medications. The D-PRESCRIBE-AD (Developing a PRogram to Educate and Sensitize Caregivers to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with Alzheimer's Disease) study will test a health plan-based intervention using the NIH Collaboratory's Distributed Research Network, which employs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel System infrastructure. The overarching goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a patient/caregiver- centered, multifaceted educational intervention on potentially inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. The research hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their providers can reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and improve medication safety for this vulnerable population. The study population will include community-dwelling patients with AD/ADRD, identified based on diagnoses codes of AD/ADRD or use of a medication for Alzheimer's Disease, who have evidence of potentially inappropriate prescribing the three drug classes above. The trial will evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed to spur patient/caregiver-provider communication about medication safety (versus usual care) on the proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing, the primary outcome of this study. The trial will be conducted in two large, national health plans.

Entheogen Resurgence For the purpose of this anonymous, observational pilot survey, the investigators will define "entheogens" as substances, generally derived from plants, that are ingested in order to impact one's consciousness for therapeutic, religious, or spiritual purposes. This survey will focus on the naturalistic use of entheogens and other substances including kambo, ayahuasca, hapé, bufo, and sananga typically used in specific cultural and spiritual contexts for healing. There are substantial limitations to what the healthcare community knows about the intentions, motivations, experiences, health behaviors, and demographics of people who decide to participate in entheogen therapy centers or retreats and their willingness to participate in future research studies.  The primary goal of this observational pilot survey is to collect self-reported, anonymous data from people who have opted to participate in entheogen therapy centers and retreats during the last five (5) years on the topics of their initial intentions, motivations, experiences, demographics, and willingness to participate in future entheogen research.  With the support of established therapy and retreat centers, the research team will aim to collect 100 survey responses from unique, unidentified individuals who have participated in some form of entheogen therapy or treatment during the last five (5) years. Those who choose to fill out the survey will be at least 18 years of age, fluent in English, and self-reporting participation in therapy or a retreat which utilized entheogens in a naturalistic setting in the past five (5) years.
Microbiome Shift in Peri-mucositis by Anti-inflammatory Drugs Dental implants are often used to replace missing teeth. In fact, in the US over 700,000 implants are places every year and over 2 million implants are places world wide. Peri-implant mucositis in an inflammatory condition affecting dental implants and is recognized as a risk factor for peri-implantitis (a condition affecting the bone around implants and eventually leading to implant loss). The prevalence of Peri-implant Mucositis has been reported in the literature to range from 50-90% whereas the prevalence of Peri-implantitis has been reported as high as 20%. it is commonly believed that a dysbiotic microbiome is the primary cause for these conditions.  The inflammatory burden around diseased implants creates a high-protein environment which is necessary for the survival of pathogenic bacteria. It is logical, therefore, that reducing inflammation by Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) may create a shift in the dysbiotic microbiome to a symbiotic microbiome. The aim of the current study is to test the effects of oral NSAIDs on the peri-implant microbiome.
Early Postoperative Administration of Oxycodone +/- Naloxone and Duration of Epidural Analgesia Cystectomy with urinary diversion (ileal conduit, ileal orthotopic neobladder, catheterizable ileal pouch) is major abdominal surgery, which is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal complications.Perioperative techniques aiming at an early return of bowel function are to be pursued.  Optimal postoperative pain management is one of the key factors leading to enhanced recovery after surgery. The perioperative use of an epidural analgesia for major abdominal surgery is established, not only because of its excellent analgesic properties, but also because it can accelerate the return of bowel function. However, epidural analgesia is associated with additional costs, need for close monitoring and nursing. In addition each supplemental day with an indwelling epidural catheter increases the risk of infection. So it is recommended to re-assess the risk/benefit ratio of an epidural analgesia after 4 days, if not sooner. Therefore, it is important to develop strategies that reduce its duration without impairing the benefits. Systemic analgesics with prolonged-release oral formulation like oral oxycodone (Oxycontin®) or combined drug mixture (oral oxycodone/naloxone (Targin®)) could be a valuable alternative pain treatment as a second analgesic step, starting on postoperative day (POD) 3, so that the epidural catheter could be removed earlier without impairing postoperative enhanced recovery including return of the bowel function. Both oxycodone and naloxone orally administered are a recognized and accepted treatment option.  The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of an oral opioid with or without naloxone in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy with urinary diversion and intraoperative and early postoperative use of epidural analgesia. The investigators expect an unchanged early return of the bowel function and equal analgesia with a reduced length of stay of the epidural catheter (primary endpoint), thus potentially reducing epidural catheter associated complications and lowering costs (nursing and pain service).

Identifying Stress Urinary Incontinence in Women With Pelvic Organ Prolapse What test is most sensitive in identifying stress urinary incontinence in women with pelvic organ prolapse; urodynamics, cough stress test, or pyridium pad test? The hypothesis states that there is a difference between the sensitivity of UDS, pyridium pad test and cough stress tests, with UDS being the most sensitive and the gold standard in identifying SUI in patients with pelvic organ prolapse.
Comparison of Anticoagulation Prolongation vs. no Anticoagulation in STEMI Patients After Primary PCI The RIGHT study is a large randomized study dedicated to post-PPCI anticoagulation in STEMI patients. The investigators propose to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of anticoagulation prolonged for at least 48 hours after the procedure vs. no prolongation of anticoagulation after procedure in patients with STEMI treated with bivalirudin during PPCI (primary hypothesis). When allocated to anticoagulation prolongation by randomization, the subject will be assigned to UFH, enoxaparin or bivalirudin (same regimen allocated by centre) for at least 48 hours after PPCI. The results from this study are expected to provide guidance on the risk/benefit of post-procedural anticoagulation in patients with STEMI.

Efficacy of Wheelchair Skills Training on Confidence Using a Manual Wheelchair Background and Rationale: Mobility impairment is one of the main correlates of decreased levels of participation in daily and social activities. Mobility disability is often remediable through the use of assistive technology, of which the wheelchair is arguably the most widely used and recognizable form. Statistics suggest over 250,000 Canadians use wheelchairs, the majority of whom are older adults.  Mobility impairment often has psychological consequences that may independently restrict functioning and participation. Confidence is one such consequence, and according to Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, is the belief individuals have in their ability to perform behaviours to achieve desired outcomes. Furthermore, previous findings have accounted for no more than 40% of the variance of factors influencing wheelchair mobility and participation. It is likely that confidence in wheelchair use may account for some of that variance. Recent findings show that approximately 40% of wheelchair users report having low confidence.  Because confidence is client-specific and modifiable, treatment strategies to address low confidence in using a wheelchair may lead to greater participation among older adults.  Purpose: The overall goal of this research project is to evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on confidence with using a manual wheelchair in a group of non-wheelchair users.  Objectives:  1. Evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on improving confidence with using a manual wheelchair. 2. Evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program on improving wheelchair performance. 3. Explore the immediate effect of exposure to wheelchair skills (an outcome measure) on confidence using a manual wheelchair.  Hypotheses:  1. Participants who take part in the Wheelchair Skills Training Program will have significant improvements in confidence with using a manual wheelchair compared with those in the control group, as measured by the Wheelchair Use Confidence Scale (WheelCon) 2. Participants who receive the Wheelchair Skills Training Program will have significant improvements in wheelchair performance compared to the control group, as measured by the Wheelchair Skills Test (WST). 3. All participants will have significant improvements in confidence using a manual wheelchair after exposure to wheelchair skills (during baseline assessment).  Research Method: This study will use 2 concurrent Randomized Controlled Trials to evaluate the efficacy of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program in younger and older adults. Trial 1 and Trial 2 will employ different recruitment approaches for targeting younger versus older adults and different inclusion criteria with regard to age of the participants. Otherwise the research design, protocol and procedures will be the same. Upon completion of data collection, the data will be pooled and stratified by age (younger adult, older adult) for analyses.

Alternative Paracetamol Treatments for the Neonate With a hsPDA Early targeted treatment of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) during the first week of life in preterm neonates is often recommended. Our standard first line therapeutic approach is enteral acetaminophen. However many extremely low birth weight infants may be on limited or no feeds when PDA closure is determined to be indicated, thus restricting the use of enteral acetaminophen. Several studies have suggested that intravenous acetaminophen is less effective than enteral. Thus, in this study, we propose to compare two alternative modes of administration when enteral acetaminophen is not an option.
Rapid Screening Phenotype Test To Evaluate CYP 2C19 Enzyme Activity Using Stable Isotope [13C]Pantoprazole The purpose of this study is to determine the function of an enzyme that breaks down drugs and helps the removal of drugs from your body. This enzyme is called cytochrome P450 2C19 and is located in your liver. Exposure to other medications or variations in genes that you have inherited from your parents, may speed up or slow the function of this enzyme. As a result, some patients may develop unwanted effects from a drug while some other patients may not get benefit from taking the same drug. The aim of this study is to determine the function of this enzyme in your liver. We will do this by performing a series of breath tests and blood samples after you take pantoprazole. Pantoprazole is approved as an oral and intravenous drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Lumbar Paravertebral in Hernia Surgery An inguinal hernia is one of the most common disorders requiring surgical repair in pediatrics. The effective treatment of postoperative pain in infants and children is challenging. Although the use of opioid analgesics is generally safe, adverse effects occur frequently, so the use of alternative analgesic techniques when available to improve postoperative analgesia while limiting opioid-related adverse effects, that is why there is an increase in the use of regional anesthetic techniques in infants and children.
EUS-guided Intratumoral Gemcitabine in Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer Pancreatic cancer is the 11th most common type of cancer but it is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. The only effective treatment for pancreatic cancer includes surgery. However, only 20% of the patients have surgically treatable disease. Also, the 5-year survival for the surgically treated patients is only 15%.  About 40% of the patients present with advanced disease with distant metastasis, and the remaining 40% present with locally advanced unresectable cancer with the tumor invaded into surrounding major vessels. For those with locally advanced disease, systemic chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy provides palliation of the symptoms but cannot cure the disorder. Systemic chemotherapy is given through peripheral vessels.  The investigators hypothesized that direct injection of the chemotherapeutic drug into the tumor may help to boost the effect of systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in those with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

The Effect of White and Pink Noise on Hospitalized Older Adults The purpose of this study is to determine if using an over-the-counter, commercially available sleep noise machine playing pink or white noise will reduce the incidence of delirium in hospitalized patients over the age of 65. Delirium is an acute change in cognition which commonly occurs in hospitalized older adults, and is linked with sleep-wake cycle disturbance. Delirium is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as longer hospital stays. This project will record delirium screening scores for those receiving the intervention and comparing them to baseline data. Reducing delirium rates using a noninvasive, inexpensive method in a hospital setting could have a significant impact on patient outcomes and potentially reduce costs associated with longer hospital stays. It is anticipated that white/pink noise played at night will decrease rates of delirium in hospitalized older adults.
Real-time Experiences With Sleep Training Study Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness that often first emerges in adolescence. Effective treatments are typically expensive, lengthy, and intense (e.g., Dialectical Behavior Therapy). Thus, setting individuals up for treatment success is extremely important. Disrupted sleep is closely linked to many BPD symptoms (e.g., moodiness, impulsivity, interpersonal problems), and people with BPD have a range of sleep-related problems. Importantly, sleep problems may make BPD symptoms worse, longer lasting, and also interfere with learning new skills in treatment. Understanding sleep problems in BPD may help create better interventions, as most therapies for BPD do not currently address sleep difficulties. Although approaches like Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and the Youth version of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention (TranS-C-Youth) work well with many populations, scientists don't yet know if youth with BPD features can tolerate a sleep-focused intervention. The investigators will recruit youth between ages 13 and 18 who have 3 or more clinically impairing BPD symptoms from the London community and via clinician referrals. They will also recruit a parent to report on their child's sleep patterns, mental health symptoms, and accompany youth to an intervention session. Participants will complete diagnostic interviews and a range of surveys to assess their current functioning (e.g., sleep, mental health, BPD symptoms). Investigators will also ask youth to report on their BPD symptoms multiple times per day in real time and track their sleep at night for a 10-day period. Participants will also wear a headband to track their brain waves while they sleep. After an initial 10-day monitoring period, youth participants will receive a brief, single-session sleep intervention with their parent using materials from the TranS-C-Youth protocol. Adolescents will be asked to follow a sleep plan created during their visit for three weeks before completing another 10 days of assessment. Participants will complete a follow-up survey battery upon completion of the second real-time survey protocol, and also be invited to complete surveys one-month post intervention. The investigators hypothesize that day-to-day variability in sleep will influence BPD symptom presentation, and vice versa. They also hypothesize that our intervention will improve sleep quantity/quality among an at-risk sample, and may be associated with decreased BPD symptoms relative to baseline.
A Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of BIVV009 (Sutimlimab) in Participants With Primary Cold Agglutinin Disease Without A Recent History of Blood Transfusion The purpose of Part A was to determine whether sutimlimab administration resulted in a greater than or equal to (\>=)1.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) level and avoidance of transfusion in participants with primary cold agglutinin disease (CAD) without a recent history of blood transfusion. The purpose of Part B was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of sutimlimab in participants with primary CAD.
Recurrence in High-grade Lesions After Conization Objectives: To identify factors associated with disease recurrence in patients with high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) undergoing large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).  Study Design: A case-control study that included 103 patients. Patients were included in the study if they had a history of surgery for conization by LLETZ for the histopathological diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades II and III (CIN II and CIN III). Follow-up exams were conducted every six months with Pap smear collection and colposcopic examination with biopsy, when necessary, for a minimum period of twelve months. Cure was defined as a normal follow-up examination within 24 months. During follow-up, relapse occurred when cytology and/or biopsy results showed that CIN had returned after 12 months, at which time a new cervical conization by LLETZ was performed.

Blood-saving Effect of Combined Intravenous Tranexamic Acid With Topical Floseal® Application Total Hip Arthroplasty Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an excellent surgical procedure for patients with end-stage hip diseases. However, THA is associated with considerable blood loss and increasing needs for allogenic blood transfusion. Tranexamic acid (TXA) was reportedly effective reducing total blood loss (TBL) after standard THA. However, a TBL of one L is still high for elderly patients.  Floseal (Baxter, Deerfield, Illinois), a thrombin-based hemostatic agent, have been widely used in surgical procedure. However, there is no study investigating the effect of Floseal in THA procedures.This study anticipated that combination with the two different mechanism of topical hemostatic agent, Floseal, and intravenous TXA can bring a synergistic blood saving effect in THA patients.  Purpose:  Our purpose of this study therefore is to conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial to investigate the blood-conservation effect of combination of intravenous TXA and topical Floseal in a primary THA procedure.  Material and Methods:  The patients who are enrolled in this study will be assigned into three groups. The first group will be treated by combination of 1 g of TXA pre-operatively and two boluses TXA post-operatively intravenously and Floseal topical application, the second group by 1 g of TXA pre-operatively and two boluses TXA postoperatively intravenously without Floseal use, and the third group was control group which will be treated without TXA and Floseal. This study will observe whether there is difference in the blood-conservation effect by total blood loss calculation, hemoglobin loss and transfusion requirement between these three groups.  This study anticipate that combined use of intravenous TXA and Floseal in THA procedure is more effective in decreasing blood loss and blood transfusion than intravenous TXA application alone, and this formula do not increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.
Investigation of Clinical Spectrum, Bacterial Pathogens and Immune Response in Acute Pharyngotonsillitis Acute pharyngotonsillitis is one of the most common infections encountered by pediatricians. Most children with acute pharyngotonsillitis have symptoms that can be attributed to viral infection. However 30-40% of cases is of bacterial etiology.  The purpose of this study is to examine frequency, age distribution, clinical picture and pathogen distribution in acute pharyngotonsillitis in children in a large urban setting.
Comparison Between Medial Pivot Versus Symmetric Insert Total Knee Arthroplasty The functional outcome and longevity of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is still a concern. Despite various developments in TKA designs, including fixed or mobile bearing, cruciate retaining or posterior stabilized, multi or single radius, it remains unclear which design is superior for achieving a physiological kinematic.  In normal healthy knees the medial and lateral tibial condyles are different: the medial is almost flat while the lateral is somewhat convex. Thus, the movement during flexion is asymmetric: during the flexion, the medial condyle is stable throughout the range of motion while the lateral condyle slides anteroposteriorly with respect to femur). Therefore, the native knee requires a specific degree of rollback of the lateral compartment coupled with a medial pivot, which leads to an external axial rotation of the femur. This rollback is thought to be even more pronounced with increasing knee flexion angles to enable deep flexion without excessive shear forces acting at the patella or overloading the extensor mechanism.  In addition, stability throughout flexion is a crucial element to normal knee function. Most TKA designs removal of the ACL, and the PCL in posterior-stabilized design, but the TKA do not fully restore the function of those ligaments.  Based on this philosophy, the medial pivot TKA was designed to provide better function, patient satisfaction and increased survival.  The objective of this study is to analyze whether the medial pivot design provides better outcome and prosthesis survival than conventional total knee arthroplasty.

Selection for the arms of the study is randomized by the study computer. Some will participate in the daily lottery only, some with the reminder system only, some with the reminder system and the daily lottery, and some with neither the lottery nor the reminder system.
Laryngeal Mask Supreme During Laparoscopic Gynecologic Surgery Laryngeal mask (LM) use in gynecological laparoscopy, contrary to widespread opinion, does not increase the incidence of gastric aspiration, the failure of ventilation or the risk of pulmonary aspiration . LM is presented as an alternative to endo tracheal tube (ETT) in spontaneous or positive pressure ventilation (PPV) . LM has gained widespread popularity in England for gynecological laparoscopic procedures. In addition in many previous studies LM has been successfully shown to provide appropriate lung ventilation in laparoscopic surgical interventions .Miller et al. compared the use of ETT, LM-P laparoscopic gynecological interventions and identified advantages to LM use. The most important of these advantages was that, contrary to tracheal tube techniques for laparoscopic surgeries, use of supraglottic laryngeal devices or neuromuscular blocker agents (NBA) were not required during placement. Thus for laparoscopic surgeries, compared with the ETT technique, without the need for supraglottic laryngeal devices or muscular relaxants, it is easily placed and reduces the time spent in the operating room.  Our aim; to compare the use of LM-S and ETT without neuromuscular agents for laparoscopic gynecological intervention with positive pressure ventilation from a surgical viewpoint and in terms of effect on ventilation parameters.

The Biomarkers of Neurological Disease in Utero Study Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are potent teratogens associated with a spectrum of physical and neurodevelopmental anomalies to the exposed fetus. Particular risks include congenital malformations, impaired motor and cognitive functioning, autism and poorer educational attainment. Fetal exposure to drugs that bind to central nervous system targets as part of their therapeutic effect (e.g. neurotransmitter receptors and neuronal channels) appear to alter brain structure and function in both animal models and humans.  Fetal magnetic resonance imaging offers an approach to investigate these effects in vivo, identifying biomarkers, defining the onset of abnormalities and dose response. Fetal MRI may offer risk stratification and identify patients that may benefit from intervention early in development. The overall aim of this study is to contribute to improving developmental outcomes following the inevitable exposure during treatment of maternal epilepsy.  This novel study aims to explore the central nervous system with state-of-the-art non-invasive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging consistent with the University of Nottingham Precision Imaging Beacon, so as to improve outcomes in patients at risk of long term complex neuropsychiatric conditions.
E GFR TKI and EGF-P TI C Ombination in EGFR mutA nt NSCL C This is a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, Phase Ib clinical study. Patients who give informed consent will be screened for the study, including genotyping of the tumour and baseline characteristics. Eligible patients will receive a single pre-treatment of low dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 (Day -3). Patients will commence daily oral therapy with the EGFR TKI afatinib as soon as possible, preferably on the same day as low dose cyclophosphamide. Afatinib will be prescribed according to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the product, and will continue in nominal 21-day cycles for as long as clinically indicated. The first day of dosing with EGF-PTI will be designated Day 1.  Immunisation with EGF-PTI will commence 3 days after low dose cyclophosphamide and commencement of EGFR TKI, and will be repeated on Day 14, Day 28, Day 43, and Day 92. After the 5 th vaccination, patients will be followed up every 6 weeks for basic safety data and every 3 months for complete efficacy data, safety data, and maintenance (reduced) doses of EGF-PTI. Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, death, safety concerns (in the opinion of the investigator), non-compliance with the protocol, the patient withdraws from the study, 1 year after randomisation of the last patient, or the study is stopped the sponsor, whichever occurs sooner
Effects of Neurodynamics on Lower Extremity Spasticity - a Study in Chronic Stroke Post-stroke spasticity in the lower extremity affects balance and gait, leading to decreased mobility and functional independence. Therefore, effective intervention for reducing spasticity is crucial in stroke rehabilitation. Recently, neurodynamics, though originally designed for pain management in orthopedic patients, has also been applied for treating spasticity in patients with neurological disorders. However, previous studies focused mainly on treating the upper extremity spasticity, but not on lower extremity spasticity, and not on possible neurophysiological changes. The present study aims to investigate the immediate effects of neurodynamics in reducing lower limb spasticity and neurophysiological changes in people with chronic stroke.
Vegetable Intake Effect on Heterocyclic Amine Metabolism This is a randomized trial with crossover design, where each participant will undergo four study phases with a different test meal at the end of each phase.

The participants will refrain from meat products for 24 hours prior to the test meal. On day seven of each phase and after an overnight fast, subjects will be randomly assigned to eat one of four meals:  1. grilled hamburger with no vegetables 2. grilled hamburger with steamed broccoli and Brussels sprouts 3. grilled hamburger with steamed parsnips, fresh parsley, and celery sticks 4. grilled hamburger with steamed broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and parsnips plus fresh parsley and celery sticks.
Relation Between Psychoactive Drugs Overdosage and Severity of Falls in Elderly People There are many epidemiological data on the relationship between the number or nature of psychoactive medications used and the risk of falling in elderly, but very little on the relationship between the amount of psychoactive medication actually present in the blood and the severity of the fall. However, the inevitable drug-drug interactions related to polypharmacy and the pharmacokinetic modifications related to old age may lead plasma overdose situations which can potentiate the risk of falls but also aggravate these consequences. The investigators therefore propose a study with the objective of verifying whether the proportion of falls with serious traumatic consequences is more frequent in patients over 75 years old, presenting plasma overdoses of psychoactive drugs (plasma concentrations higher than the usual therapeutic concentrations) in regard to those between therapeutic ranges.  The aim of this work is to verify if the falls present more severe characters when the psychoactive drug concentrations are beyond the usual therapeutic ranges.
EpiConCES - Epidural Lidocaine for Conversion to CaEsarean Section The need to resort to a midwifery course work in cesarean is a common practice. Epidural analgesia for labor analgesia is practiced in 90% of women in obstetric work, as when the cesarean decision is taken course work in practice and the recommendations are to use the epidural catheter in place to convert the epidural analgesia in epidural anesthesia by re-injecting a local anesthetic on the catheter. General anesthesia is reserved only cases of extreme urgency and cons-indications for regional anesthesia as a purveyor of high maternal morbidity and mortality.  The initial assumption is that the 2% lidocaine with epinephrine is the optimal and recommended local anesthetic solution.
Triceps Range of Motion Exercise on Shooting Accuracy Theories support that nearly all the movements performed by athletes- from rebounding to steal the basketball, to riding a bicycle occur within a small range of motion and training in partial range can improve the isometric strength within the range of motion which it is trained and also increase the full range of motion (FROM) strength as well. The best training method to improve the shooting accuracy among basketball players remains unclear, despite the numerous training methods being available. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of tricpes full range of motion vs triceps partial range of motion training on shooting accuracy among recreational basket ball players. The previous research has mostly focused on measuring the isokinetic strength at different speed in relation to shooting accuracy and there is limited research which has explored the triceps strength using partial range exercise.
Trial for Single Port Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Colectomy This study aims to compare the outcomes of patients who undergo single-port laparoscopic colectomy and conventional laparoscopic colectomy for colonic neoplasia (large polyp not amenable to endoscopic removal/ cancer) through a randomized controlled trial. After informed consent, patients will be randomized to have either conventional or single-port laparoscopic colectomy by a team of surgeons with good experience in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Patients' demographic, operative detail and post-operative outcomes including operating time, blood loss, complications, pain score, analgesic requirement, resumption of gastrointestinal function and length of hospital stay will be recorded prospectively. The patients will be blinded to the type of treatment that they have received during the first three days after operation (post-operative pain and analgesic requirement will be recorded in these period). Patients will have long term up to record for cancer recurrence and survival.  The results of two groups of patients will be compared scientifically to assess if single-incision laparoscopic colectomy results in any difference in outcomes when compared to conventional laparoscopic colectomy.

It is hypothesized that memantine will be safe and well tolerated, and more effective than placebo.
The Role of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus in Predicting Spontaneous Labour at Term The exact mechanism stimulating the parturition in humans is still relatively unknown. Prostaglandins, by mediating cervical ripening and early stimulation of myometrial contractions, are likely to play a major role in the parturition process. Much of the unique fetal circulation is facilitated by the ductus arteriosus. Patency of the ductus arteriosus in utero is primarily maintained via prostaglandins which are highly expressed by smooth muscle cells located in the media of the ductus arteriosus. The aim of the study is to prospectively observe fetal ultrasound changes related to the ductus arteriosus. The primary objective is to prospectively assess, whether any changes in the fetal ductus arteriosus parameters exist at 40 weeks' gestation. The secondary objective is to investigate whether there is an association between the ductus arteriosus parameters and the time to delivery interval at 40 weeks' gestation.

A Study of Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacodynamics of Azacitidine in Children and Young Adults With Acute Myeloid Leukemia. This study is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study that will be run in 2 parts: a safety run-in part to determine the dose of azacitidine and then a second part to determine the efficacy of that dose in children and young adults with acute myeloid leukemia in molecular relapse after their first complete remission.  Indication Treatment of children and young adults with molecular relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after first complete remission (CR1).  Objectives Primary Objectives Safety Run-in Part To establish a safe and tolerable dose of azacitidine to be used in the randomized part of the study.  Randomized Part To evaluate the effect of azacitidine treatment in AML subjects at molecular relapse after CR1 when compared to no treatment with regard to the progression-free rate (PFR) at Day 84 (±4 days) post randomization.  Secondary Objectives Safety Run-in Part To establish azacitidine plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in subjects with molecular relapse AML after CR1 and to assess efficacy.  Randomized Part To evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of azacitidine treatment in subjects with molecular relapse AML after CR1.  Study Design The population of this trial consists of children and young adults with AML who achieved a complete response (CR) with molecular remission, defined as Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) less than 5 x 10-4, following their initial induction therapy and who subsequently have a molecular relapse (defined as increase in MRD level by at least 1 log \[10-fold\] to a level greater than or equal to 5 x 10-4 despite a normal percentage \[\<5%\] of myeloblasts in the bone marrow \[BM\] aspirate and peripheral blood \[PB\], and in the absence of proven histological extramedullary relapse). Eligible subjects have a documented diagnosis of AML with at least one of the following molecular aberrations t(8;21), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, inv(16), CBFb/MYH11, t(9;11), MLL-AF9, NPM1 mutation, or FLT3-ITD mutation. Enrolled/randomized pediatric subjects will be followed with regular MRD testing in order to detect a molecular relapse.  In the safety run-in part, up to 12 subjects aged 3 months to less than 18 years will be enrolled. Six subjects will be enrolled in the first cohort of 100 mg/m2 azacitidine administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle. Six additional subjects could be enrolled into a second cohort of 75 mg/m2 azacitidine administered IV on Days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle depending on the safety and tolerability results of the 100 mg/m2 cohort.  In the randomized part of the study at least 68 subjects will be randomized (or more depending on whether at least 64 subjects are evaluable for the primary endpoint), with at least 60 of the subjects being less than 18 years of age.  Both parts of the study, the safety run-in part and the randomized part, will contain 3 periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the follow-up period. The screening period will last no more than 10 days in the safety run-in part after which the subjects may be enrolled and treated. In the randomized part, the screening period will last an indefinite amount of time until detection of a molecular relapse in the PB followed by confirmation of the relapse in both PB and BM aspirate, at which point the subject may then be randomized. Subjects will be treated with azacitidine (safety run-in part) or in accordance to their assigned treatment arm (randomized part). Upon discontinuation from the treatment period, subjects will enter into the follow-up period which will last up to 2 years from last patient enrolled/randomized.

Combination Therapy of Betaseron-Prograf in Multiple Sclerosis The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a combination of interferon beta 1-b (Betaseron®) and tacrolimus (Prograf®) in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) who have failed treatment with currently approved drugs for MS  Prograf is an immunosuppressant that weakens the immune reactions responsible to protect the organism against infections. It is currently available on the market for patients who have received an organ transplant, to prevent rejection. Because of its effect on the immune system, theoretically, Prograf should exert a significant effect in MS. It has been tried in a small number of MS patients at a lower dose than the one used in organ transplant, however the results of the study did not allow to draw definite conclusions on its safety and efficacy in MS.  Betaseron is approved in Canada for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and for the slowing of progression and reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with secondary-progressive MS. The combination of Betaseron and Prograf may result in an additive effect or an increase in the actions of the drugs. However, the combination of the two drugs has never been studied.  The aim of this study is to see how well the combination of Betaseron and Prograf is tolerated by patients with MS. The side effects of the treatment, if any, will be followed. In addition, the efficacy of the combination will be evaluated.
Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Markers in OSMF Oral Sub mucous Fibrosis (OSMF) is essentially an imbalance between collagen metabolism and wound healing mechanism induced by arecanut chewing habit. Clinically the disease progresses in stages with patients presenting with burning sensation, intolerance to spicy food, vesicles particularly on the palate, ulceration and dryness of the mouth , fibrosis of the oral mucosa, leading to lips, tongue, and palate rigidity and finally trismus. As the disease is progressively debilitating and has potential to turn in to malignant cancer a study was designed to assess if there any tissue or saliva markers that can be assessed for early diagnosis and indicate malignant transformation if any.  Participants who had OSMF and habit history, patients without OSMF but habit history formed the case group where as normal patients without OSMF and no habit history were in control group. Eligible candidates who consented to participate in study were subjected to biopsy procedure and also their saliva samples were collected. Biopsy samples were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess the EMT markers like vimentin, e-cadherin and collagen IV. miRNA copies were extracted from saliva and were subjected RT-PCR.  Research question was:  1. Is EMT a positive signature in OSMF. 2. Does histopathological grading and dysplasia in OSMF have any correlation with EMT. 3. Can aberrant EMT markers be a reliable indicator for risk assessment of early malignant transformation. 4. Can expression of mi RNA 21 in saliva predict the disease severity and more importantly assess risk of early malignant transformation in OSMF.
Exploit the Neural Source and the Feasibility of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy In this project, the investigators will deliver a 5-day session of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the leg motor cortex of the FOG patients to examine whether the intervention will benefit the patients in a double blind randomized design. Six assessments with different combinations of clinical scaling, gait analysis, electrophysiological investigation and fMRI examinations before and after tDCS will be conducted. The treatment and placebo groups will be crossed over after one-month washout. The investigators will investigate whether the possible tDCS beneficial effect will be different or similar in patients with different electric sources. In addition, how long the possible beneficial effect of tDCS can be consolidated after the 5-day course of stimulation is also crucial. The investigators aim to peep the myth of FOG in PD and MSA by the multi-modality approach and hope the study will benefit the long suffering patients.
Bariatric Surgery and Pharmacokinetics of Hydrochlorothiazide Changes to gastric pH, gastric emptying time, gastrointestinal transit-time or the pre-systemic metabolizing effect of enzymes secreted in the mucosa may all alter the pharmacokinetics of medicines. These factors are potentially influenced by bariatric surgery. Little is so far known about how gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy impacts the biological availability of medication. In this study the pharmacokinetic effects of bariatric surgery on hydrochlorothiazide are investigated.
Stricture Definition and Treatment (STRIDENT) Endoscopic Therapy Study Two thirds of patients with Crohn's disease require intestinal surgery at some time in their life. Intestinal strictures, that is narrowing of the bowel due to inflammation and scarring, are the most common reason for surgery.

This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of RP-3500 (camonsertib) alone or in combination with talazoparib or gemcitabine, examine both the pharmacokinetics (PK)and pharmacodynamics (PD)and investigate its anti-tumor activity in solid tumors.
Role of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA)-Gene Interactions in Heath Disparities A randomized, clinical trial to provide the first comprehensive investigation of the role of fatty acid desaturate (FADS) genetic determinants on PUFA biosynthesis and metabolism as well as levels of inflammatory markers in a controlled dietary environment using two (low and high linoleic acid) parallel diets.
Novel Dietary Interventions for Treating Insulin Resistance Clinical and rodent studies have demonstrated the impact of specific dietary factors in modulating inflammation-related diseases including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Such dietary factors include polyunsaturated fats, polyphenols, and glycemic index. The investigators know from previous studies in the literature that reducing the glycemic index and increasing the omega-3 fat and polyphenol content of the diet results in improved metabolic indices and reduced inflammation. These improvements can be observed even within the context of persistent obesity. The investigators will implement a reduced-calorie, multi-pronged dietary approach for improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation in obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome. The active diet will include reduced glycemic index foods together with omega-3 fats and polyphenol supplements. The primary hypothesis is that the dietary combination of reduced glycemic index foods, omega-3 fats and polyphenols will work to reduce insulin resistance and inflammation more efficiently than a placebo-controlled, calorie- and macronutrient-matched diet in obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome.

Assess Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of AntiBKV in Healthy Adult Volunteers. BK virus (BKV) is a member of the polyomavirus family with a prevalence of up to 90% in the general population. In immunocompromized individuals, such as kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who receive immunosuppressant therapy to prevent graft rejection, BKV turns into an opportunistic pathogen. BK viremia has been reported to occur in 10-30% of KTRs. BKV is recognized as a leading cause of impaired graft function and premature transplant loss, and is therefore a serious condition in kidney transplant patients.  At present, there are no effective agents specifically against BKV available and thus no standard treatment that can effectively reduce or prevent BKV infection/reactivation after renal transplantation. Therefore, the proposed indication for the AntiBKV neutralizing antibody is the treatment of BK virus infections and prevention of BK virus associated complications in KTRs.  This study has been designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic of ascending doses of AntiBKV, a fully human highly neutralising antibody against BKV, administered as a single or multiple intravenous infusions to healthy adult participants. The data obtained in this study will provide the basis for further clinical development of AntiBKV.

Damage and Renal Clearance of Glycocalyx in Cardiac Surgery The glycocalyx is a component of the vascular endothelium that currently plays a relevant role in the modified Starling theory.  The manipulation of the heart during cardiac surgery stimulates the release of the natriuretic atrial peptide, which causes endothelial wear in patients undergoing extracorporeal circulation. Dilation of the atrium produces natriuretic atrial peptide, which reduces plasma volume by increasing renal excretion and vascular permeability. The atrial peptide degrades the surface of the coronary endothelium, causing loss of the side cam protein nucleus. This study investigates the relationship between clamping time in cardiac surgery and the clearance of endothelial inflammation markers.
Effects of Copaxone in the Retinal Function in Diabetic Patients After Panphotocoagulation The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Copaxone injections in retinal function and integrity in diabetic patients who underwent pan-retinal photocoagulation.
Assess Use of 18F-Fluciclovine for Patients With Large Brain Metastases Treated With Staged Stereotactic Radiosurgery The spread of cancer to the brain is referred to as brain metastases. Brain metastases are a common complication of cancer. This study is being done to determine whether the use of a new imaging agent, 18F-fluciclovine, is able to detect which patients are responding to radiation therapy. In addition, this study will look at the changes of the treated brain metastases using this imaging agent over time.

Nutrition and Physical Activity Counselling Background: Childhood obesity imposes a great burden on the healthcare system. Given the increased frequency of dental compared to medical visits during childhood, dentists may be in an ideal position to recognize patients at risk of developing obesity. This randomized clinical trial explored the efficacy of a brief nutrition and physical activity counseling for healthy weight 6 to11 year-old children in a university-based pediatric dental clinic.  Methods: 168 children, 6-11 year old, were allocated to test and control groups and their Body Mass index (BMI) were recorded. Their parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire regarding their child's nutrition, physical activity and screen time. The parents/caregivers of the test group then received a brief counseling session that encouraged an increase in children's physical activity, and a decrease in sugar-sweetened beverages and screen time. Data, collected at baseline and follow-up session (within 6-12 months) were analyzed using general linear regression, adjusting for age, gender, socio-demographic characteristics, education, labour force, income and awareness of school nutrition policy (P≤ 0.05).
High-density Activation Mapping of the Slow Pathwayto Guide Catheter Ablation in Patients With Typical Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common supraventricular tachycardia inducible during an electrophysiological study. Although ablative therapy proved to be the treatment of choice, little is known about the components of the tachycardia circuit. The aim of this study is to detect the presence and patterns of specific electrograms representing slow pathway (SP) potentials and to explore Koch's triangle pattern activation during sinus rhythm and/or atrial extraestimulus with a high-density mapping catheter in an attempt to clarify a fast and safety catheter ablation strategy. We hypothesized that, in patients with dual atrioventricular nodal physiology, during sinus rhythm (SR), high-density mapping (HDM) catheters could identify the SP signals, making possible to delineate small areas of slow conduction associated to abnormal electrograms on Koch's triangle. On a second step, radiofrequency (RF) applications safety guided by the HDM obtained with this method, should interrupt the circuit far from the His region. Finally, SP signals should disappear after the RF procedure when performing a new 3D HDM. A control group of patients without AVN dual physiology should show absence of fragmented/slow conduction zones.
Immune Checkpoints in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranked the first in cancer incidence in Hong Kong and it is frequently lethal with heterogeneous drug responses and survival outcomes. Immune-based approaches targeting to enhance tumor-specific responses have been actively under investigation as therapeutic strategies. Currently, PD1 and PD-L1 blockade has shown promising results in clinical trials especially in colorectal cancer patients with microsatellite instability. This study aims to examine the role of PD-L1/PD1 in immune cell-mediated cytotoxicity in colorectal cancer patients.

Effect of Resveratrol and Pharmacist Intervention on Diabetes Mellitus and Its Neuropathic Complication Management of symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy is a difficult issue for clinicians since it usually does not respond to standard analgesics. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring plant-derived, polyphenolic compound, it exerts pleiotropic activity. The investigators believed that the implementation of multidisciplinary approaches including pharmacotherapy and provision of healthcare professional services such as pharmacist intervention are needed for alleviation of diabetic associated neuropathy.Therefore, the hypothesis of the present protocol is that the administration of resveratrol and/or provision of pharmaceutical care in patients with diabetic neuropathy might be of value in improving quality of life and managing diabetic neuropathic pain.The study is designed as a four-arm randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Group one will be given only conventional hypoglycemic drugs. Group two patients will receive conventional hypoglycemic drugs accompanied by pharmacist interventions. Group three; patients will receive resveratrol 500 mg orally once daily after meals for three months, in addition to their regular hypoglycemic drugs. Group four; patients will receive resveratrol 500 mg orally once daily after meals along with their regular hypoglycemic drugs for a period of three months, accompanied by pharmacist interventions. Neuropathic pain will be measured by various neuropathic pain assessment tools. Nerve conduction studies will be performed to assess the effect of interventional therapy. The expected outcome will be the improvement of diabetic neuropathy associated symptoms along with glycemic status.

Inspiratory Muscle Strength Training for Lowering Blood Pressure and Improving Endothelial Function in Postmenopausal Women: Comparison With "Standard of Care" Aerobic Exercise High blood pressure (BP) is the major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related health conditions, particularly among postmenopausal (PM) women. In adults age ≥50 years this risk is primarily driven by above-normal systolic BP (SBP ≥120 mmHg), as diastolic BP plateaus, then decreases in older adulthood. Although SBP is lower in premenopausal women vs. age-matched men, SBP reaches, then surpasses men after age 60. As such, \>75% of PM women in the U.S. have above-normal SBP, which, in turn, is responsible for a 2-fold increase in risk of hypertension and corresponding increases in risk of CVD, chronic kidney disease and many other disorders. A key process linking high SBP to CVD and related conditions is vascular endothelial dysfunction, mediated by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress and reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. As the number of PM women is rapidly growing, further increases in SBP-related CV disorders are projected without effective intervention.  * Aerobic exercise (AE) is a first-line, standard-of-care therapy for lowering BP. In PM women with baseline SBP ≥120 mmHg, AE reduces casual (resting) SBP by \~3 mmHg (back to baseline ≤4 weeks post-training), whereas 24-hour SBP is typically unchanged. However, only 25-30% of PM women meet guidelines for 150 min/week of moderate-intensity AE, citing the extensive time requirement, facility access and travel disruptions as major barriers. Another, far less recognized, limitation is that AE training consistently improves endothelial function in midlife/older men, but not in estrogen-deficient PM (PMe-) women, i.e., in \>95% of the 60+million PM women in the U.S. Thus, establishing new lifestyle therapies that induce and sustain reductions in SBP and increases in endothelial function in PMe- women with above-normal SBP is an important public health goal. * High-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a time-efficient (5 minutes per session) lifestyle intervention consisting of 30 inspiratory maneuvers performed against a high resistance. Preliminary data suggest 6-weeks of IMST performed 6 days/week reduces SBP by 9 mmHg in adults with above-normal SBP (i.e., greater than 120 mmHg) at baseline. Importantly, this reduction in SBP is equal to or greater than the reduction in blood pressure typically achieved with time- and effort-intensive healthy lifestyle strategies like conventional aerobic exercise. In addition, IMST improved endothelial function in the PMe- women in a small pilot study. * To translate these promising preliminary results towards clinical practice, this randomized clinical trial is being conducted to directly compare the efficacy of a longer, clinically relevant treatment duration of IMST (3 months) against home-based, moderate-intensity (standard-of-care) AE in PMe-women. The primary outcome will be the change in casual SBP (IMST vs. AE). Changes in 24-hour SBP and endothelial function will serve as secondary outcomes. Effects on NO bioavailability, ROS/oxidative stress, and the role of "circulating factors" will provide insight into mechanisms of action. The sustained effects on SBP and endothelial function also will be assessed. * Accordingly, a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, parallel group design clinical trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of 3-months of IMST (75 percent maximal inspiratory pressure) vs. brisk walking (40-60% heart rate reserve; an established healthy lifestyle strategy) for lowering SBP and improving endothelial function in PMe- women age 50 years and older with above-normal SBP. It is hypothesized that IMST will lower SBP and improve endothelial function by decreasing oxidative stress and increasing nitric oxide bioavailability. It is also expect that adherence to the intervention will be excellent (over 80 percent of all training sessions completed at the appropriate intensity). * To test this hypothesis, 90 PMe- women age 50 years and older who have SBP \>/= 120 mmHg will be recruited. Participants will undergo baseline testing for casual (resting) SBP, 24-hour ambulatory SBP and endothelial function. Innovative mechanistic probes including pharmaco-dissection with vitamin C, analysis of biopsied endothelial cells, and high-throughput metabolomics, will be performed to assess oxidative stress and nitric oxide bioavailability at baseline. * After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to perform either 3-months of high-resistance IMST or brisk walking. Subjects will train 6 days/week. Following 3 months of training, subjects will redo all the tests that were done during baseline testing to assess training-induced changes in SBP, physiological functions, and underlying mechanisms. Subjects will then cease training for 6 weeks before returning to the lab for follow-up testing to determine the persistent effects of IMST.
Evaluating the Efficacy of a Brief Online Intervention Among Current Heavy Drinkers Unhealthy alcohol consumption is common in the UK and causes tremendous harm to the individual, as well as harm to others. A significant gap in providing alcohol support is that most people with unhealthy alcohol consumption will never receive advice to cut down on their drinking. However, many are interested in self-directed interventions to help them evaluate their drinking and to motivate reductions in alcohol use. One such promising intervention uses online personalised normative feedback (PNF) which compares a person's drinking with others in the general population of the same age and sex. PNF interventions are thought to work because many people with unhealthy alcohol consumption overestimate how much others drink. Multiple trials have demonstrated that providing PNF to people with unhealthy consumption reduces their alcohol use . While several UK websites do provide feedback on assessment of risk (e.g., Down Your Drink introductory section, Alcohol Change UK), there appears to be no online intervention that provides PNF for unhealthy alcohol consumption.  The major objective of this pilot project is to conduct a two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which 1,318 participants recruited from the Prolific website who have identified themselves as drinking 14 or more units per week are randomly assigned to one of two groups - a) those who are offered a PNF report, and b) those in a no intervention comparator group. Participants in the comparator group will not be provided any intervention materials but will instead be given a list of the different components of the PNF feedback and will be asked to think about how useful they would find each of them. Follow-up assessment will occur at 1 and 6 months post-randomisation. The project is described as a pilot because it is a preliminary evaluation of the PNF intervention in a UK context.

Acceptable Range of Inspiratory Effort During Mechanical Ventilation Partially assisted mechanical ventilation is ideally titrated to maintain adequate inspiratory muscle activity (i.e. preventing disuse atrophy) while avoiding excessive (i.e. fatiguing) inspiratory loads. The advent of ventilator modes enabling flow and pressure assistance in proportion to patient inspiratory effort (i.e. Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV), Neurally-Adjusted Ventilator Assist (NAVA)) permit careful titration of ventilatory support to achieve desired levels of patient inspiratory effort. However, data on the acceptable range of values for inspiratory effort and respiratory muscle load-capacity balance during mechanical ventilation are currently very limited. Such data are critical to inform a physiologically sound evidence-based approach to titrating partially-assisted ventilatory support. This study is designed to ascertain a physiologically acceptable range of inspiratory effort in mechanically ventilated patients. The study protocol includes measurements of the respiratory system during spontaneous breathing as well as evaluating the diaphragm in real-time with the use of ultrasonography. The experimental design outlined in the present study is predicated on the assumption that the range of values for inspiratory effort and load-capacity balance observed in patients who are successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation represent the safe and appropriate range of target values.
Provider Burnout During COVID-19 Since the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was first reported in the Hubei province of China in December 2019, the US has become an epicenter for the pandemic, accounting for more than 220,000 cases and 4,800 deaths (CDC). The rapid spread of the associated disease, COVID-19, has overwhelmed healthcare systems in spite of unprecedented measures to reduce contagion. The resulting uncertainty with regard to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and limited availability of resources and treatment have been detrimental to the mental health of frontline healthcare providers (NIH). Preserving the psychological wellbeing of these individuals is paramount to mitigating the effect of COVID-19 and delivering optimal patient care.  Of particularly grave concern is how professional and personal distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will affect provider burnout (Lai et al. JAMA Network Open 2020). Professional burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, career de-prioritization, and loss of self-efficacy, represents a significant threat to the US healthcare system (Shanafelt et al. Ann Surg 2010; Han et al. Annals of Internal Medicine 2019). While burnout has been described as a reaction to chronic work-related stress (Melamed et al. Psychol. Bull. 2006), individual factors such as anxiety increase susceptibility to burnout (Sun et al. J Occup Health 2012). Although data suggests that occupational stress might amplify risk of anxiety (DiGiacomo and Adamson J Allied Health 2001), we have yet to understand how intensified anxiety among frontline providers during global health crises contributes to burnout. Similarly, it is unknown whether factors such as perceived organizational support (POS), a key driver of job satisfaction and performance (Muse and Stamper, J Managerial Issues 2007), modify anxiety and burnout under these circumstances. We hypothesize that diminished POS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with burnout and that this relationship is mediated by an increase in providers' anxiety. Delineating this relationship is a critical first step in developing interventions that ease the mental health burden of this pandemic and future crises for healthcare providers.
Combined Exercise and Nutrition Intervention for Spinal Sarcopenia Sarcopenia in the lumbar paraspinal muscles is receiving renewed attention as a cause of spinal degeneration. However, there were few studies on the precise concept and diagnostic criteria for spinal sarcopenia. We have already developed the concept of spinal sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults and investigated the association between conventional sarcopenic indices and spinal sarcopenia. However, intervention studies on spinal sarcopenia have not been conducted until now. Here, we aim a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined exercise and nutrition intervention for spinal sarcopenia.  This is a prospective study with 35 community-dwelling older women who were diagnosed as spinal sarcopenia in our previous cohort study. Combined intervention will consist of back extensor strengthening exercise and nutritional supplementation for 12 weeks. The primary outcome of this study is isometric back extensor strength after 12 weeks' intervention. All functional outcomes will be measured at 0, 12, and 24 weeks after intervention. The data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.

Evaluation of the Association of Polymorphisms in the Innate Immune System With the Risk for Cryptococcus Neoformans Infection in Patients Not Infected With HIV and Complications Associated With Cryptococcus Neoformans Infection Innate immunity plays an important role for fungal recognition and initiation of fungicidal activity. We hypothesize that subtle differences in different molecules of innate immunity may contribute to either the predisposition or clinical course of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans. To test this hypothesis, we propose to analyze the allelic frequencies of 15 different genes (mannose binding lectin, Fc-gamma receptor IIa and IIb, Fc-gamma receptors IIIa and IIIb, myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and -beta, interleukin 1A and 1B, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-10, NRAMP-1, chitotriosidase, and chemokine receptor 5) and their intragenic polymorphic forms and to compare this data to the incidence and severity of C neoformans infection. With this study we hope to identify a group of molecules of innate immunity which influence the risk and severity of invasive C neoformans infection.
Effect of Intravenous Fluid Therapy on Postoperative Vomiting in Children Undergoing Otorhinolaryngological Surgery The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the interaction of intravenous fluid therapy during otorhinolaryngological surgery, on postoperative vomiting.

Miradry Treatment for Focal Axillary Hyperhidrosis Primary hyperhidrosis is a pathological condition characterized by the idiopathic and excessive secretion of sweat beyond normal physiological demand and is localized at particular foci such as the face, axilla, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Patients seeking medical attention for hyperhidrosis often report disruptions to their professional and/or social lives due to sweating and subsequently experience many psychosocial difficulties, such as anxiety, social phobia, and depression. Therefore, a psychiatric explanation of causality is frequently offered for these patients during diagnosis. Excessive sweating is often mistakenly interpreted as a symptom of an anxiety disorder and can be cause for social embarrassment, exacerbating emotional stress and social avoidance. As currently constituted, the treatment of secondary psychosocial symptoms in primary hyperhidrosis is poorly understood and requires further investigation.

Room Air a Safe Alternative to Dye Injection in Ureterography The procedure began in the Thirties .Retrograde pyelography is an essential step in most endoscopic procedure. This procedure is used as an investigation, with different indication in the past and the present, to delineate the ureter and pelvicalyceal system either before or after the operation, for example to detect any complication as a perforation and the need for stent placement. The procedure has an alternative, less invasive, the IVP. Multiple articles explored the use of air in the puncture of PCNL and to identify the posterior calyx, but to our knowledge there is no articles addressed the idea of air injection in the ureter. The greatest fear is air embolism or non-visualization of the ureter. The availability and cost of contrast material may be a problem, most urologist face

An Investigation of the Association Between Helicobacter Pylori Infection and Abdominal Pain in Cystic Fibrosis Patients Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians. While the pulmonary disease in CF receives most of the attention, gastrointestinal diseases occur in \>95% of CF individuals and can contribute to significant morbidity, mortality and a decreased quality of life. The abdominal pain in CF is usual chronic in nature, and the etiology is not usually found, despite medical testing for standard causes of abdominal pain. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is increasingly being recognized as the etiology of peptic ulcer disease and other upper and lower gastrointestinal tract diseases.1 The role that Hp plays in CF abdominal pain has not been elucidated.  Our long-term goal is to understand relationship between chronic HP infection and abdominal pain in pediatric CF patients.  The specific objective of this proposal is to utilize current state-of-the-art testing for HP to determine the prevalence of Hp in our CF patients age 5 and older.  The central hypothesis is that Cystic fibrosis subjects with significant abdominal pain will have an increased incidence of Helicobacter pylori as determined by the urea breath test and stool antigen test.  The rationale for the proposed research is that once we elucidate a causal relationship between CF patients with abdominal pain and Hp, we can begin treatment of this infection to improve quality of life.

HR-HPV integration status will be analyzed by Molecular Combing technology, which allows direct and high-resolution visualization of the integration of high-risk HPV genomes.
European SIR-Spheres Surgical Registry Liver resection is the only curative treatment option for primary and secondary liver tumors. For some primary or secondary malignancies (HCC, NET) liver transplantation is a possible treatment option. Unfortunately, the majority of patients show a high hepatic tumor load or adverse intrahepatic distribution, that resection or transplantation at the time of initial diagnosis is not possible. In that case different treatment approaches are possible. For those patients that are very unlikely to ever become resectable, palliative systemic therapy is the preferred treatment option. For those patients that may become resectable after downsizing of the tumors or increase of volume of the future liver remnant secondary resection after induction therapy may be a possibility. Then, an induction treatment that has the most likelihood of causing physical shrinkage of the tumors is usually preferred. One of the approaches to create contralateral hypertrophy to increase future liver remnant is portal vein embolization. However, tumor growth might be stimulated during the phase of hypertrophy. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres is an endovascular interventional radio-oncologic procedure treating primary and secondary liver tumors1-3. It offers radiation therapy with yttrium-90, a high-energy beta-emitting isotope, directly in the vascular system of liver tumors. It treats the tumor locally, saves healthy liver tissue and could lead to hypertrophy of this residual healthy liver tissue due to the embolization effect. Therefore secondary liver resection after SIRT might become possible4,5. SIRT could also be an option as bridging-, downsizing- or downstaging-therapy before liver transplantation.  Liver resection with local tumor treatment and hypertrophy induction after SIRT seems to be a promising therapy option. Previous reports have shown the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this therapeutic strategy.  Aim of the European SIR-Spheres Surgical Registry - ESSURE - is now to further improve the understanding and optimize the process and patient selection of this therapy strategy in its true clinical setting. This registry enables data collection on the real-life clinical application of liver resection/liver transplantation after SIRT.
Efficacy and Safety of Umbilical Cord Blood Injection for Critical Limb Ischemia The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with umbilical cord blood stem cells will improve blood flow to the most severely affected leg of a participant with medically refractory and non-surgical peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity.
Trial Comparing Kaffes Stent With Plastic Prosthesis in the Treatment of Anastomotic Biliary Strictures Post Orthotopic Liver Transplantation Biliary anastomotic strictures (post liver transplantation) occur in 15-20 % of the cases. Biliary stenting using plastic prosthesis during a period of 1 year is the treatment of choice. Problematic in this approach is the regular change, necessary to overcome occlusion of the stent, resulting in cholestasis and/or infection. This change needs to be performed every 3 months or more frequently in patients with symptoms of stent occlusion.  The Kaffes stent (RMS) is a metallic removable stent, especially constructed for the treatment of biliary anastomotic strictures post liver transplantation. The advantage could be that this stent is less prone to occlusion with a lower change frequency (e.g. every 6 months).  No randomized, controlled trial (RCT) or data exist comparing plastic stenting versus Kaffes stenting.

Effectiveness of a Network of Trained Volunteers Automatically Activated, on the Reduction of the Start Time of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Maneuvers. Study Protocol. Background Cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) is a health emergency with high mortality. Mortality could depends on the start time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuvers (and the quality of its performance) and the use of the automated external defibrillator (AED).  Methods / design The aim of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a network of volunteers automatically activated by smartwatch and smartphone, on the reduction of the start time of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers. It is developed in four phases: 1) validation of an application (App) for smartwatch developed to automatically generate a health alert in case of out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest (OHCA); 2) training course in basic CPR maneuvers and use of the AED aimed at the civilian population; 3) creation of a network of volunteers trained in CPR and using the AED that covers the city; 4) simulation study in which members of the network of volunteers will be activated automatically through their smartphone to attend simulated OHCA. 134 activations of the alert will be made. On 67 occasions the alert will be directed to the emergency health services and to the network of volunteers (intervention group). On 67 occasions the alert will be directed to the emergency health services (control group). The arrival time of the first rescuer, category of the first rescuer (emergency services or network of volunteers), start time of the maneuvers and competence in the performance of the maneuvers will be recorded.  Discussion Training in CPR maneuvers is recommended for the civilian population and especially for relatives and close persons of people with heart disease to reduce the start time of CPR and improve survival rates due to CRA. This study aims to observe that the start time of CPR maneuvers and use of the AED will be lower in the intervention group than in the control group.

Effects of Recto-colic Enemas of Butyrate on the Digestive Disorders of Very Low Birth Weight Preterms <1250 Grams Clinical management of very low birth weight newborns (VLBW \<1250g) consists in several challenges to adapt immature physiological systems to extrauterine life. Advances in neonatal medicine for pulmonary and/or neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases have significantly improved outcomes of these children. However, the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract remains a major cause of morbidity due to  1. the immaturity of GI functions (prolonged ileus, bacterial overgrowth and translocation), 2. the complication of GI tract immaturity: intestinal perforation and enterocolitis necrotizing) 3. the need of a prolonged parenteral nutrition and its complications (central venous catheter infections, sepsis, electrolyte disturbances) but without generate a high proof level on this targeted population (\<1250g).  The GI functions are progressively acquired during development and are largely sensitive to the environment, especially the intestinal luminal content. Indeed, probiotics and prebiotics have shown beneficial effects upon GI functions of newborns. One of the metabolite of the gut flora potentially involved is the butyrate. Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid produced in the colon by the microbiota (carbo-hydrates degradation). The colonic amount of butyrate increases gradually after birth. The beneficial effects of butyrate are related to its properties upon the epithelial barrier (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, barrier repair) and upon the enteric nervous system (network of neurons and glial cells) that regulate GI functions and in particular colonic motility.  To date, there is no clinical consensus to manage digestive disorders of VLBW. Several clinical studies have assessed the effects of prokinetic drugs, dietary supplements (probiotics, prebiotics) but without generate a high proof level on this targeted population. In this context, a recent study of our Research Unit (INSERM-CIC Mère-Enfant 004) has shown benefit effects of oral probiotics supplementation in children with birth weight greater than 1000g but not in extreme preterms with birth weight less than 1000g.  The main hypothesis to explain theses results lies in the intensive use of antibiotic and feeding interruption frequency in this targeted population which induce disturbances in the composition of the gut lumen (in particular the flora).  Colonic enemas assessed in various observational studies concerning VLBW seem to demonstrate a clinical efficiency upon the colonic transit, underlying by mechanical and osmotic mechanisms.  Here, the investigators propose to evaluate the clinical efficiency of butyrate enemas by a prospective randomized clinical trial blinded design.  The purpose of NEOTRANS study is to demonstrate that butyrate enemas may improve the nutritional management of extreme preterm less than 1250 grams, by facilitating the development of colic motility and clinical nutrition tolerance.
Daily Vinegar Ingestion and Metabolic Health The purpose of this study is to determine if vinegar ingestion promotes beneficial changes to metabolic health parameters in healthy, overweight adults.
Three Techniques for Ultrasound Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Block The brachial plexus block is an anesthetic technique often used for surgical procedures of the upper limb. The brachial plexus block through the axilla (BPVA) is one of the techniques most commonly used to obtain regional anesthesia of the upper limbs, being performed by anesthesia of the terminal branches of the brachial plexus, which would be the ulnar, median, radial and musculocutaneous nerves. With the aid of ultrasound , two techniques can be used to perform the BPVA . The first , known as multiple puncture technique , the local anesthetic is deposited around each nerve that want to block . This technique is most commonly used to perform the BPVA . The second technique , known as 2 injections , local anesthetic is deposited below the axillary artery and around the musculocutaneous nerve . This technique has been proposed to try to reduce the execution time of anesthesia . Studies actually show that the technique of 2 injections showed less time to perform the block, with the same success rate. However, the technique of 2 injections showed a longer latency and higher rate of vascular puncture . (14) In order to perform a procedure with shorter execution time , without changing the latency, success rate and ensuring patient safety , the investigators designed this protocol to evaluate three techniques for performing the ultrasound- guided axillary brachial plexus block.

The Effect of Per Oral Immunotherapy in Severe IgE Mediated Egg, Milk, and Nut Allergy in Adults In Finland, the estimated prevalence of physician-diagnosed food allergy in 1-4 year old children is 9%, and the most common allergen is milk. The overall food allergy has been reported to be 3.7%. Hen's egg allergy is among the most common food allergies in childhood. In addition, it predicts later development of allergic disease such as asthma. Most of the egg and milk allergy is transient and disappears in childhood. Currently, the standard of care for food allergy includes strict allergen avoidance. However, oral immunotherapy has been under investigation in children milk, egg, and wheat allergy. Previously, induction of clinical egg tolerance has been reported with egg oral immunotherapy in children aged from 3 to 13 years. In adults, strict avoidance is still the standard care but there is also growing interest in treatment of severe food allergy with oral immunotherapy or anti-IgE.  The investigators aim to analyse the results of per oral immunotherapy treatment in severe IgE-mediated egg, milk, and nut allergy in adults.  Could severe egg, milk and nut allergy be treated with oral immunotherapy treatment in stead of total allergen avoidance and could desensitization thus be achieved?

Measurement of Forces Applied Using a Macintosh Direct Laryngoscope Compared to GlideScope Video Laryngoscope During Anesthesia many patients require that a breathing be inserted into their windpipe. This is usually achieved using a direct laryngoscope, consisting of a retraction blade with a light near its end. When achieving a direct line-of-sight to the windpipe is difficult, more force is often applied, resulting in greater patient stress. A GlideScope video laryngoscope uses a camera and light source to see the windpipe. This enables the user to see objects that may not be in the direct line-of-sight. This likely results in less force being required, reducing patient stress. Because such stresses are often confounded by patient variables, we are comparing the forces required by the direct and video laryngoscopes on patients with at least one risk factor for difficulty, by directly measuring these with special sensors attached to the laryngoscope blades.

A Clinical Trial of YH14642 in Patients With Chronic Periodontal Disease This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of YH14642 in Korea patients with chronic periodontitis, in order to investigate the recommended therapeutic dose.
Cisplatin and Radiation Therapy With or Without Tirapazamine in Treating Patients With Cervical Cancer This randomized phase III trial is studying cisplatin, radiation therapy, and tirapazamine to see how well they work compared to cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and tirapazamine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Cisplatin and tirapazamine may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin together with radiation therapy is more effective with or without tirapazamine in treating cervical cancer.

Effects of Different Cardiorespiratory Training Program on Endurance Performance Conventional training methods are typically administered in a fixed progressive manner, which can lead to sub-optimal responses and injuries. Artificial intelligence (i.e. CURATE.AI) can be harnessed to personalise physical training strategies. Using a single participant training profile, a parabolic/quadratic response to the intervention can be generated to identify the training intensity needed to optimise training outcomes. Previous studies showed CURATE.AI could dynamically modulate drug dosing in oncology. Extending the utility of results to human performance, this study will adapt CURATE.AI with the goal of optimising endurance performance through individualised training regimes.  Up to 20 participants will be recruited and randomised into two groups to undergo a calibration phase, which involves performing 3 sessions of exercise sessions per week over 2 weeks per intensity (low, moderate and high) in a crossover study design. Exercise sessions will be interspersed with a 2.4 km time trial, a VO2peak test and 2 weeks of wash out period. The utility phase will divide participants into two groups to undergo 3 exercise sessions per week, totalling to 12 exercise sessions. Either an AI-led training or a conventional training programme will be performed to compare the differences in training outcomes. Blood plasma will be obtained at selected time points in both phases to evaluate the effects of training on blood lipid profiles.  Findings from this study can potentially optimise efficacy and efficiency of endurance performance through personalised training with AI.
Interviews and Video Capture in Patients With GM1 Gangliosidosis GM1 gangliosidosis is a rare disease for which there is a limited understanding of disease progression and meaningful outcome measures. In addition, parents report that clinic-based assessments are not always well-suited to capture all the disease features and other metrics that have an impact on the patient and family. To address the methodological challenges of this small, heterogeneous population, this study will collect patient-specific home-based video data and qualitative interviews with caregivers.
Crossover Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability of a Novel Furosemide Regimen Administered Subcutaneously vs. the Same Dose Administered Intravenously in Subjects With Chronic Heart Failure The proposed study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of intravenous and subcutaneous Furosemide.

The test formulation in this study is a buffered solution, Furosemide Injection Solution at 30 mg/mL at pH 7.4 (range 7.0 to 7.8) and is intended for SC injection according to the instructions in the protocol. A commercial formulation of Furosemide Injection, USP will serve as the reference drug in this study, which will be administered by IV bolus. It contains furosemide 10 mg/mL in solution at alkaline pH of 8.0 to 9.3 and is marketed for IV and IM injection.  The primary objective of the study is to estimate the absolute bioavailability of furosemide administered by subcutaneous infusion compared with an equivalent dose of furosemide administered by IV bolus administration.
Preoperative Oral Carbohydrate Treatment Minimizes Insulin Resistance Insulin resistance is a positive protective reaction against surgery .this resistance has some negative consequences for patient health. It is associated with infectious complications. At the same time, Postoperative insulin resistance has been shown to correlate with the length of postoperative stay in hospital. Recently several clinical studies have shown that a carbohydrate-rich drink given 2 h before surgery diminishes postoperative insulin resistance in patient. The aim of our study is to investigate the influence on insulin resistance in patient with diabetes.

Relationships in Good Hands - Clinical and Cost-effectiveness of Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy The research question is: Can the research recommend better ways for social care and health services to work work together to help adoptive and foster families? Can a therapy called DDP improve the mental health of 5-12 year old fostered or adopted children? Is DDP worth the commitment families need to give to it - and the extra cost to the services that deliver it? More than half of adopted or fostered children in the UK have mental health problems including ADHD (i.e. hyperactivity, impulsive behaviour and poor concentration), antisocial behaviour and problems with relationships. Abused and neglected children are more likely than others to have problems in school, become homeless, get involved in crime and even die young (e.g. from suicide), yet there are no fully tested treatments for such complex mental health problems. This is a huge problem because early treatment could greatly improve children's life chances - and reduce strain on health and social care budgets.  There is a Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP) a parent-child therapy that takes around 20 sessions and focusses on "Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity and Empathy". There is not yet available really good evidence for or against it: many UK therapists like DDP, but it is a big commitment for families: once a week for about six months children will need time off school, the parents will need time off work - and this can be hard to explain to school friends, colleagues and bosses. Research team doesn't just need to know if DDP improves children's mental health - they also need to know if the commitment needed is worth it for families and whether the costs to services outweigh the benefits.  In PHASE 1 the research team will find out whether DDP can work smoothly in the three different settings where it is usually delivered: the NHS, Social Care and Private Practice. Many abused children need other medical and psychiatric support so, the research will assess whether children can get any additional assessments or referrals they may need .  In PHASE 2, the research team plans to find out if it is practically possible to run a high quality trial of DDP. This phase will involve 60 families to find out if they are happy to take part (whether offered DDP or usual services). If all goes to plan, these 60 families will contribute to the final results, along with the 180 families involved in the next PHASE 3 when the research team will test whether DDP is better than usual services and, if it is, whether the improvements in child mental health outweigh the costs.  What impact will the research have? This study will make recommendations about how services should work together to help abused and neglected children and their families. If the researcher team finds that DDP is worth the time and money, it could improve the mental health of abused and neglected children across the world.
Cardiac Mitochondrial Function After Heart Transplantation Studies have shown that cardiac function is affected immediately after heart transplantation (HTx), but seems to recover to some extent over the first year. This immediate effect is associated with lack of oxygen in the tissue and reperfusion injury causing cellular energy depletion, mitochondrial failure and cellular damage. This condition may progress into full blown primary graft failure (PGF), characterized as deterioration of the transplanted heart, which is seen in 3-30 % of HTx patients. In addition to PGF, chronic rejection owing to cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) may develop.  PGF and CAV remain the major heart related mortality causes, and additional assessment and treatments are therefore needed.  Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is diagnosed based on endomyocardial biopsies (EMB), which are routinely performed to ensure prober immunosuppression in HTx patients. ACR occur in approximately 25% of HTx patients, and is associated with PGF and CAV. However, mitochondrial function and integrity may prove to be a more sensitive marker of allograft rejection than endomyocardial biopsies. Therefore, assessment of mitochondrial function may allow for earlier detection of allograft rejection and dysfunction. This may be of particular importance as emerging treatments are targeting both energy substrate supply for adenosine-triphosphate generation produced by the mitochondria and mitochondrial function in the failing heart.  Despite the association between graft rejection and mitochondrial function, it remains unsettled whether mitochondrial function associate with PGF, ACR and CAV. Such findings may be of prognostic importance and even elucidate new treatment targets. Hence, we evaluate the mitochondrial status in HTx patients through four studies designed to assess different aspects of the interplay between cardiac function and mitochondrial integrity and function.  Hypotheses:  Study 1: Primary graft pump function is correlated to mitochondrial function in the first myocardial biopsy taken from the donor heart during the operation.  Study 2: Cardiac mitochondrial function improves over the first 3 months after a heart transplantation.  Study 3: Heart transplant patients with moderate to severe coronary graft vasculopathy has impaired mitochondrial function.  Study 4: Myocardial external energy efficiency by positron-emission tomography can be used as a marker of mitochondrial function and chronic rejection in HTx patients.
Tolerance and Efficacy of Rituximab in Sjogren's Disease CLINICAL PHASE II INDICATION Sjogren's syndrome RATIONALE Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder affecting 0.2% to 3% of the general population. Pharmacological treatment can improve the sicca symptoms, often transiently, but they are unable to modify the course of the disease.Open label studies suggested that low-dose rituximab produced acute and complete CD20 depletion in blood and tissue; was well tolerated without corticosteroid use; and significantly improved glandular and extra-glandular manifestations of pSS. Larger controlled studies are now warranted. Our hypothesis is that two infusions of 1000 mg of Rituximab may be better than placebo to treat patients suffering from pSS. To test this hypothesis, we propose to compare patients with recent and/or severe pSS treated with either Rituximab or placebo.  OBJECTIVES Primary objective : Evaluation of the efficacy defined as a 30% improvement between Day 1 and Week 24 in the values on 2 of the 4 VAS measuring global scores of the disease (activity of the disease including extra glandular manifestations), joint pain, fatigue, and the most disturbing dryness.Secondary objectives : Variations from baseline to week 24 of:  The 0-100-mm VAS scores for dry mouth, dry eyes, dry trachea, dry vagina, and dry skin; fatigue; pain; Tender and swollen joint counts; Tender points; Other systemic manifestation; Unstimulated salivary flow rate; Schirmer and van Bijsterveld scores (2-3); C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); rheumatoid factor (RF); ANA; serum IgG, IgA, and IgM; complement; cryoglobulinemia; and counts of B and T cells; Evaluation of the safety of Rituximab during the study Evaluation of the improvement evaluated on VAS by the physician Evaluation of the disease activity scores as suggested by Bowman and Vitali Evaluation of Chisholm score, B cells characteristics and DNA microarray on labial accessory salivary gland (SG) biopsy samples, and salivary gland echography at inclusion and at week 24.  TRIAL DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : 120

Diaphragmatic Pacemaker in Tetraplegic Patients With Spinal Cord Injuries Permanent dependency of breathing apparatus due to spinal cord injury is traditionally treated with different types of mechanical ventilation. However, the electric ventilation became a possibility through their most current versions, such as diaphragmatic pacemakers.  Diaphragmatic pacemakers rhythmically stimulates the diaphragm to replace the functions of the respiratory center that doesn't works well or is inaccessible. However, this modality has the prerequisite that the phrenic nerve and diaphragm muscle are normal. The reason for the development of diaphragmatic pacemaker freeing the patient from the ventilator.  By using the mechanical energy of the diaphragm of the patient, the patient may come not need the ventilator tubing, tracheostomy, and with the help of their caregivers, the inconvenient mechanical ventilators.

Online Counseling to Enable Lifestyle-focused Obesity Treatment in Primary Care With over half of the US population currently overweight and 31% of adults now obese, the primary care setting may represent an important source of weight-loss support, in the interest of cardiovascular prevention. Yet, although the US Preventive Services task force recommends that physicians screen all adult patients for obesity and offer intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese adults, the recommendation has not been widely implemented. The Internet may help overcome many of the barriers that have prevented intensive obesity counseling in the clinical setting. The aim of this study is to examine whether Internet-based interventions for developing healthier lifestyles can improve preventive health care in a cost-effective manner.

KONCERT A Kaletra ONCE Daily Randomised Trial of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Efficacy of Twice-daily Versus Once-daily Lopinavir/Ritonavir Tablets Dosed by Weight as Part of Combination Antiretroviral Therapy in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Infected Children (PENTA 18) The trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy and acceptability of twice- and once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (Kaletra) dosed by weight in HIV-1 infected children who are currently taking lopinavir/ritonavir as part of their combination antiretroviral therapy and who are currently achieving virological suppression (\<50 copies/ml). Specifically:  * To confirm weight-based dosing recommendations by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir half strength formulation tablets dosed on body weight and comparing to historical adult and paediatric data of pharmacokinetics of lopinavir/ritonavir soft gel capsules and oral solution respectively (1, 2). * To compare the pharmacokinetics of twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir tablets with once-daily dosing in the same children. * To evaluate whether once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir is comparable to twice-daily dosing in terms of virological suppression at 48 weeks. Adherence and acceptability will also be compared.
NeuroQore rTMS (Monophasic vs. Biphasic) for Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of individuals in North America and can result in clinical symptoms including loss of pleasure and feelings of worthlessness, in addition to significant cognitive impairments (e.g., memory, attention) that affect daily functioning. Major depression bears a heavy burden for the individuals and family members afflicted, as well as an enormous health care and economic cost. Approximately half of major depressive patients seek out treatment for their illness and only 20% of those individuals report their treatment as satisfactory. Many MDD patients do not respond to pharmacological therapy following the first course of treatment, resulting in the need for alternative measures to alleviate the clinical and cognitive symptoms of treatment-resistant depression and the targeting of these therapies to better suit each individual patient. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-accepted, non-invasive technique that utilizes currents to induce electrical fields that excite specific brain regions. The current recommended practice of rTMS involves the administration of a biphasic stimulus waveform; however, a novel method using monophasic pulses may prove more effective for the treatment of depression. The present study aims to determine the effect of monophasic rTMS compared to biphasic rTMS on cognitive processing in MDD patients through electrophysiological recordings of the brain taken before and after 6 weeks of stimulation. Additionally, the study aims to investigate various biological markers linked to clinical rTMS response; these brain markers will help in personalizing treatment for individuals suffering from MDD.

During treatment, the patient's coagulopathy status will also be evaluated.
Hemodialysis Vitamin D Pilot Vitamin D is a prohormone obtained through diet, supplementation, or sun exposure. Once absorbed, this nutritional vitamin D undergoes a two-step reaction in the liver and in the kidney to become the active hormone, calcitriol. Besides the kidney, many other body tissues are capable of local vitamin D activation. This local tissue activity is important for maintenance of health and relies on adequate levels of nutritional vitamin D. Not only are dialysis patients deficient in calcitriol due to kidney failure, but they are also deficiency in nutritional vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with higher rates of death, heart and blood vessel disease, osteoporosis, falls, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Despite this, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of nutritional vitamin D in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The investigators hypothesize that long-term supplementation with nutritional vitamin D in HD patients improves survival and cardiovascular outcomes. Before embarking on a large scale RCT, the investigators propose a small pilot RCT with 20 hemodialysis patients to: i) To determine the effects of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in raising blood vitamin D levels; ii) To determine the feasibility and barriers to successful randomization and adherence to treatment protocols, which will inform subsequent studies.

Memantine and Constraint-Induced Language Therapy in Chronic Poststroke Aphasia:A Randomized Controlled Trial * Aphasia, the loss or impairment of language caused by brain damage, is one of the most devastating cognitive impairments of stroke. Aphasia can be treated with combination of speech-language therapy and drugs. Conventional speech-language therapy in chronic aphasic subjects is of little help and several drugs have been studied with limited success. Therefore other therapeutic strategies are warranted. * Recent data suggest that drugs (memantine) acting on the brain chemical glutamate may help the recovery of cognitive deficits, included language, in subjects with vascular dementia. The present study examines the safety profile and efficacy of memantine paired with intensive language therapy in subjects with stroke-related chronic aphasia (more than 1 yr. of evolution).

Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy Study of PP1420 in HV Obesity is a growing pandemic which affects 1 in 4 adults in the UK, and shortens life by increasing cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Current treatments for obesity have either poor efficacy or significant side effects. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is a promising new drug target as it produces powerful appetite suppression which, following a 90-minute infusion continues to act for 24 h in man. We have developed a new long lasting high potency analogue of PP, PP1420. This is delivered as a once-a-day subcutaneous injection via a painless fine-gauge needle.  In a first-time-in-man Phase 1a trial, that PP 1420 proved safe, well tolerated, and had extended pharmacokinetics compared to PP itself.  We now plan to study the safety and PK of PP1420 up to 64mg. We will also assess:  1. Its efficacy in reducing food intake after a single dose in a Phase 1B study in healthy volunteers. 2. Its efficacy in reducing food intake and weight after multiple dosing in a Phase 1C study in healthy volunteers.
Assessment of Sleep Complaints in Brain Tumor Survivors Survivors of pediatric brain tumors are noted to have increased rates of excessive daytime sleepiness.

Pain Neuroscience Education in Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is highly prevalent, disabling and with high socio-economic costs, with many negative effects on quality of life. CMP affects the ability to perform work, social, recreational and domestic tasks by changing the mood and concentration of this population that suffers.  In a study carried out in 2010, 17% of the Spanish population had experienced pain in the last month and according to the severity of symptoms 12% felt severe , 64% moderate and 24% mild pain. In this same study it is specified that 61% was due to back pain, 29% due to neck pain and 23% due to shoulder pain.  Pain neuroscience education (PNE) has been shown as an effective treatment strategy in increasing knowledge and understanding of neurobiology, neurophysiology and pain processing, modifying beliefs about it, improving patient skills and encouraging to the accomplishment of physical and social activities in different chronic pathologies.

Randomised Trial of 3 Artemisinin Combination Therapy for Malaria in Pregnancy This is a randomised, open label trial, comparing standard dose of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) with standard fixed artesunate-mefloquine regimen (MAS3) and with a longer regimen of artemether-lumefantrine (ALN+) in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnant women. The sample size is 335 women in each arm which would be 1005 women in total. Pregnant patients in 2nd and 3rd trimester with acute uncomplicated malaria who meet eligibility criteria will be asked to participate in the study. The primary objective is to determine if the efficacy of DP and MAS3 are superior to ALN+ in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy. The study will also incorporate a dense pharmacokinetic study of mefloquine and artesunate (15 women in the MAS3 arm) and a population pharmacokinetic study for mefloquine, piperaquine and lumefantrine.
Sero-epidemiological Survey of England in 2019/2020 - COVID-19 This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of establishing a national sero-epidemiological survey in England in individuals aged 0-24 years, focusing on assessing humoral immunity against diphtheria, Group C invasive meningococcus and SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will recruit 2800 to 3800 individuals, divided into three groups:  Group one (N= 2300):  This will include all age groups (0-24years), with recruitment restricted by postcodes provided by Public Health England (PHE) to recruit a representative population for the region as assessed by the IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation scores).  Group two (N= up to 1200):  This group has been added following additional funding to enhance the sample size in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This will recruit 0-19 year olds and will not be restricted by post code sampling. Instead recruitment will be by public promotion within the normal recruiting regions for each site.  Group three (N= up to 300):  Addition of Group 3 which is enhanced surveillance in participants from Black, Asian or minority ethnic groups (BAME). Since the start of recruitment we have noted that only 11% of participants are from BAME population, despite recruiting in ethnically diverse regions. Given the increased risk of COVID-19 disease in the BAME community, this is a potential limitation of the study as it stands, not only because it may not reflect the diversity of the UK population, but because it does not allow assessment of whether the differing disease rates and seropositivity in adults are reflected in differences in seropositivity rates in children. Similarly to Group 2, this will recruit 0-19 year olds and will not be restricted by post code sampling.
Acupuncture and Insulin Doses in Insulin-treated Type 2 Diabetes This study is a randomized, single blinded, cross-over interventional study for evaluating the effect of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in diabetic type 2 patient in insulin treatment. Primary end-point of the study is the difference of daily units of insulin between treatment and control group; secondary end point are the variation of glycated hemoglobin levels, lipids panel (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides), C reactive protein and adiponectin. Variation of epicardial fat thickness will be also evaluated by echography.

The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of clinical pharmacy activities during entire care pathways of patients implanted with a PICC line, in preventing complications.
An International Study on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Guided Brachytherapy in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Background:  The standard treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer is radio-chemotherapy including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT) and concomitant chemotherapy with weekly Cisplatin. While image based conformal EBRT is routinely used, prescription and reporting of BT is still based on specific dose points defined in 2D. Thus, for several decades the BT dose has most often been prescribed and reported to the Manchester point A defined according to different traditions.  Recently, a working group from GEC-ESTRO has published recommendations on contouring of tumour target and organs at risk (OAR) as well as on dose volume parameters to be reported for image guided BT in definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer. These recommendations are mainly derived from retrospective single institution experience with MRI based intracavitary BT. The major advantage of this technique is the possibility to conform the dose given by BT with regard to both volume (3D) and time (4D). Thus, by repetitive imaging performed before each BT implant it is possible adapt the dose given by BT to the anatomy of each individual patient taking into account not only the position of OAR but also the tumour regression which often is obtained by preceding EBRT and chemotherapy. Based on the experience collected so far, the image based BT approach is expected to have a major impact on the clinical outcome with a concomitant decrease in the rates of both local failure and morbidity.  Aims:  * To introduce MRI based 3D-4D BT in locally advanced cervical cancer in a multicenter setting within the frame of a prospective observational study. * To establish a bench-mark for clinical outcome with image based BT in a large patient population with respect to local control, survival, morbidity and QoL * To establish a reference material with regard to image based DVH parameters according to the guidelines from the GEC ESTRO working group. * To correlate image based DVH parameters for CTV and for OAR with outcome * To develop prognostic and predictive statistical models for clinical outcome including volumetric, dosimetric, clinical and biological risk factors * To establish radiobiological parameter estimates that will allow a precise risk estimation in individual patients and aid in the development of new treatment protocols

Targeting Potassium Channels to Reprogram Glioblastoma Microenvironment: in Vitro and in Vivo Studies The investigators want to verify the hypothesis that targeting the calcium-activated (KCa3.1) and the voltage-dependent K channel (Kv1.3) could be a valuable therapeutic strategy to reprogram cells of the innate immune system, with the aim to fight glioma, a deadly CNS tumor. The investigators will use murine models of glioma, injecting GL261 cells in the brain of syngeneic C57BL6 mice, to study the effect of K channel inhibition on the activation of microglia (M), macrophages (Mf) and NK cells. The investigators will use M and vesicles released from these cells, re-educated toward an anti-tumor phenotype, to interfere with the vicious circle responsible of uncontrolled tumor growth and will study the role of NK cells in tumor-M/Mf communication. The investigators will also investigate how K channels interfere with the communication of innate immune cells and brain cells like neurons and astrocytes, with experiments focused on synaptic transmission and calcium imaging, investigating the effect of modulation of the tumor microenvironment.
Recovering Damaged Cells for Sequelae Caused by COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple system function disorders, and complicated symptoms last for an extended period.

The Use of Breathing Synchronized PET/CT Imaging In the Detection and Quantification of FDG Uptake in Lung Nodules The purpose of this study is to see if researchers can improve the detection of lung cancer by using a new method which will help us to take multiple snapshot images of the lungs while the patient is breathing. We are also investigating whether with the help of this new method we can better measure the actual amount of radioactivity that is taken up by the cancer. The name of this new method is respiratory gated PET/CT. Previous research has shown that PET scans may be useful in investigating whether cancer has spread to other parts of the lung or body. Using our standard method, smaller cancers are sometimes difficult to detect in the lungs because the PET images are taken over several minutes and the patient is breathing during that time. That means the cancer may appear "blurred" on the images (like a poor photograph) or may not be identified at all. In this study, in addition to the images that were ordered by your doctor, we will take additional images of your lungs while you are following a breathing command ("breath in-hold-breath out"). We will then compare the images of your cancer during the regular PET study with those taken during the breathing commands.  The hypotheses to be tested in this pilot study are:  1. Respiratory gated image acquisition reduces partial volume effects on PET image that may render lung lesions undetectable. 2. Breath-hold CT may detect small lung lesions that are beyond the limit of detection in shallow-breathing CT scans, related to respiratory motion which causes blurring artifacts around smaller lung lesions.
Prospective, Controlled, Randomized Multicentric Study on the Management of the Vesical Catheter in Colon Surgery. INTRODUCTION: Recommendations for peroperative bladder catheterization remain a controversial issue since it is a procedure that is not without complications. Most of the current suggestions derive from open surgery data that have been extrapolated to Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) or Fast-Track programs ranging between 24-48 hours.  The objective of the present study is to find the perfect balance with a better degree of evidence than the current one between the reduction of the probing time and the non-increase of the acute retention of urine in the patients operated in a programmed way of laparoscopic colon surgery.  Methods: Multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized non-inferiority study on the management of the bladder catheter in patients undergoing scheduled laparoscopic colon surgery, randomized in two study groups: experimental group (removal of the bladder catheter after surgery ) and control group (removal of the catheter at 24 hours) after the surgical intervention.  The main objective of the present study is to reduce the permanence of the bladder catheter trying to find the balance of the probing time and the non-increase of the acute retention of urine in the patients operated in a programmed way of laparoscopic colon surgery As secondary objectives we will consider the decrease in the incidence of urinary tract infections within the first 30 days as well as the reduction in hospital stay and morbidity related to the bladder catheter.
Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale and Epilepsy The cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities are crucial endpoints in epileptic patients. Among these comorbidities, the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) accounts for one of the most important in terms of frequency and psychosocial and educational consequences.  In these conditions, our study was designed to estimate the sensitivity to changes of the different sub-scores of the ADHD rating Scale IV (ADHD RS IV) in epileptic patient. This will then optimize our methodological approach for a therapeutic trial.

Trial of Mesalamine for the Treatment of Active Microscopic Colitis Subjects must be 18 years old and older, have diarrhea and microscopic colitis. Pregnant or nursing females are excluded. They can't have other untreated diarrheal conditions. Subjects will receive medication for 8 weeks, followed by sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. The subjects will be monitored weekly. A pathologist will review pre and post treatment biopsies. Subjects that show improvement will be followed for 4 weeks post medication.
Effect of Preoperative Tamsulosin on Postoperative Urinary Retention Approximately 25-30% of patients experience postoperative urinary retention after female pelvic surgery with mid-urethral sling placement. These patients are discharged home with a foley catheter for a few days. Despite being common, many patients consider being discharged home with a foley catheter as a complication of surgery and as the worst part of their experience. Previous studies have demonstrated that 3-5 days of preoperative tamsulosin (a safe and low-cost medication) have been shown to improve postoperative urinary retention rates. Although it takes tamsulosin 5 days to reach a steady-state in a patient, it reaches peak blood volume in 4-5 hours in a fasting patient. The effect of a single dose of preoperative tamsulosin on postoperative urinary retention has not been studied, however would be substantially easier for patients than multiple days of preoperative doses. In this study, the investigators would like to give patients preoperative tamsulosin versus placebo. The investigators would then evaluate for postoperative urinary retention. Previous studies have demonstrated a postoperative urinary retention rate decrease of 65-88% after various tamsulosin protocols. However, the effect of single preoperative dose of tamusloin on postoperative urinary retention has yet to be studied in female pelvic surgery. The investigators hypothesize that a single preoperative dose of tamsulosin will decrease the number of patients with postoperative urinary retention and therefore discharged with a foley catheter. Our goal is to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction postoperatively.
Comitial Prophylaxis in Neurosurgery in Patients Who Have Undergone Intracranial Surgery Programmed Supratentorial Surgery (Exeresis or Biopsy) Between 2019 and 2022 JUSTIFICATION Anti-epileptic prophylaxis has long been a systematic practice for supra-tentorial intracranial surgeries. Since 2021, European guidelines no longer recommend this prophylaxis and practices have evolved.  We therefore propose to compare epileptic seizure's occurrence in the first postoperative month between two groups of neurosurgical patients.The first group consists of patients treated between January 2019 and late 2020 who were given systematic prophylaxis. Patients from the second group were treated between 2021 and 2022 and did not receive any prophylaxis.  The secondary objective will consist in identifying the number of patients placed on prophylaxis, the length of prophylaxis, treatment's side effects (depression, elevated liver enzymes...), and comparing patients' neurological outcome at 3 and 6 months after surgical procedures.

It is planned to select 206 cases of subjects with small coronary artery vessel disease who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. They are randomly divide them into Biolimus release coronary balloon catheter treatment group and plain old balloon angioplasty catheter (Powerline) treatment group according to the ratio of 1:1. All subjects accept clinical follow-up after operation, at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after operation. Follow-up with angiography is conducted at 9 months. The late lumen loss in diseased segment at 9 months after operation is the primary endpoint.
Drug Biomarkers in Cell Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia RATIONALE: Studying cell samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer  PURPOSE: This research study is studying drug biomarkers in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management Through the Emergency Department In the US, children from minority ethnic and racial backgrounds suffer disproportionately from asthma and account for substantially more emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations than non-minority children. While NHLBI guidelines recommend daily preventive medications for all children with persistent asthma to prevent morbidity as well as ED visits and hospitalizations, many children who should receive preventive medications are not receiving them. This is in part because children presenting to the ED for an acute asthma exacerbation rarely receive preventive asthma care, due to the ED's focus on acute, episodic care. The NHLBI guidelines recommend that children follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) within 1-4 weeks of the ED visit. The post-ED follow-up visit is an opportunity for the PCP to prescribe effective preventive asthma medications, step-up medication for children who demonstrate poor control, promote adherence, and provide education on asthma self-management and trigger control. However, rates for follow-up after an asthma-related ED visit are extremely low, and preventive care is delivered inconsistently even when children are seen in follow-up. In the investigators' prior work they have found that a provider prompting intervention can enhance the delivery of guideline-based preventive asthma treatments at the time of a primary care office visit and ultimately reduce morbidity. They have also found that telemedicine can link children with persistent asthma to a provider for optimal chronic illness management. The goal of this project is to use a novel telemedicine-based program to facilitate primary care follow-up and promote the delivery of guideline-based preventive care for high-risk children presenting to the ED for an asthma exacerbation. The investigators will utilize a 2-group randomized trial to test the TEAM-ED intervention. The intervention includes: 1) a telemedicine assessment at the child's school within one week of discharge from the ED and completed by a PCP, 2) 'point-of-care' prompting to promote the provision of guideline-based preventive care during the telemedicine visit, and 3) two additional telemedicine-assisted follow-up assessments to assure optimal response to treatment and tailor the care regimen as needed. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of the program in reducing respiratory morbidity and improving preventive asthma care, with follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Immunoadsorption and Intravenous Immunoglobulin for Guillain-Barre Syndrome Guillain-Barre syndrome is an immune-mediated acute inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. The currently effective treatment methods include intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. Immunoadsorption has been widely used to treat immune-related diseases. There are currently no prospective large-sample clinical trials of immunoadsorption therapy for Guillain-Barre syndrome. The neuro-intensive care unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University is preparing to carry out a prospective, multi-center, randomized parallel controlled clinical study on the efficacy and safety of protein A immunoadsorption and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is estimated that 204 patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome will be included. The patients will be randomly assigned to the immunoadsorption group and the IVIG group. The primary outcome measure: changes in Hughes scores (4 weeks after starting treatment vs. baseline (before starting treatment) ). This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of protein A immunoadsorption and intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome.

A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine (Called Tofacitinib) in People With Psoriatic Arthritis The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine for the potential treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Psoriatic Arthritis is a joint swelling disease that can also affect the skin, nails and eyes. The study medicine is called Tofacitinib. This study is seeking participants who:  * Started taking tofacitinib alone or with other approved medicines (eg. methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, apremilast) for PsA disease. We will only look at participants' who started tofacitinib after December 14, 2017. * Have a 6-month follow-up visit (with a 3-month window) This is an observational study. Participants receiving Tofacitinib will be included to assess how well tofacitinib works. We will look at participants' demographic information and therapy history. We will also monitor participants' disease progression before and 6 months after treatment. We will examine the experiences of people receiving the study medicine. This will help us determine if the study medicine is safe and effective.
Study About Simvastatin in Portal Hypertension in Compensated Cirrhosis The purpose of this study is to determine whether simvastatin is effective in the prevention of progression of porta hypertension in compensated cirrhosis patients.
The Pleiotropic Effects of Atorvastatin When Combined With Common Antihypertenisve Medications.

Markers of Alzheimers Disease After Propofol or Isoflurane Anesthesia Previous work in animal models suggests that inhalational anesthetic agents may accelerate Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, but it is unclear to what extent this may happen in humans. Here, the investigators propose to measure Alzheimer's disease-related neural markers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients exposed to anesthesia while undergoing neurosurgical procedures that require lumbar drain placement. Patients will be randomized to either receive inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane or intravenous anesthesia with propofol.  CSF and blood samples will each be collected at the induction of anesthesia, and then again ten and twenty-four hours later. CSF samples will be assayed for amyloid beta, tau, and other Alzheimer's disease-associated markers; blood samples will be assayed for serum inflammatory markers and used for genotyping studies. These studies should clarify the effect of common anesthetic agents on Alzheimer's disease related neural markers.
A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Guselkumab for the Treatment of Participants With Moderate to Severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of guselkumab in adult participants with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
Impact of Monosodium Glutamate on 68GA-PSMA-11, PET Imaging Biodistribution in Patients With Prostate Cancer This phase I trial studies the impact of monosodium glutamate (MSG) on 68GA-PSMA-11 PET/CT in decreasing the salivary glands uptake in patients with prostate cancer. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a molecule that is overexpressed by the prostate cancer cells. 68GA-PSMA-11 is an imaging radioactive drug that can target this molecule in tissues for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer. Food substances, such as monosodium glutamate, may reduce salivary gland uptake of 68GA-PSMA-11. Ultimately, giving MSG may reduce potential harm and injury to the salivary glands in patients with prostate cancer treated with PSMA-targeted molecular radiotherapy.
Study Assessing The "Best of" Radiotherapy vs the "Best of" Surgery in Patients With Oropharyngeal Carcinoma Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) arises in the soft palate, tonsils, base of tongue, pharyngeal wall, and the vallecula. Most of the patients with early stage OPSCC are usually cured. Treatment of early stage OPSCC can be successfully achieved with primary surgery including neck dissection, as indicated, or with definitive radiotherapy. The current standard treatment for OPSCC is therefore based on either surgery and/or radiotherapy, both associated with comparable, high tumor control rates but with different side effects profiles and technical constraints.  In order to decrease the potential morbidity of surgery, transoral approaches have been developed within the last decades, including transoral robotic surgery (TORS), transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) or conventional transoral techniques. On the other hand, patients with head and neck cancer treated with IMRT experienced significant improvements in cause specific survival (CSS) compared with patients treated with non-IMRT techniques thus suggesting that IMRT may be beneficial in terms of patient's outcomes and toxicity profile. It is as yet unclear however, which one of the new techniques is superior to the other in terms of function preservation. Given that the functional outcome of most importance is swallowing function, the preservation of swallowing is thus of major importance.  The main objective of the study is to assess and compare the patient-reported swallowing function over the first year after randomization to either IMRT or TOS among patients with early stage OPSCC, SGSCC, and HPSCC.
Low-Calorie Diets on Type 2 Diabetes Remission The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing rapidly in China. China currently has \~130 million diabetes cases, and over 90% are T2DM. T2DM is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, posing substantial clinical and public health challenges. Reversing T2DM with a significant amount of weight loss via consuming a low-calorie diet is possible, but no studies have been conducted to determine whether low-calorie diets will help achieve significant weight loss and diabetes remission among Chinese patients with T2DM. The investigators design a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a low-calorie diet intervention program on weight loss and diabetes remission in a Chinese population with T2DM.
A Phase II, Double-blinded, Randomized, Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Vitalliver in Patients With Decompensated Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is a diffuse lesion characterized by architectural distortion of the liver because of collagen deposition and development of nodules of regenerating hepatocytes. It is an irreversible change that results from diseases characterized by chronic liver injury (Fujimoto, 2000). Cirrhosis alters the pattern of blood flow through the liver and results in impaired perfusion of hepatic lobules with intrahepatic and extrahepatic shunting of blood. This deprives hepatocytes of uniform perfusion by arterial and portal venous blood resulting in both portal hypertension and other consequences of cirrhosis including impaired protein synthesis and altered drug metabolism. The histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis requires the presence of regenerative nodules or pseudolobules completely encircled by fibrosis such as congenital hepatic fibrosis can result in portal hypertension in the absence of cirrhosis (Anthony et al., 1977).  The events leading to the development of cirrhosis are generally those of chronic injury with hepatocyte destruction. Acute severe liver injury as in fulminant viral hepatitis does not result in cirrhosis and the liver generally returns to normal after recovery. Cirrhosis can be classified by macroscopic appearance, by cause, and by histologic appearance and location of liver damage. Micronodular cirrhosis is composed of uniform nodules less than 3 mm in diameter, whereas macronodular cirrhosis has varying size nodules greater than 3 mm diameter. Mixed nodular cirrhosis has nodules of both sizes. Some liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease may present as micronodular cirrhosis and develop larger nodules with subsequent regeneration of hepatocytes. For this reason, many prefer etiologic classification (e.g., alcoholic cirrhosis). The designation of cirrhosis as post necrotic, biliary and portal are still commonly used and imply predominant histologic location of fibrosis.  Cirrhosis is an irreversible disease, and attempts should be made to stabilize the patient and to control the cause. Factors that indicate a poor outcome include an elevated prothrombin time that does not correct itself with parenteral vitamin K, upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by varices, ascites refractory to therapy, increased age of the patient, sever malnutrition, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, a pronounced increase of serum bilirubin in the absence of haemolysis, and heptocellular carcinoma (Yeh et al., 2003). In general, all causes of upper GI bleeding are associated with an increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis. For those with alcoholic cirrhosis who lack portal hypertension, survival is similar to an age-matched cohort if alcohol intake is stopped (Nakamura et al., 1991). If ethanol consumption continues, mortality is higher. Cirrhosis can be present without clinically significant complications and be identified only at autopsy or during evaluation of abnormal liver tests (Mendez et al., 2003). However, for many patients the disease is slowly progressive resulting in one or more complications. The clinical manifestations of cirrhosis are a result of altered hepatic blood flow through the liver with intrahepatic shunting causing impaired perfusion of hepatocytes or portal hypertension with shunting of blood around the liver though portosystemic communications. The major complications of portal hypertension include oesophageal or gastric varices, ascites, portosystemic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal-syndrome (Menon \& Kamath, 2000). With impairment of hepatocyte perfusion or reduction of hepatocyte number, altered synthetic function can result in hypoalbuminemia, hypoprothrombinemia, and changes in drug metabolism.  Vitalliver is a Chinese medicine which is administered in the form of a suppository, which is uncommon for most Chinese medicines. Medications released from the suppositories are absorbed directly from the circulation around the rectum and then reach the liver via the portal vein.  Basic pharmacological studies have shown that Vitalliver has good immunomodulating functions, increases the activities of T-cells, B-cells and NK cells, therefore this formulation may have special values in treating liver diseases.
Digital Care Programs for Musculoskeletal Health The purpose of this study is to create a research repository, composed of data collected in the course of digital care programs for musculoskeletal conditions and musculoskeletal health delivered by SWORD Health to individuals undergoing those programs.  This will allow the investigators to observe the acceptance, engagement and outcomes of programs using this approach in the treatment of multiple musculoskeletal disorders (MSD).
Lifestyle Control of Postprandial Hyperglycemia Large spikes in blood glucose experienced after meals in people with type 2 diabetes are known to damage blood vessels. Low carbohydrate high fat diets and exercise can improve blood glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes but it is unclear how these two strategies interact to affect blood vessel function and inflammation. We will examine how following a short-term low carbohydrate high fat diet (4 days) with or without post-meal walking impacts markers of blood vessel function and inflammation. We will also examine how a single low carbohydrate high fat meal, with or without post-meal walking, impacts blood glucose control and blood vessel function. Findings will help determine the best lifestyle approach for improving cardiovascular health in type 2 diabetes.
Neurotization of the Nipple Areolar Complex to Restore Sensation for Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Nipple Sparing Mastectomy and Reconstruction This phase II trial tests the willingness of patients undergoing nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) to enroll in a randomized study of NSM with or without neurotization of the nipple areolar complex (NAC). This trial also compares patient reported outcomes, including quality of life and breast and NAC sexual functionality, for patients undergoing NSM with or without neurotization of the NAC. NSM is a standard practice option for patients undergoing preventative mastectomy, but many report dissatisfaction with decreased nipple sensation. Neurotization is a surgical technique using a nerve graft in an attempt to restore NAC sensation. Neurotization during NSM and reconstruction may restore NAC sensation and improve quality of life in breast cancer patients.
Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) and Postoperative Delirium To investigate the impact of cTBS on the incidence of postoperative delirium and changes of cognitive function in elderly patients after surgery. To explore whether short-term cTBS can reduce the risk of postoperative delirium as a preventive strategy.
Combination Therapy With Myo-inositol and Folic Acid Versus Myo-inositol Alone Previous studies have demonstrated that Myo-inositol is capable of restoring spontaneous ovarian activity, and consequently fertility, in most patients with PCOS.

Chemotherapy Selection Based on Therapeutic Targets for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer In recent years, treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer is changing. Currently, there are several active schedules of chemotherapy that can be used, such as gemcitabine as monotherapy or in combination with capecitabine or erlotinib, and FOLFIRINOX. Moreover, the development of biomarker (therapeutic targets) that can predicte response to treatment is a new important tool to be used in clinical practice to select the best scheme for each patient. Preliminary studies showed that therapeutic target determination, using tumor tissue collected from patients, could determine the presence of groups of "chemotherapy responders". Such is the case of EGFR amplification and/or K-Ras gene status and correlation with response to erlotinib. Moreover, Thymidilate Synthase, Thimidine Phosphorylase, ERCC-1 and Topoisomerase I expression by immunohistochemistry in GI tumor samples has been related to resistance or response to 5FU-capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan respectively. Based on this data the investigators designed a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of selected treatment for pancreatic cancer patients based on the determination of therapeutic targets. The therapeutic target-driven treatment efficacy will be compared to the prospective treatment of a control group of patients treated at the discretion of the physician-researcher

Managing Young People With ADHD in Primary Care Study Background:  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood neurodevelopmental disorder. It affects around 5% of children and adolescents, and up to 40% continue to experience symptoms into adulthood. Primary care practitioners (e.g., general practitioners (GPs), nurses, link workers, clinical pharmacists) play an important role in the healthcare of young people (YP) with ADHD, particularly due to long waiting times in adult mental health services, and patchy provision of specialist services. However, many practitioners feel unsure about how to support YP at this vulnerable stage in their lives. Practitioners report concerns about prescribing ADHD medication and a desire for more guidance. Currently, little is known about how YP with ADHD are supported in primary care, the strengths and weakness of existing care pathways, and how care can be improved.  Aims:  To provide an evidence-base by mapping current services, and co-produce guidance to improve and better co-ordinate primary care for YP aged 16-25 with ADHD.  Methods:  Three interlinked studies. A mapping study including a national survey of stakeholders to map patient pathways, prescribing practice, shared-care arrangements, and practitioner roles. A qualitative study including semi-structured interviews with YP and practitioners, to gain insight into experiences of 'what works' and 'what is needed'. Workshops to co-develop a map of patient pathways, key messages, and clinical guidance.  Patient Involvement:  This research has been developed in response to identified gaps in services, and requests from people with ADHD. The team includes young people with ADHD whose input will help ensure the research is sensitive and relevant, and an academic GP to ensure identified solutions are deliverable within primary care settings.  Impact:  The expected impact of this research is improvement of the quality and experience of care for YP with ADHD. Also, to improve experiences of primary care providers facing difficulties managing ADHD.

Kinematic Analysis: Posterior Stabilized, Fixed Bearing Total Knee Arthroplasty With Attune Knee System - Phase 2 A better understanding of knee joint kinematics is important to explain the premature polyethylene wear failures within total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) and to help design a prosthesis that most closely approximates the normal knee. Specifically, posterior stabilizing (PS) knees have been found to be associated with lower amounts of posterior femoral rollback, higher occurrence of reverse axial rotation and increased amount of condylar lift-off. The DePuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction's Attune PS fixed bearing (FB) knee system has incorporated subtle changes in its design to address restoration of kinematics that more closely resemble those of a normal knee. To understand if this design is able to effectively restore kinematics in the implanted knee, further in vivo analysis is necessary. This continuation of the study will analyze 30 subjects with the Attune PS FB 3 months post-operatively using the University of Tennessee's mobile fluoroscopy unit while performing three daily activities, level walking, ramp down and deep knee bend.

Enhanced and Attendance-based Prize CM in Community Settings The purpose of this study is to address the conditions under which prize contingency management (CM) for abstinence and attendance may improve outcomes of cocaine-dependent patients.  For patients who initiate treatment with a cocaine-positive urine specimen, we will evaluate the efficacy of two CM procedures relative to standard, non-CM treatment. The two CM procedures will be provided as additions to standard care and will reinforce drug abstinence but will differ in expected magnitudes of prizes patients can earn, especially during early stages of abstinence. They will provide expected magnitudes of winning about $250 and $560, respectively. We expect that both CM conditions will improve retention and abstinence relative to the standard treatment, non-CM condition. If the enhanced CM condition engenders better outcomes than the $250 CM condition, this finding would suggest that patients initiating treatment while actively using cocaine may best be treated with relatively high reinforcement prize CM as an adjunct to standard care.  For patients who initiate treatment with a cocaine-negative urine specimen, we will evaluate the efficacy of a CM procedure that reinforces treatment attendance. The expected magnitude of winnings will be about $250, and again CM treatment will be in addition to standard care. This CM condition will be compared to standard treatment without CM as well as to a CM treatment that provides a similar magnitude of reinforcement, but contingent upon abstinence. Results from this study will inform an important clinical question of whether simply reinforcing attendance can improve clinical outcomes. Increased retention may result in greater exposure to therapeutic processes that may reduce drug use, especially among patients who begin treatment having already achieved some abstinence. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CM by examining the effects of the interventions on hospitalizations, medical and psychiatric care, criminal justice costs, and productivity.
Empowerment, Motivation and Medical Adherence (EMMA). Outcomes in type 2 diabetes are largely achieved by self-management efforts by individuals living with diabetes. Diabetes self-management is typically provided using the principles of adult education. Current evidence suggests that standard educational interventions are suboptimal. This study evaluates a novel approach to diabetes self-management using dialogue tools based on empowerment and motivational communication methods. The approach evaluated in this study is called EMMA: empowerment, motivation and medical adherence. Participants will be randomized to EMMA and treatment as usual, treated for a period of 4 months and evaluated over a period of 12 months.

Reducing Dietary Acid With Food Versus Oral Alkali in People With Chronic Kidney Disease (ReDACKD) Metabolic acidosis is a common problem that occurs with worsening chronic kidney disease. Dietary acid can build up when the kidneys are not working well. This can be associated with a higher risk of worsening kidney function and death. The usual treatment is a medication called sodium bicarbonate which works to balance the acids in the body. The medication however often does not work and causes side effects. Consumption of alkalizing fruit and vegetables may work as a treatment for metabolic acidosis. This trial is being done to see if fruit and vegetables, provided via home delivery, can become a viable management for metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Local Vibration in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Gastrocnemius spasticity is one of the main complaints in Multiple Sclerosis patients.Local muscle vibration is a method used for spasticity inhibition. However, when the studies in the literature are examined; It is noted that local vibration applications for spasticity are usually single sessions and evaluate the acute effect, do not produce functional outputs, there is no consensus on frequency and amplitude and the changes in muscle architecture are not examined. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of local vibration applied on spastic gastrocnemius on muscle architectural and functional properties in Multiple Sclerosis patients in addition to the standard physiotherapy program. The study was planned to include 3 groups, 2 treatment and 1 control group. The control group will receive standard physiotherapy, one of the treatment groups will receive 50 Hz local vibration in addition to standard physiotherapy, and other treatment group will receive 100 Hz local vibration in addition to standard physiotherapy. Disease severity, gastrocnemius spasticity, architectural and viscoelastic properties of muscle, ankle proprioception, balance and gait skills will be evaluated before and after 8 weeks treatment program. As a result; effectiveness of local vibration in addition to standard physiotherapy program and whether there is a difference between applications at different frequencies will be examined.
Outcomes After Chiropractic Spinal Manipulative Therapy With Lumbar Disc Herniation and Radiculopathy In a study that was approved nine years ago (EK-22/2009) we could show (i) that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is a very effective and safe treatment for acute and chronic lumbar disc herniation (LDH); (ii) that SMT is as effective and less expensive than lumbar nerve root injections and (iii) that the recurrence rate up to one year was very low in acute and in chronic LDH patients. However, the long-term outcome of this conservatively treated LDH patients is unknown. Thus, the objective of this amendment is to investigate the proportion of long-term recurrences in these patients who were treated with SMT for their LDH and to compare these results with already existing data from other treatments, e.g. surgery. This is important information to know whether this conservative method is a sustainable approach for treating LDH.
Reversal With Low Doses of Sugammadex in Patients Undergoing Non-cardiac Surgery Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are among the most commonly used drugs during general anesthesia and may induce complete muscle paralysis.They are used clinically to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to optimize surgical working conditions. Incomplete recovery from non-depolarising NMBAs continues to be a common problem in modern postoperative care unit and is associated with significant risk of microaspiration and hypoventilation which leads to pulmonary complications.Recently effective reversal of neuromuscular blockade has been described by use of lower dose of sugammadex the recommended without providing adequate answer to whether the lower dose is safe enough to avoid recurrent block.  Hypotheses:  1. Administration of sugammadex 0.25 mg/kg at TOF ratio 0.3 will successfully reverse (TOF=0.9) rocuronium induced neuromuscular block within 10 min. 2. Recurrent block (TOF ratio \< 0.9) does not occur after reversal with low dose sugammadex 0.25 mg/kg.  The primary objective of this trial is to assess the dose-response characteristics of sugammadex in reversing rocuronium induced neuromuscular block and to identify the minimal effective dose  Secondary objective is to assess the safety of different doses of sugammadex (recurrent block (TOF ratio \< 0.9) after reversal and the occurrence of adverse reactions)  Sugammadex is a very expensive drug which limits its use i anaesthesia department. By optimising drug dosage it may have economic impact and contribute to a wider use of sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular block before extubation and thus avoid incomplete recovery. This may lead to less risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality after surgery.
International Termination of Resuscitation Practices Neither the international nor the interregional variation in survival following OHCA is fully understood, but may rely on multiple factors such as: organization of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the use of Automatic External Defibrillators (AED's), response time, and which subgroups are included as the denominator, (i.e. obvious dead, withholding of resuscitation). Variation in denominators provide an obstacle when comparing outcome between different EMS-systems. Studies have found that Utstein factors explained half of the variation in survival to hospital discharge among different EMS agencies highlighting the importance of further research.  Due to the high mortality rate of OHCA, the decision of withholding or withdrawing resuscitative efforts must be made frequently. We find that a description of the differences in initiation and termination of resuscitation of adult patients (\>18 years of age), suffering from non-traumatic OHCA could add an important perspective on the impact of differences in EMS systems across the World regarding the outcome following OHCA.
Analysis of CA-MRSA Transmission: An ED Population Sampling Strategy Given that the Emergency Department (ED) has become the entry way for large populations of patients into the health care system, a strategy of sampling MRSA isolates in ED populations and merging this information with patient-level data may present a window to hypothesize and investigate CA-MRSA transmission within the community and its impact on hospital-acquired infections.
Effect of Dapagliflozin on Microvascular Function in Women With Symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effects of a drug (in the drug class called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) in women who have symptoms of ischemic heart disease. The main questions the study aims to answer are:  Does blood flow in the heart improve with study drug?  Participants will be randomly assigned to a 12-week course of the study drug, dapagliflozin 10mg, or placebo. Blood flow in the heart will be assessed using stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 12 weeks. The researchers will compare the results from the two groups.
Mirror Therapy: Effects on Functional Recuperation of Severe Upper Limb Paresis After Stroke After stroke, patients frequently suffer from arm or hand weakness. There are numerous rehabilitation methods to stimulate recovery, amongst which mirror therapy (MT). It is particularly interesting in cases for which impairment is severe, as many other forms of therapy are often impossible.  During MT, a mirror is placed in the midsagittal plane, so as to hide the impaired limb. Thereafter, the subject is asked to move his unimpaired limb while looking at its reflection in the mirror, thereby creating the illusion that the contralateral, impaired limb is moving.  The objective of this study is to better determine the efficacy of MT. The investigators will therefore compare recovery of arm function in two groups of patient, that perform a regimen of 30 minutes of therapy, 5 times a week, for 4 weeks on top of conventional therapy. One group performs MT and the other one performs a therapy in which the same movements are performed, but without the use of a mirror, with unrestricted view of both limbs. Allocation to each group will be randomized. Arm function will be evaluated by use of a scale before, during and after the 4 week period. The assessor for the primary outcome measure will not know in which group the patient is. There will be a total of 30 patients included over a one year study period.

Stress and Sugar Synergy The main objectives of this study are to test the hypotheses that: 1) consumption of beverages sweetened with sucrose will increase risk factors for cardiovascular disease to a greater extent than a naturally-sweetened fruit juice such as orange juice, and 2) chronic psychological stress may augment the adverse metabolic effects of sugar intake. The study intervention consists of 2-week's consumption of 25% of energy as sugar provided either as a sucrose-sweetened beverage or naturally-sweetened orange juice.
Effect of Protein Consumption and Resistance Training on Body Composition, Muscular Strength and Functional Capacity in the Elderly The increase in life expectancy of the world population is associated with a higher incidence of diseases, leading to functional incapacity and dependence in old age. Aging is usually accompanied by progressive loss of muscle mass, muscular strength and functional capacity, possibly exacerbated by inactivity and low protein and energy consumption of elderly individuals. However, the response to strength training, as well as the daily recommendation of protein and other factors related to sarcopenia in this population seem not to be well understood. Objective: To evaluate the effect of protein intake and resistance training on body composition, muscle strength and functional capacity in the elderly. METHODS: A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial will be conducted with 38 elderly people, ≥ 60 years old, sedentary, and body mass index between 22 and 30 kg / m2. All those who agree to participate will be randomized into two groups (intervention or placebo) and will undergo an initial assessment consisting of food consumption analysis through the application of the three-day food record, assessment of muscle thickness of the thigh and arm by muscle ultrasonography, evaluation of body composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), dynamic maximal strength (1RM) test of knee extension and elbow flexion, peak torque test of knee extension, functional capacity tests and quality of life questionnaire (SF-36). The elderly will participate in resistance training for 12 weeks, two session per week. The intervention group will be supplemented with whey protein isolate (2x / day - 20g for breakfast and 20g for dinner) and the placebo group will receive maltodextrin (2x / day - 20g for breakfast and 20g for dinner). All outcomes will be assessed before and after the 12-week resistance training period.

Selective Early Medical Treatment of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Extremely Low Gestational Age Infants: A Pilot RCT Background: Among preterm infants, those born at a gestational age less than 26 weeks are considered the most vulnerable with a high risk of short- and long-term health problems that include chronic lung disease, brain bleeds, gut injury, kidney failure and death. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common heart condition with almost 70% preterm infants in this gestational age group being diagnosed with a PDA. Though many PDAs spontaneously resolve on their own, research suggests that if the PDA persists, it may contribute to a number of these short- and long-term health problems. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen are commonly used to treat a PDA. Such drugs can also have harmful effects on the gut and kidneys of extremely preterm infants. Therefore, we are unsure if early treatment of a symptomatic PDA in this age group is at all beneficial. Given the wide variation in PDA treatment approaches in this age group, a randomized trial design, where extremely preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA are randomly assigned to early treatment or no early treatment, is essential to address this question.  Purpose of the study: The overall purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a large study to explore the following research question: In preterm infants born \<26 weeks' gestation, is a strategy of selective early medical treatment of a symptomatic PDA better than no treatment at all in the first week of life?  The main feasibility objectives of this study are:  1. To assess how many eligible infants can be enrolled in the study 2. To assess how many enrolled infants properly complete the study protocol  Importance: To our knowledge this will be the first study on PDA management in preterm infants that specifically aims to enroll preterm infants born at \<26 weeks of gestational age who are at the highest risk for PDA-related problems but have been mostly under-represented in previous PDA studies.
Clinical and Genetic Studies in Families With Myopia and Related Diseases This study will examine the inheritance of myopia in families of various nationalities and ethnic backgrounds to identify gene changes that cause myopia or similar diseases and to better understand these conditions. In patients with myopia, the eye does not focus light accurately on the retina (tissue that lines the back of the eye), so that objects at a distance appear blurry. Myopia may occur alone, with other vision problems such as retinal dislocations, cataract or glaucoma, or with other problems such as joint or skin problems.  People with myopia (usually those from families with several affected members) and control subjects with normal vision may be eligible for this study.  Each participant undergoes the following procedures:  * Blood draw for genetic testing related to the disorders under study * Medical and family history, including drawing a family tree to explore vision problems in the family * Complete eye examination, including refraction (pupil dilation) and visual acuity testing, photographs of the retina and possibly lens, and specialized tests to measure field of vision, color vision and ability to see in the dark

A Multicenter Observational Study of Invasive Candida Infections Among ICU Patients in China The incidence of invasive candida infection (ICI) in critically ill patients is increasing day by day. The crude mortality of IFI in ICU could be as high as 25%-75% depending on their age, underlying conditions, and so on. Candida albicans was by far the predominant species in most countries, causing up to two thirds of all cases of invasive candidiasis. However, a shift toward non-albicans Candida species has been observed. Although the studies of ICI cause universal attention recently, there is still no large-scale, multi-center epidemiological research in China focusing on ICI in critically ill patients, therefore we conducted a large-scale multi-center observational study of IFI in critically ill patients named "China Scan" (CHINA Survey of Candidiasis in ICU) to assess the current incidence, mortality, pathogen spectrum, management, and risk factors for ICI in China ICUs.

The secondary objectives were to compare progression-free survival, to evaluate overall response rate, to evaluate the safety profile, to assess immunogenicity of intravenous (IV) aflibercept, and to assess pharmacokinetics of IV aflibercept in both treatment arms.
Rho Kinase in Patients With Atherosclerosis The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor), United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs commonly prescribed by doctors to lower cholesterol, on certain functions of platelets (cells that cause blood clots), white blood cells (cells that are responsible for inflammation), and blood flow regulation by arteries. This is important because we are looking at ways to more effectively prevent atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in blood vessels) and heart disease. Many studies have demonstrated that these drugs are effective at reducing inflammation and stabilizing plaques. We are interested in better understanding the effects of these medicines on inflammation (pain and swelling) and the mechanism by which they act.  Hypothesis: Atorvastatin (40mg) will reduce inflammatory markers and activity more than Rosuvastatin (10mg) in spite of equal LDL-C reduction.
Usability of Blood Glucose Control With the Space TGC System in Medical ICU Patients Hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients and associated with an adverse outcome. Thus, glycaemic control is an important issue in critical care. Despite extensive efforts of the intensive care unit staff difficulties were experienced in achieving efficient and safe glucose control. A fully automated algorithm may help to overcome some of these limitations by excluding intuitive interventions and integrating relevant clinical data in the decision-making process. Space GlucoseControl (TGC system) is a decision support system which helps to achieve safe and reliable blood glucose control in the desired ranges. Information on parenteral and enteral nutrition is automatically integrated into the calculations. The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the performance and usability of the Space TGC system for glucose control in medical ICU patients.

Evaluation of the Peripheral Nerve Ultrasound as a Diagnostic Tool in CANVAS Neuropathies Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder with a slowly progressive ataxia. It's genetic causative etiology with an autosomal recessive inheritance has a recent discovery.  It is clinically characterized by impaired visually enhanced vestibulo-ocular reflex, although patients commonly present with imbalance as a main concern, associated with sensory complaints. It has been demonstrated that sensory impairment in CANVAS patients is due to degeneration of dorsal root with abnormal sensory nerve conduction.  Previously defined diagnostic criteria included cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI, neuronopathy on electrophysiological studies and negative genetic testing for other inherited ataxia syndromes like Friedriech ataxia and spinal cerebellar ataxia (SCA).  Peripheral nerve ultrasound is a noninvasive technique, able to identify abnormal peripheral nerves with underlying injuries and specific sonographic characteristics. Pelosi et al established that patients with CANVAS have a smaller nerve cross sectional area (CSA) compared to healthy individuals and/ or axonal neuropathies.  The main objective of this study was to obtaine a detailed description of peripheral nerves in consecutive patients with CANVAS syndrome followed in theneurology department of the Universitary Hospital of Nimes (France), using conventional electrophysiology and peripheral nerve ultrasound.

Effectiveness of Water Exercises on Isokinetic Muscle Strength The interest in studying the impact of aquatic exercise on muscle strength of patients with rheumatoid arthritis came after publication of several studies that pointed to the potential benefit of exercise on the natural history of the disease, including reduction of pain, better immune response as well as aerobic fitness and functional capacity and increase muscle strength, endurance and quality of life.  In general, the aquatic exercises are indicated for patients with chronic joint diseases, since the aquatic environment seems to be more secure for this population due to the reduction of joint loading, as well as gain range of motion.  However, there are some difficulties to show the real and consistent beneficial effect of physical activity in these patients, such as the small number of randomized controlled clinical trials, short intervention period (4-8 weeks), lack of details of the exercise protocols used, methodological problems (heterogeneous measures to evaluate the outcome, change of medication). Moreover, no study evaluated the disease activity, according to the tool most used clinically worldwide, the DAS28.  It is known that aquatic exercises without impact in healthy subjects are sufficient to gain muscle strength. Nonetheless, in people with joint limitation the benefits from these same exercises to gain muscle strength is not known.  To date, no studies addressing the effect of aquatic exercise on muscle strength and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, there is the need to obtain a standardized protocol for prescribing of aquatic exercises. The choice of lower-limb strength was based on its relevance to the acceleration and deceleration during the march, as well as to perform activities of daily living, leisure and professional in these individuals.  Thus, this study aims at:  1. Exercises performed in the aquatic environment and without the concomitant use of overhead equipment are sufficient to promote gain muscle strength in the lower limb? 2. What is the isolated effect of water resistance on muscle strength? Could it work as an impact that is used in exercises done on the land?

Neurovascular Transduction During Exercise in Chronic Kidney Disease The purpose of this study is to find out why patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have poor exercise capacity and to explore what causes an increase in blood pressure during exercise (i.e. increased adrenaline levels, or decreased ability of blood vessels to dilate). This study will also test whether or not regular exercise on a bicycle and/or treatment with 6R-BH4 (Kuvan) pills, or histidine and beta-alanine supplementation improves these measures during exercise. 6R-BH4 is currently FDA-approved for use in patients with certain forms of a disease called phenylketonuria, but it is not currently FDA approved for blood pressure or exercise capacity in people with CKD.
Capecitabine and Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer This study is for patients with colorectal cancer that has spread and has increased in size after standard treatments. This study is being done to find out how long it takes their tumors to grow after treatment with the chemotherapy drugs capecitabine and gemcitabine. Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of colorectal cancer. We are adding another drug (called gemcitabine), which is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer of the pancreas to see if the ability of capecitabine to shrink tumors can be improved by adding gemcitabine. The side effects of the combination will also be evaluated. Another purpose of this study is to measure the levels of certain substances that affect how the body reacts to the chemotherapy agents in cancer cells (in the tumor). In addition, the genes (which are the cell's blueprint for these substances) will also be evaluated in the blood.

Detection of Colonic Polyps Via a Large Scale Artificial Intelligence (AI) System Colonoscopy is the gold standard for detection and removal of precancerous lesions, and has been amply shown to reduce mortality. However, the miss rate for polyps during colonoscopies is 22-28%, while 20-24% of the missed lesions are histologically confirmed precancerous adenomas. To address this shortcoming, the investigators propose a new polyp detection system based on deep learning, which can alert the operator in real-time to the presence and location of polyps during a colonoscopy. The investigators dub the system DEEP: (DEEP) DEtection of Elusive Polyps. The DEEP system was trained on 3,611 hours of colonoscopy videos derived from two sources, and was validated on a set comprising 1,393 hours of video, coming from a third, unrelated source. For the validation set, the ground truth labelling was provided by offline gastroenterologist annotators, who were able to watch the video in slow-motion and pause/rewind as required; two or three specialist annotators examined each video.  This is a prospective, non-blinded, non-randomized pilot study of patients undergoing elective screening and surveillance colonoscopies using DEEP.  The aim of the study is to:  Assess the:  1. Number of additional polyps detected by the DEEP system in real time colonoscopy. 2. Safety by prospective assessment of the rate of adverse events during the study period attributed or not to the use of the DEEP system. 3. Stability of the DEEP system by measuring the rate of false positives (False Alarms) per colonoscopies 4 And to examine its feasibility and usefulness of in clinical practice by assessing the colonoscopist user experience while using the DEEP system in a 5 point scale.

Dietary Protein and Insulin Sensitivity Study The overall objective of the Dietary Protein and Insulin Sensitivity Study is to test the hypothesis that increased protein in a diet with reduced carbohydrate (35% energy) can ameliorate insulin resistance in the absence of weight loss, and that this effect is independent of saturated fat content. Moreover, we will test whether such diets result in beneficial changes in total LDL cholesterol, small, dense LDL, and HDL cholesterol that are also independent of saturated fat intake.
Human Biomarkers for Assessing Copper Deficiency Copper is an essential nutrient for humans and is cofactor in enzymes that participate in critical body functions. Insufficient copper can lead to hematological and neurological abnormalities that may be irreversible if left untreated. Copper deficiency is believed to be rare in the U.S. population because typical dietary intake is usually sufficient to meet requirements. More recent evidence suggests that specific populations may be susceptible to copper deficiency in cases where copper absorption in the gut is impaired following gastric surgery or in individuals with high intakes of zinc. Preliminary studies by us and others have identified significant levels of moderate and severe symptomatic copper deficiency in patients who have undergone weight loss (bariatric) gastric bypass surgery. Copper deficiency in humans is difficult to recognize and treat because current diagnostic tools rely on measures of plasma concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin, which are neither sensitive nor specific for copper deficiency, and early warning blood markers (biomarkers) have not been identified. Recent developments indicate that copper chaperone molecules and cuproenzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and superoxide dismutase may be more sensitive to changes in copper status, but there has been very little work done in humans. The studies outlined here are aimed at assessing copper status using these biomarkers in gastric bypass surgery patients who are at risk for symptomatic copper deficiency. In addition, patients identified to be deficient will be supplemented with copper and this treatment will be evaluated using biomarker concentrations. The findings of these studies should provide insight into the effectiveness of novel biomarkers to identify those at risk and to guide appropriate treatment to prevent serious and permanent morbidity due to copper deficiency.
Rituximab in Treating Patients With Peripheral Neuropathy Caused by Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance This study was done to find out if the investigational medication, rituximab, could help relieve the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (such as numbness \[abnormal protein in the blood\] and weakness of the lower and upper extremities) in people who have monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and people with a symptomatic or smoldering Waldestrom macroglobulinemia.  Rituximab is an antibody which attacks a particular type of white blood cell (B Cell). By targeting the B-cells which make the abnormal protein which is involved in causing the nerve trouble, it is hoped that damage to nerve fibers will be stopped and improvement will be allowed to proceed.

The three exercise arms (isocaloric) are composed as follows:  Endurance training (n=15): 31min at 65-75% HRmax; HIT (n=15): 4x4min intervals at 85-95% HRmax divided by 3x3min of active recovery at 60-70% HRmax, making it a total of 25min; Pyramids (n=15): One Pyramid consists of 8 one-minute blocks. Those are grouped starting with one block of 70-75% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and another one at 80-85% HRmax. The top of the pyramid are 2 blocks of 85-90% HRmax. Intensity is lowered afterwards with one block at 80-85% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and last one at 70-75% HRmax. Two more pyramids follow, each divided by 2min of active recovery at 65-70% HRmax, making it a total of 28min.  All protocols are initiated by 5min of warm-up and end with 5min of cool-down, both at 60-70% HRpeak.  Primary Outcome: Individual maximum power output in watt (Pmax). Secondary Outcome: Change of power output in watt at lactate thresholds at 2 and 4 mmol/l.

Adjunctive Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for Lower Extermity Diabetic Ulcer: Diabetic foot ulcers are associated with high risk of amputation. About 50% of patients undergoing non-traumatic lower limb amputations are diabetics5. The 5-year amputation rate is estimated to be 19% with a mean time to amputation 58 months since the onset of an diabetic foot ulcer6.Because infection and tissue hypoxia are the major contributing factors for non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) carries a potential benefit for treating these problematic wounds that do not respond to standard therapy.  The role of oxygen in the wound healing cascade and subsequent combatting action against bacterial invasion, especially anaerobes, is well documented.14 Delayed or arrested healing and the development of infection is a direct result from decreased perfusion and poor oxygenation of tissue.15 The presence of wound hypoxia is an major etiological pathway in the development of chronic non-healing diabetic foot ulcers

Drug Interaction Study Between Linezolid and Clarithromycin in Tuberculosis Patients Future patients might benefit from a combination of linezolid (LIN) and clarithromycin (CLA) in the treatment of Multidrug-resistant and Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) due to possible synergistic activity as shown in in vitro experiments in different Mycobacteria strains. The investigators observed increased LIN serum levels in three cases after combining LIN and CLA of which the investigators described one in a case report (Bolhuis et al). The investigators suggest to conduct a prospective pharmacokinetic study in MDR- and XDR-TB patients to quantify the above described interaction between LIN and CLA.
Effect of Ondansetron on Spinal-induced Hypotension for Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the surgical standard for treating large or complex renal stones. The stones are removed by passing a small telescope through the side of the patient directly into the kidney, so the stone can be broken up and the fragments are removed .PCNL can be performed under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia. SA has some advantage over GA, such as lower postoperative pain, lower consumption of analgesic drugs and avoidance of side effects from multiple medications used in GA.However, SA induced sympathetic block leads to a decrease in the systemic vascular resistance and subsequent drop in the arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, anesthesia for PCNL usually requires a high sensory level reaching T4,resulting in a high incidence (nearly 33%) of hypotension. Also, to meet the long duration of surgery, drugs, ;like dexmedetomidine, are added to intrathecal local anesthetics , increasing the incidence of hemodynamic instability induced by the spinal anesthesia.  Decreasing the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the venous return to the heart result in a reflex vasodilation, bradycardia and hypotension. This reflex is called Bezold -Jarisch reflex and is mediated by serotonin receptors (5_HT3) located on the vagus nerve and within the wall of the cardiac ventricles.  Ondansetron; an antiemetic drug used for treatment of perioperative nausea and vomiting, was investigated as a 5HT antagonist for inhibition of Bezold - Jarisch reflex. While some studies proved its efficacy in prevention of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension , other studies could not support this conclusion .
Impact of Vitamin C on Pain Relief After an Emergency Department Visit for Acute Musculoskeletal Pain Recent evidence has shown that vitamin C has some analgesic properties and can therefore reduce opioids used during healing. Vitamin C analgesic effect has been explored mostly during the short-term postoperative context or in disease specific chronic pain prevention but not after acute musculoskeletal injuries, which are often seen in the emergency department (ED).  The study's primary aim is to compare the total morphine 5 mg equivalent pills consumed during a two-week follow-up between patients receiving vitamin C or a placebo after ED discharge for an acute musculoskeletal pain complaint.  The investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with 464 participants distributed in two arms, one group receiving 1 000 mg of vitamin C twice a day for 14 days and another one receiving a placebo. Participants will be ≥18 years of age, treated in ED for acute musculoskeletal pain present for less than 2 weeks, and discharged with an opioid prescription for home pain management. Total morphine 5 mg equivalent pills consumed during the two-week follow-up will be assessed via an electronic (or paper) diary. In addition, patients will report their daily pain intensity, pain relief, side effects, and other types of pain medication or other non-pharmacological approach (ice, heat, immobilization, etc.) used. Three months after the injury, participants will also be contacted to evaluate chronic pain development. The investigators hypothesized that vitamin C, compared to a placebo, will reduce opioid consumption during a 14-day follow-up for ED discharged patients treated for acute pain.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Autism Using a new and more detailed approach to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) recently developed in our lab, the investigators hope to learn more about irregularities in the brain that are related to autism. The investigators are especially interested in brain regions that contribute to repetitive behaviors in children with autism. Repetitive behaviors include stereotyped motor movements (hand-flapping), self-injurious behaviors (head hitting), compulsions (lining up toys), insistence on things staying the same, and difficulty with change. These behaviors often interfere with learning, can disrupt daily functioning, and can lead to other behavioral problems. Two specific aims will be accomplished:  Aim 1: To examine the integrity of white matter pathways in high functioning autistic children. The investigators hypothesize that autism is associated with specific white matter abnormalities in the cerebellum and other motor circuits. Additionally, the investigators expect to confirm and expand on previous reports of cerebral abnormalities by using newly developed DTI methods.  Aim 2: To determine whether there is a relationship between white matter abnormalities and the occurrence of restricted repetitive behaviors in children with autism. The investigators hypothesize that differences in the occurrence and type of restricted repetitive behaviors between autistic individuals are correlated with specific regional white matter abnormalities.  Results from the proposed experiments should contribute to current knowledge of brain abnormalities in autism and their relationship to restricted repetitive behaviors, and may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms underlying motor deficits in this disorder.

Effects of Two Anti-HIV Drug Combinations on the Immune Systems of HIV-Infected Patients Who Have Never Received Anti-HIV Drugs This study will compare an anti-HIV drug combination of protease inhibitor plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) to one that includes three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus an NNRTI. NNRTIs, NRTIs, and protease inhibitors are all types of anti-HIV drugs that block the virus in some way.  This study will try to find out if a treatment regimen containing a protease inhibitor plus an NNRTI has a different effect on the rise of CD4 cells compared to a treatment made up of three NRTIs plus an NNRTI. CD4 cells are cells of the immune system that fight infection. This study will also try to see if the combination of drugs used in this study is safe to use in HIV-positive patients.
Radiation Field, Dose and Fractionation Related to Mandibular Complications Radiotherapy is inhibiting the healing capacity of the mandibular bone. Late complications as bone exposure, fracture of the jaw, osteoradionecrosis might be a consequence of this vulnerability. A factor that could be involved in the development of complications is field of radiation. There are limited number of studies investigating this relation.  Retrospective analysis of a head and neck oncology register with prospectively included patients will be performed. Patients will be related to the University hospitals in Lund, Umea, Orebro, Stockholm. A thorough analysis of the medical journals in this group of patients will be performed. Included patients have been treated with combination of surgery and radiotherapy to treat malignancies in the head and neck region. At least 12 months follow up period is needed for inclusion.  The scientific aim is to investigate weather the field of radiation and fractionation is crucial for developing the formentioned complications.
D-serine Adjuvant Treatment for Parkinson's Disease The proposed experiment will evaluate the effects of the NMDA receptor full agonist D-serine (\~2g/day) on persistent symptoms of Parkinson's Disease and on antiparkinsonian drugs-induced dyskinesias.  D-serine will be used as add-on therapy to on-going medications received by Parkinson's Disease patients. The rational for this study stems from observations made in pervious clinical trials with schizophrenia patients, in which it was demonstrated that D-serine adjuvant treatment resulted in:1)improvement of parkinsonian side effects induced by antipsychotic drugs and 2) improvement of depression and negative (i.e apathy, blunted effects, anhedonia) symptoms which are similar to symptoms encountered in Parkinson's Disease.  The study will have a crossover design in accordance to which each patient will receive, in random order D-serine and placebo for a 6 weeks period each. Thus, any participant will have the opportunity to receive the experimental treatment.

AKY15-HK-301_NEPA Study Nausea and vomiting (feeling sick to your stomach and throwing up) are two of the most common unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy agents (drugs specifically used to treat cancer) that will be used for cancer treatment. If nausea and vomiting are not controlled, they could lead to dehydration, poor nutrition and a longer time in the hospital. Nausea and vomiting usually occur in response to conditions that affect the gut and the vomiting center, which is an area in the brain.  Netupitant and palonosetron are drugs that are thought to block the activation of certain types of chemicals in these areas (brain and gut) and, therefore, to prevent or reduce the severity of nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy is classified into two patterns based on the time of onset or start. Acute nausea and vomiting start within 24 hours of chemotherapy administration. Delayed nausea and vomiting starts approximately 2-5 days after chemotherapy administration. Regardless of when the nausea and vomiting start, these symptoms are usually treated with not just one drug, but a combination of drugs. In this study you will receive the study drug, which is a fixed combination of netupitant and palonosetron.  This is an open label single arm study. The main purpose of this study or clinical trial is to learn more about the effect (how well it works) of the fixed combination of netupitant and palonosetron (NEPA) in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in Hong Kong oncology patients receiving (neo)-adjuvant chemotherapy treatment consists of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer.

Breast-Conserving Surgery Followed by Radiation Therapy With MRI-Detected Stage I or Stage II Breast Cancer RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.  PURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage II breast cancer.
Transfusion in Sickle Cell Disease: Risk Factors for Alloimmunization Sickle cell patients have a high prevalence of alloimmunization. This high rate of alloimmunization can be partially explained by the existence of an antigenic difference between the predominantly Caucasian donor population and the sickle cell patients of African origin. Genetic and environmental risk factors have also been described.  The main risk factors that have been shown in retrospective or cross-sectional studies are some HLA alleles, the age of the patient, the number of leukocyte-depleted erythrocyte concentrates (CED) transfused, the number of transfusion episodes, the age of the CEDs, the existence of an inflammatory event at the time of transfusion and the presence of anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies.There is also evidence of an impaired TH response but the underlying immunological mechanism is not fully understood.  The aim of this study is to study the prevalence and the risk factors for anti-erythrocyte alloimmunization and to try to understand the immunological mechanisms.

Evaluation of a Strategy for the Presentation of Oral Nutritional Supplements in Verrines for Managing Undernutrition in the Elderly Undergoing Follow-up Care and Geriatric Rehabilitation Protein-energy malnutrition results from an imbalance between the body's intake and needs. Among the elderly in long-term care, the prevalence of undernutrition varies from 30% to 70%. It is responsible for or aggravates a state of fragility or dependence, and promotes the occurrence of morbidities. It is also associated with worsening prognosis for underlying diseases and increases the risk of death. Nutritional management of undernutrition is an issue, especially in health facilities. Among the various existing nutritional care methods, oral nutritional supplements should be considered in the event of failure of food enrichment measures or even at the outset in undernourished elderly people. However, compliance or acceptance of these products among the elderly remains limited and variable with consumption of oral nutritional supplements ranging between 48% and 94% according to studies, and, because of their ease of prescription, oral supplements are sometimes the only nutritional intervention.

Tear Osmolarity Changes in Habitual Contact Lens Wearers Tear osmolarity refers to the amount of osmotically active particles in tears and has been reported as one of the best diagnostic test for dry eye disease. Our research focused on following changes in tear osmolarity and ocular symptoms in the time-course of one year after refitting habitual contact lens wearers or fitting novices with modern daily disposable soft contact lenses. Fifty-six contact lens wearers aged (mean ± standards deviation) 26 ± 4 y/o were refitted with Silicone-Hydrogel (Delefilcon A) or Hydrogel (Omafilcon A) lenses.  Study included seven visits: baseline measurement before the study, two visits for contact lens fit and control and follow-up measurements after three, six, and 12 months of contact lens wear followed by measurements on bare eye according to the baseline scheme (post-study visit).  An impedance-based osmometer was used to collect samples from the lower tear meniscus. A standard Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire was used to monitor subject-reported ocular symptoms. Statistically significant differences were noted in tear osmolarity in the time course of the study for both eyes.  An improvement in tear osmolarity was most prevalent among subjects with high initial tear osmolarity. Low osmolarity levels were maintained after the study.  The findings of this prospective study will reveal that habitual contact lens wearers or novices may benefit from refitting with modern daily disposable soft contact lenses.

A Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial of Exercise Training in Pulmonary Hypertension in European Countries Chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with impaired exercise capacity, quality of life and right ventricular function. The disease is characterized by an increase of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right heart insufficiency.  Despite optimized combination-medical therapy most patients remain symptomatic, have reduced exercise capacity, quality of life and reduced survival rates, with an annual mortality rate of approximately 5 -15 % or even higher.  Previous training studies have suggested that exercise training as add-on to medical treatment is highly effective improving exercise capacity, quality of life and symptoms.  The current guidelines recommend exercise training only in specialized centres including both PH and rehabilitation specialists who are experienced in exercise training of severely compromised patients.  A specialized PH-training program has been performed in Heidelberg since 2003 including \>1200 patients with various forms of chronic PH. The exercise training program is performed in a special setting with an in-hospital start of the rehabilitation program. It is characterized by a low-dose closely supervised exercise training in small groups with additional psychological support and mental training.  This training program for patients with PH will be implemented in European centers to add exercise training to the existing PH therapies. The effect of the training on physical exercise capacity will be assessed by 6-minute walking distance (6-MWD). Further clinical parameters will be assessed to evaluate the effect on exercise capacity, quality of life and symptoms.  The aim of this study is to guide European PH-centers to become specialized centers for training in PH.  126 patients will be included, who either receive exercise training or continue their daily sedentary life style (1:1 randomization) for 15 weeks.  As inpatient settings are not available in all healthcare systems the training program will be adapted from the specific training program for PH patients developed in Heidelberg to a procedure, which is feasible in the local participating centres. Another objective of this study is to assess if the particular adopted training program specified for each participating centre and country is still safe and effective.

Inhalation of Sevoflurane Versus Intravenous Midazolam,Ketamine,Propofol For Pediatrics Undergoing Upper GI Endoscopy In the field of pediatric gastroenterology, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has established itself as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. In order to increase patient tolerance during this procedure, deep sedation is essential. Children are at a higher risk of serious adverse effects from procedural sedation; thus, their safety is a primary issue throughout this procedure. Multiple studies have been done to find the ideal method for procedural sedation in terms of ease of administration, quality, safety of sedation and recovery profile, but the consensus seems lacking. In this study we will compare between nasal inhalation of sevoflurane versus intravenous ketamine, midazolam and propofol for pediatrics undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

The secondary objective of the study is to compare the safety and tolerability, and the pharmacodynamic parameters of the new formulation with those of the reference formulation.
Abdominal Massage to Prevent Postoperative Ileus After Colorectal Surgery Post operative ileus refers to an disrupt in normal gastrointestinal motility responsible of nausea and vomiting. It occurs in about 15-20% of colorectal surgeries. Some preventive measures have been included in the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Program such as early mobilisation and enteral feeding or minimal invasive approach.  Abdominal massage is not widely applied amongst general surgery team and is not part of the recommendation. This technique refers to profound manœuvrers of visceras through abdominal palpation and breathing, and has been used as part of the local protocol of Grenoble Alps University Hospital for many years with satisfactory results. No complications have been reported.  Various studies have evaluated the value of physiotherapy and massage for resumption of normal bowel function. A study from Rouen University Hospital demonstrated that a mechanical stress to the cuteaneous tissue by LPG Cellu M50® machine would reduce pain and lower the time to first flatus. Similar results were obtained after Cardiac surgery. In a preclinical study on operated rats, abdominal massage also improved normal bowel function recovery.  Physiotherapist plays a key role in RAC. Their action on respiratory function (movement of diaphragm) and musculoskeletal system (early walking) allows a faster recovery and a reduction of time of hospitalization. Even though the results on time to first flatus and anxiety seem interesting, Deep abdominal massage has never been evaluated.

Donor Stem Cell Transplantation for Congenital Immunodeficiencies This study uses transplantation to treat patients with problems in their immune system. The immune system cells come from the bone marrow where they grow from special cells called stem cells. Giving patients stem cells from someone else may help to cure many patients with certain immune diseases. This is called 'bone marrow transplantation'. This procedure can have side effects that are life-threatening. To try to make transplantation safer we are using lower doses of the medications used in preparing the patient for the transplant.  'Conditioning' treatments are given to patients to create space in their bone marrow. This lets the cells of the donor go into the bone marrow and produce normal immune cells. This study will use lower doses of a drug called busulfan and lower doses of radiation than what are currently being used in other kinds of bone marrow transplantation for other diseases.  Another problem that can occur with bone marrow transplantation is 'graft-versus-host disease'. This happens when the cells of the donor attacks different parts of the patient s body. This study will use a medicine called sirolimus instead of the usual medicine, cyclosporine, to prevent graft-versus-host disease.  To go onto this study, you must have:  1. A severe immune deficiency, such as chronic granulomatous disease or leukocyte adhesion deficiency. 2. Have problems from the disease that call for stem cell transplantation. 3. You must also be between the ages of 2 and 40 years.  Two groups of patients are included in this study:  1. Patients who have a brother or sister that have stem cells that match the patient. This is known as an allogeneic matched sibling transplant. 2. Patients who do not have a matched sibling donor but have a donor that matches in the National Marrow Donor Program. This is know as matched unrelated donor transplantation.  Patients will have the following procedures:  * To create space in the bone marrow, patients are given two drugs, Campath-1H and busulfan. To prevent the body from getting rid of the donated cells, patients are given sirolimus. On the day before the BMT, patients in the matched unrelated donor group also receive a low-dose of whole-body radiation. This will further improve the chances that the patients body will accept the donor cells. * Patients will get the donor stem cells through an intravenous (IV) line that goes into a vein in their body. The cells make their way to the bone marrow space and slowly refill the marrow over the next several weeks. Patients will usually stay in the hospital for 30 days after the transplant. * For the first 3 months after the transplant, patients are watched closely. The patients will have frequent visits to the clinic. During these visits the patient will have a physical examination and blood tests. The doctor and nurse will also check any symptoms the patient may have. At day 100 after the transplant a sample of bone marrow is taken. * Patients will continue to be followed periodically for at least 5 years after the transplant.
Assessment of the Different Etiological and Susceptibility Markers in Patients With Pancreatitis: Investigating IG4, Cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie- Virus, Genetic Polymorphism of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a multifactorial disease. AP represents a significant number of hospital admissions. Most of the patients are admitted in an acute setting. Early identification of its etiology is an essential step toward the rational approach, both for its implications in the immediate therapy and the prevention of recurrence. Although often obvious, the etiological workup of acute pancreatitis can be challenging.

Intravesical Chemotherapy Treatment of Superficial Bladder Cancer This is a phase II study where chemotherapy (gemcitabine) is given into the urinary bladder.
Phase 1 Trial With SIR-Spheres and Cetuximab +/- Erlotinib The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the combination of selective internal radiation (SIR)-Spheres with yttrium-90 attached and cetuximab. Some participants will also take erlotinib with this combination.  Yttrium-90 microspheres are designed to treat cancer that has spread to the liver. SIR-Spheres are designed to deliver the radiation directly to the liver. This radiation may cause the tumor cells to die.  Cetuximab and erlotinib are drugs that are designed to block the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a protein that helps cancer cells grow. Blocking the EGFR may stop tumors from growing.
Phase II Multicenter Study of Talimogene Laherparepvec in Classic or Endemic Kaposi Sarcoma Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) promoted by immunosuppression. HIV-related KS and iatrogenic posttransplantation KS are treated by immune restoration, in association with local or systemic therapies as chemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and endemic KS, the underlying relative immunosuppression cannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified, mostly based on surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS. Most aggressive forms with visceral involvement are treated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give at best 30-60% of transient responses and may not be well tolerated in elderly patients.  Talimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic immunotherapy approved by the FDA, in metastatic or unresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or cutaneous lesions. It is designed to induce tumor regression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects, and of uninjected lesions through induction of systemic antitumor immunity.  In Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced tumor, treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors have proven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that immunotherapy could be effective in virus-induced tumors. Two cases of metastatic MCC successfully treated with talimogene laherparepvec were recently reported, suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an effective therapeutic option. Considering the high immunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of the immune evasion in the development of KS, and the cutaneous manifestations (\>90% of patients) that can be easily injected, classic and endemic KS is a good tumor model to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec. The main objective is to assess whether talimogene laherparepvec is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0\<10%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1\>40%) in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma.
Examining the Efficacy of tDCS in the Attenuation of Epileptic Paroxysmal Discharges and Clinical Seizures The current study examined the feasibility of High-Definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) in reducing epileptiform activity in a 30-month-old child suffering from early onset epileptic encephalopathy. HD-tDCS was administered over 10 intervention days spanning two weeks including pre- and post-intervention video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring.

The Duration of the Suppressive Effects of Desloratadine on Allergen Prick Tests After Discontinuation (P04441) This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single center study in subjects with positive histamine skin prick test and a positive RadioAllergoSorbent Test (RAST) (class \> 2) to one of the tested standardized allergenic extracts: tree pollen, cat dander, house dust mite, or a mixture of five grass pollens. Subjects will be randomized to desloratadine 5 mg once daily, levocetirizine 5mg once daily, or placebo once daily for 8 days of treatment followed by 11 days of skin testing after discontinuation of the antihistamine treatment phase. The duration of the suppressive effects of desloratadine on cutaneous allergen-induced wheal and flare responses after discontinuation of a one-week treatment will be established.
Lactoferrin Versus Ferrous Sulfate in Iron-deficiency During Pregnancy The main drawbacks with oral iron are side-effects, poor compliance, and limited absorption from the gut. It has become very apparent gastrointestinal intolerance with oral iron therapy is dose related and common (up to 20% of patients), and this frequently leads to poor compliance.  Lactoferrin (formerly known as lactotransferrin) is a glycoprotein, and a member of a transferrin family, thus belonging to those proteins capable of binding and transferring iron. It represents an attractive and promising alternative to ferrous sulphate oral administration as pregnant women receiving lactoferrin did not experience any adverse effects.  This study aims to compare between lactoferrin and ferrous sulphate for therapy of iron deficiency in pregnant women.
Predictors of Speech Ability in Down Syndrome Speech is a critical aspect of the human experience and usually develops in a "seemingly automatic process that continues from birth through adolescence and underlies many related abilities" (e.g., language and reading, see National Academy of Medicine Report on Speech and Language Disorders, 2016). Many individuals with Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21, DS) struggle to communicate and participate more fully in human communication and educational learning experiences because their speech is difficult to understand. The purpose of the proposed project is to measure speech-articulation accuracy and speech intelligibility, and their proposed primary predictors at study entry in 20 children with DS age 6;0 to 13;11). A validated treatment, speech recast intervention (see Yoder, Camarata \& Woynaroski, 2016) will be used to drive growth in speech intelligibility as a means of evaluating changes in potential sequelae of change. This integrated study will include measures of speech-articulation accuracy, speech-prosody, general cognitive ability, receptive vocabulary skills, and clinical assay of oral-motor ability as potential predictors of speech intelligibility growth in DS. The Investigators will also be measuring suprasegmental and rhythmic factors associated with growth.
Albendazole Dose Finding and Pharmacokinetics in Children and Adults This study is a single-blind randomized clinical trial conducted in rural Côte d'Ivoire. This study aims at providing evidence on the dose-response of increasing oral albendazole dosages against whipworm (T. trichiura) and hookworm infections in preschoolers (2-5 years), school-aged children (6-12 years) and adults (≥ 21 years).  The primary objective is to determine cure rates (primary end point, i.e. conversion from being egg positive pre-treatment to egg negative post-treatment). Secondary objectives involve the determination of egg reduction rates (the reduction in the number of excreted eggs from baseline (prior to treatment) to follow-up) and the assessment of safety of ascending dosages of albendazole (secondary end points). In addition, key pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from blood samples collected with a micro-sampling device (secondary end point).
Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia The purpose of this study is to determine if the intervention of a 510(k)-cleared endoscopically-guided (Halo Ablation systems), ablation system plus anti-secretory therapy is better than anti-secretory therapy alone in clearing Barrett's Esophagus.

Idarubicin and Cytarabine With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Giving idarubicin and cytarabine with bevacizumab may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet know whether giving idarubicin together with cytarabine is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating acute myeloid leukemia. This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving idarubicin and cytarabine together with bevacizumab works compared to idarubicin and cytarabine alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia
Metformin for Antipsychotic-induced Weight Gain in Adults With Intellectual Disability People with IDD (intellectual and developmental disability) have very high rates of obesity and die prematurely from cardiometabolic disease. While antipsychotics contribute to this problem, their use is necessary and appropriate in a significant subgroup of individuals with IDD. Exercise and diet interventions have limitations and may not be sufficient, requiring effective adjunctive pharmacological approaches to target obesity and related comorbidities in IDD. However, persons with IDD treated with antipsychotics are systematically excluded from clinical trials hindering development of evidence to help guide safe and effective treatment of these comorbidities. Moreover, evidence from other disorders cannot be extrapolated to IDD given inherent biological differences between disorders. This trial will address the identified gaps, which extend beyond cardiovascular morbidity and negatively impact psychosocial outcomes, in a hugely underserviced population.This is the the first RCT (randomized control trial) to examine the efficacy of metformin in overweight or obese adults with IDD who have experienced antipsychotic-induced weight gain. By generating efficacy data for a very accessible and scalable intervention, allows for guideline and implementation strategies to address a recalcitrant health problem.

Usefulness of Exhaled Breath Condensate for Evaluation of Markers of Airway Inflammation in Children With Asthma Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has emerged as a novel noninvasive technique for assessment of airway inflammation, and it provides information on airway lining fluid composition. Traditionally, such assessment relies on invasive diagnostic tools such as bronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to obtain specimens from the airway but it is very uncomfortable procedure especially for young patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of allergic disease, disease monitoring and exposure to tobacco smoke on airway inflammation measured by markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in children with asthma allergic to house dust mite. Also, we aim to assess correlations between cytokine concentrations in EBC and clinical characteristic of the patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as another phenotype of asthma.

Flow-cycled Ventilation in Preterm Infants This short pilot study is to assess the tolerance of preterm infants, born below 32 weeks gestation with respiratory distress syndrome, to flow-cycle ventilation, and see if infants require less overall pressure from the ventilator than the usual conventional settings used, with the aim of providing data to construct a larger trial looking at the longer term outcome of these infants using this type of ventilation in the future.  Many preterm infants at these gestations require assistance from a ventilator due to the immaturity of their lungs. The lungs of preterm infants are susceptible to damage, especially if high pressures are needed or prolonged periods of ventilation. There is concern that if the infant's breathing pattern does not synchronise with the ventilator, this causes additional distress, longer duration of ventilation needed and increased risk of complications. Over the past 20 years, a different type of ventilation, known as flow-cycle ventilation, has been trialed, with limited use in preterm infants. This allows the baby to determine the duration of breathing in and out and how many breaths they require per minute. This would help babies to synchronise better with the ventilator, and consequently require less pressure from the ventilator.  This pilot study is being conducted at St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester. All babies born under 32 weeks gestation, with a stable respiratory effort, will be eligible for consideration for the study. The study will last no longer than 5 hours and involve the babies receiving different pressures from the ventilator in flow-cycle mode for 1-hour epochs. Blood gases after each epoch and continuous ventilator data will be downloaded to assess their tolerance on the different settings, before being returned to the usual conventional settings used on the unit. The babies will have continuous monitoring throughout as per standard neonatal intensive care.

These patients will complete all requirements by ICARE protocol and in addition will be tested for endothelial function by a non-invasive method of flow mediated dilatation (FMD).
The Effect of Placental Cord Drainage on Postpartum Blood Loss To determine if placental cord drainage decreases the blood loss after spontaneous vaginal delivery
Virtual Body Project Groups Led by Peers Versus Clinicians Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of illnesses associated with significant psychological and physiological consequences. Overall, only 20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment and treatment is effective for only about 25-35% for those who receive care. The development and implementation of effective prevention approaches for those at risk is therefore pivotal. The Body Project is the most effective ED prevention program for at-risk females according to meta-analyses, but reach has been limited since delivery has traditionally been in-person. Further research is warranted to examine cost-effective and easily accessible approaches to increase scalability and potential for broad implementation. With this application, the investigators therefore propose to examine the effectiveness of the Body Project in young females, a high-risk group, with the following main novel aspects: i) virtually-delivered Body Project groups to maximize reach; ii) peer-led versus clinician-led virtually-delivered Body Project groups; iii) the inclusion of objective measures to assess engagement of intervention targets (i.e., mediator).

The Effects of Empagliflozin on Arterial Wall Characteristics Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by impaired arterial function and high incidence of cardiovascular events. Metformin and most recent antidiabetic groups of drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors, were in previous studies shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Until now, direct effect of empagliflozin on arterial function and its comparison to metformin was not studied yet.  Aim: The aim of the present study is to explore and compare potential direct effects of empagliflozin and metformin on arterial functional and structural arterial wall characteristics in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Methods: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are randomized into four groups: 1) empagliflozin (25 mg daily), 2) metformin (2000 mg daily), 3) combination (empagliflozin 25 mg daily and metformin 2000 mg daily) and 4) control (placebo). At inclusion and after 12 weeks treatment, arterial function is assessed: endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), reactive hyperemia index (RHI)) and arterial stiffness (carotid pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV) and common carotid artery stiffness (β-stiffness)).

Colonoscopy and FIT as Colorectal Cancer Screening Test in the Average Risk Population Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of death in Sweden. There are approximately 6000 new cases each year in Sweden and the disease specific mortality is more than 40%. There risk is about 1% to develop CRC between 60-70 years of age making 60-year olds a suitable target population for colorectal cancer screening.  The Swedish ministry of health and social affairs proposed a national study on the efficiency of colorectal cancer screening in the Swedish population regarding mortality, but also what screening method to be used. Eighteen participating counties of Sweden now fund the study to be launched in 2014.  From the Register of the total population individuals 59-62 years of age will be randomized and invited by mail to screening. Thirty- thousand five hundred individuals will be invited to primary colonoscopy and 60 000 individuals will be invited to high sensitive FIT (approximately 10% positive) and if positive to a subsequent follow-up colonoscopy. If test negative a second round of FIT will be asked for in two years. In total 183 000 randomized individuals will not be invited to screening, but followed in the Swedish Cancer register and serve as controls. The inclusion period I set to five years (five years with the second round of FIT) generating approximately 5 000 colonoscopies yearly the first three years and 1200 year four and five at a compliance rate of 35% in the colonoscopy arm and 50% in the FIT arm.  Follow-up time is set to 15 years with the primary endpoint disease specific mortality, but also incidence. Secondary outcomes by others to be studied are in short quality assurance variables of colonoscopy, participants and non-participants experiences of the invitation and the screening procedure, health economy measures of the CRC-screening study and when implemented in clinical care.
Addressing Attitudes to Improve Use of Protective Headwear in Older Adults The goal of this phase of the project is to identify the elements of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) that should be targeted to provide the most influence on older adults' behavior (or other stakeholders) to purchase and wear protective headwear. The investigators also intend to determine the format of communication (social marketing/academic detailing) that is most influential for different key stakeholder groups. The TPB has been useful in understanding behavior change related to exercise and adaptive equipment use (such as grab bars, canes, hip protectors); in understanding how a person's attitudes, subjective/social norms and perceived behavioral control inform the development of intention that leads to behavior change.

Comparison of Palonosetron and Ramosetron for Preventing Patient-controlled Analgesia Related Nausea and Vomiting Following Spine Surgery; Association With ABCB1 Polymorphism Opioid-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) offers excellent pain control, however, its use inevitably increases the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Ramosetron and palonosetron are commonly used 5-HT3 antagonists for the prevention and treatment of PONV. It is not clear which one has superior antiemetic efficacy for the prevention of PONV in patients using opioid-based IV-PCA. The antiemetic efficacy of 5HT3 antagonists may be influenced by polymorphism of ABCB1, a drug-transporter gene. This study evaluates relative antiemetic efficacy of ramosetron and palonosetron in patients using IV-PCA after spinal surgery and impact of ABCB1 polymorphism on the antiemetic efficacy of the ramosetron and palonosetron. The incidence and intensity of PONV during postoperative 48 h will be assessed. ABCB1 polymorphisms 3435C\>T and 2677G\>T/A will be evaluated in all patients.

Measuring the Impact of an Interdisciplinary Polypharmacy Clinic Within a Patient-centered Medical Home Title: Measuring the impact of an interdisciplinary polypharmacy clinic within a patient-centered medical home  Objectives:  The primary objective of this project will be to track the types of interventions made in an interdisciplinary polypharmacy clinic to improve medication regimens and medication burden. Polypharmacy has been well documented in the literature as a risk for medication errors, adverse drug events, and morbidity. Team visits, including complete medication reviews, by pharmacists and physicians within a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) tier 3 patient-centered medical home (PCMH) at an academic medical center, can improve medication regimens. Secondary objectives include (1) measuring each patient's quality of life at baseline and one month post-intervention and (2) tracking the cost of medication additions and discontinuations.  Methods:  Patients taking ten or more chronic medications will be identified for referral to the polypharmacy clinic from a report generated from the electronic medical record. The polypharmacy clinic will be staffed by a pharmacist and medical resident with oversight from an attending physician who specializes in geriatrics. Drug-related problems identified during the visit will be resolved and categorized based upon indication, efficacy, cost, safety, and compliance. The numbers and types of interventions made, both during the primary visit and anticipated in the future, will be tracked. The 12-item short form (SF-12) survey will also be administered at baseline and one month post intervention. The increase or decrease in cost for medications added and removed during these visits will be captured using the average wholesale prices.  Preliminary Results Using descriptive statistics, the types of drug-related problems identified and interventions made will be reported. Changes in quality of life and monthly medication costs will also be described.
COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients' Evolution After Medical Transport by Train From Paris Intensive Care Units to West of France Intensive Care Units Since early 2020, France knows a sanitary crisis with a massive influx of COVID-19 patients admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICU). It led to a saturation of the French health system, especially in some geographic areas such as East of France or Paris region. Therefore, authorities decided to transfer some critically ill patients from these crowded ICUs to less busy regional ICUs. it was done for the first time by medical train transportation. Knowing that the investigators lack experience regarding this type of medical evacuation, regarding the high number of transferred patients, with such a logistic effort, the investigators decided to study this phase of the COVID-19 sanitary crisis in order to draw a feedback. So far, there are no data in the literature regarding this topic.

Growth Hormone Use in Cystic Fibrosis - a Multicenter Study Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disorder in America. Previous studies by our group and others have shown that human recombinant growth hormone (GH) improves height velocity, weight velocity, lean body mass (LBM) and pulmonary function. These positive results have prompted us to ask further questions regarding GH use in CF including: a) Do patients with better baseline body weight and pulmonary function derive more benefit from treatment than those with worse weight and pulmonary function?, b) Does GH use improve the patient's quality of life?, c) Once GH is discontinued, are the positive effects sustained? We hypothesize that GH treatment in CF patients will improve their clinical status and their quality of life. We further hypothesize that these effects will be present regardless of baseline body weight or pulmonary function, and that positive outcome will be sustained for at least one year after GH treatment is discontinued. To test our hypothesis, we will recruit 40 prepubertal children from five CF centers across the United States (8 per center). Patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with GH (0.3mg/kg/wk) during either the first or the second year. All subjects will be seen every three months. We will evaluate the following parameters every three months: 1) height, height velocity and Z-score, 2) body weight and weight velocity. Every six months we will measure: 1) lean body mass utilizing DEXA, 2) pulmonary function, including measurement of respiratory muscle strength (peak inspiratory and peak expiratory pressure), 3) quality of life (QOL), quantitated from QOL forms specific for CF ("The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire"). After one year of study, subjects will "cross-over" to the other treatment arm. This 24 month study will allow us to statistically compare outcome measures in 20 treated and 20 nontreated subjects from multiple centers, and will allow us to assess sustained effect in the 20 subjects who receive GH during the first year, by comparing their results to results obtained during the year post treatment.
Treatment of Leukemia and Lymphoma in Children With Ataxia Telangiectasia Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem disease with diverse manifestations, including progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, respiratory disease, and genomic instability. One of the most important features of A-T is the increased predisposition to cancer, especially to lymphoid malignancies. Patients with A-T are generally excluded from collaborative clinical trials, their treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles have rarely been reported, and little is currently known concerning the treatment intensity required to provide a reasonable balance between efficacy and toxicity. The aims of this study are to build a large international de-identified database of children with A-T treated for leukemia and lymphoma, to investigate epidemiology and outcome of treatment, toxicity profiles and risk factors which impact outcome, in order to eventually enable the generation of data-based treatment recommendations for this population.
Evaluate the Effect of Exenatide Treatment on Coronary Artery Endothelial Function Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor of cardio-cerebral vascular disease such as coronary heart disease. GLP-1 is a kind of incretin secreted by the L-cell located in Ileum. It acts as an incretin hormone by protentiating glucose-stimulated insulin release. Recent studies reported that GLP-1 RA can protect the vascular endothelial and prevent vascular from atherosclerosis. Investigators design this study to investigate exenatide's effect on the improvement of the coronary endothelial function by evaluating endothelium dependent diastolic function and testing the vascular endothelial active substance and related inflammatory factors.

The genes we are studying are those which influence detoxification of drugs and toxins.
Epidermal Adhesive Sensors to Enhance Continuous Glucose Measurement in Patients With Diabetes: The EASE Study Self-testing of glucose by patients living with diabetes mellitus (DM) involves needles, which can cause discomfort or inconvenience; these and other factors can lead to decreased willingness to perform these checks that are vital to DM management. While technology has evolved, a needle-free glucose monitoring device is currently not available. The investigators are studying a glucose sensor that adheres to the skin, similarly to a temporary tattoo. This sensor can now obtain continuous readings. As it has not yet been tested in individuals with DM, this study will examine its accuracy and acceptability in these patients.

Study of Regorafenib as a 3rd-line or Beyond Treatment for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study of regorafenib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care for subjects with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with at least imatinib and sunitinib.  The study is composed of 3 periods: A Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Survival Follow up Period.  Subjects randomized to be treated with regorafenib will receive 160 mg po od for 3 weeks of every 4 week (28 day) cycle (ie, 3 weeks on/1 week off). In addition subjects will receive best supportive care which excludes any disease specific anti cancer therapy such as any kinase inhibitor, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.  Tumor assessment will be every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, every 6 weeks for the next 3 months (through month 6), and every 8 weeks until the end of treatment, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Tumor assessments include CT or MRI and will be performed until tumor progression is seen in a central radiology review.  Subjects receiving placebo who experience disease progression may be offered active treatment.  Subjects who experience progression during regorafenib treatment may continue open label treatment.  All subjects will enter the Survival Follow-up Period upon discontinuation of randomized study treatment.
Rehabilitative Trial With tDCS in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease, which is a group of neurological disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells that control voluntary muscles of the body. The disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Current drugs approved for ALS treatment only modestly slow disease progression.  Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique, which has been demonstrated to modulate cerebral excitability in several neurodegenerative disorders and modulate intracortical connectivity measures.  In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators will evaluate whether a two-weeks' treatment with bilateral motor cortex anodal tDCS and spinal cathodal tDCS can improve symptoms in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and modulate intracortical connectivity, at short and long term.

Rhythm Control - Catheter Ablation With or Without Anti-arrhythmic Drug Control of Maintaining Sinus Rhythm Versus Rate Control With Medical Therapy and/or Atrio-ventricular Junction Ablation and Pacemaker Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are two common heart conditions that are associated with an increase in death and suffering. When both of these two conditions occur in a patient the patient's prognosis is poor. These patients have poor life quality and are frequently admitted to the hospital. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients is extremely challenging. Two options for managing the atrial fibrillation are permitting the atrial fibrillation to continue but controlling the heart rate, or to convert the atrial fibrillation rhythm back to normal and try to maintain the heart in sinus rhythm. Until now, the method to keep the patient in normal sinus rhythm is with antiarrhythmic drugs. Studies using antiarrhythmic drugs to control the rhythm failed to show any survival benefit when compared with permitting the patient to be in atrial fibrillation. In the last few years, new development in techniques and technologies now enable catheter ablation (cauterization of tissue in the heart with a catheter) to be a successful treatment in abolishing atrial fibrillation and that this approach is better than antiarrhythmic drug to control the rhythm. However, there has not been any long-term study to determine whether catheter ablation to abolish atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients would reduce mortality or admissions for heart failure.  This study is to compare the effect of catheter ablation-based atrial fibrillation rhythm control to rate control in patients with heart failure and high burden atrial fibrillation on the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure events defined as an admission to a healthcare facility for \> 24 hours or clinically significant worsening heart failure leading to an intervention (defined as treatment in an emergency department, a same-day access clinic, or an infusion centre) or unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider for administration of an intravenous diuretic and an increase in chronic heart failure therapy. This study may have a dramatic impact on the way the investigators manage these patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure and may improve the outlook and well being of these patients.

This will be compared with the response after treatment with a dummy (placebo) and a tablet treatment for asthma called Singulair (montelukast). Subjects in the study will receive all 3 treatments in a random order. The study is double-blind so subjects will not know which treatment they are taking at any given time.
The Effect of Patient Position on the External Haller Index Value Among Patients With Pectus Excavatum Pectus excavatum is the most common anterior chest wall deformity, affecting up to 1:400 of newborns. The current gold standard to quantify the extent of deformity is by calculating the Haller Index based on a Computed Tomography (CT)-scan. However, as such scans inescapably imply exposure to ionizing radiation, novel imaging techniques have been investigated. Three-dimensional optical surface scanning is a promising new technique to acquire the trunks' three-dimensional (3D) surface topography. Based on this 3D scan, one is able to calculate the external Haller Index that is known to highly correlate with the conventional gold standard Haller Index that is based on internal measures. Both the conventional and external Haller Index are known to be affected by the respiratory phase in which the scan is acquired, however, what is the effect of patient position on the external Haller Index, and if affected, how should one correct for this phenomenon? To investigate this, a retrospective single-centre pilot study will be conducted.

Stroke Prophylaxis With Apixaban in Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Objective: To study the efficacy and safety of apixaban as stroke prophylaxis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 and atrial fibrillation (AF) with or without dialysis treatment. The study hypothesis is that compared to no anticoagulation, apixaban reduces the incidence of ischemic stroke without causing an unacceptable increase in fatal or intracranial bleeding events.  The secondary objectives are to evaluate the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, and major bleeding in people with CKD stage 5 and AF treated with apixaban compared to standard of care without anticoagulation.  Trial design: Pragmatic Prospective Open Label Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial, phase 3b over 12-72 months.  Trial population: 1000-1400 patients at ≈50 sites in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Poland Eligibility criteria: Adults ≥18 years with CKD stage 5 (ongoing treatment with any chronic dialysis treatment OR an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)\* \<20 ml/min/1.73 m2 at least twice 3 months apart of which at least one occasion is \<15 ml/min/1.73 m2 due to CKD during the last 12 months) and a diagnosis of chronic, paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF or atrial flutter (AFL) with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 for men or ≥3 or more for women as an indication for oral anticoagulation.  The exclusion criteria are AF or AFL due to reversible causes, rheumatic mitral stenosis or moderate-to-severe non-rheumatic mitral stenosis at the time of inclusion into the study, a condition other than AF or AFL that requires chronic anticoagulation, contraindications for anticoagulation, active bleeding or serious bleeding within 3 months, planned for surgery within 3 months, and current use of strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein.  Interventions: Randomization 1:1 to treatment with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily and standard of care, or standard of care and no anticoagulation.  Outcome measures: primary efficacy (time to first ischemic stroke); primary safety (the composite of time to first intracranial bleeding or fatal bleeding); secondary efficacy (time to all-cause mortality, time to cardiovascular event or cardiovascular death); secondary safety (time to first major bleeding according to International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria)

Modified Strategy to Safely Rule Out Pulmonary Embolism in the Emergency Department Because a missed PE could be potentially lethal, several researches reported that PE is both overinvestigated and overdiagnosed. The diagnostic gold standard for PE is the computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and has been shown to have clear risks and other downsides. To limit the use of CTPA, two rules were recently reported to be safe to exclude PE: the PERC rule and the YEARS rule. PERC is an 8 item block of clinical criteria that has recently been validated to safely exclude PE in low risk patients. YEARS is a clinical rule that allow to raise the threshold of D-dimer for the order of CTPA. However, whether a modified diagnostic algorithm that includes these two rules combined could safely reduce imaging study use in the ED is unknown.  This is a non-inferiority, cluster cross-over randomized, international trial.  Each center will be randomized on the sequence of period intervention: 4 months intervention (MOdified Diagnostic Strategy: MODS) followed by 4 months control (usual care), or 4 months control followed by 4 months intervention with 1 month of "wash-out" between the two periods.  All centers will recruit adult emergency patients with a suspicion of PE.  In the control group (usual strategy), patients will be tested for D-dimer, followed if positive by a CTPA.  In the intervention group (MODS) :  All included patients will be tested with quantitative D-dimer. The MODS work-up will be based on YEARS rule :  - If all YEARS criteria are absent, the threshold of D-Dimer for ordering a CTPA will be raised.  If at least one criterion of YEARS is present, then the D-dimer threshold for ordering a CTPA will be as usual.

Genasense® (Oblimersen Sodium), Fludarabine, and Rituximab in Subjects With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia The treatment combination of Rituxan® (rituximab) and fludarabine has previously been reported to produce a high percentage of responses with less toxicity than other combination treatments. However, some leukemia subjects continue to have leukemia despite treatment with these standard anticancer drug therapies, or they may work for only a short period of time. In some subjects, when the leukemia does not respond well to therapy the leukemia cells may be over-producing one or more proteins. One of these proteins is called Bcl-2. Bcl-2 is a protein that appears to protect cancer cells from being killed and thus lengthens the life of the cancer cells. Genasense® (oblimersen sodium) is a compound that blocks production of the Bcl-2 protein. By first lowering levels of Bcl-2, it is possible that chemotherapy drugs may work more effectively as a cancer treatment. Genasense® may also directly kill CLL cells. This study will test whether treating subjects with Genasense®, fludarabine and rituximab is safe and effective.
Potential Lead Exposure Through Eating Self-harvested Wild Game This is a clinical research protocol to determine the feasibility of assessing lead levels in hunters who use lead projectiles. This study will determine if it is possible to perform an interventional double-blind placebo-controlled study of lead levels in hunters using lead or lead-free projectiles following consumption of self-harvested wild game. The hypothesis for the subsequent study is that minute lead particles from shrapnel dispersed through the animal during harvest are ingested and result in increased lead serum levels. This current observational study establishes if this conclusive interventional study is possible through establishing if hunters using lead projectiles in New Zealand have elevated lead levels after eating animals harvested with lead projectiles. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice Standards, associated regulations and institutional research requirements.  This study aims to assess if hunters eating meat shot with lead projectiles experience elevated lead levels. Hunters will be asked to provide blood samples 2-4 days after they eat meat harvested with lead bullets and provide a subsequent sample when they have abstained from eating wild game harvested with lead bullets. We have chosen to use deer as the species for this study to reduce variation and New Zealand is the ideal place to conduct this study because of year-round hunting of deer. This design will allows paired testing of subject lead levels.

COVID-19 Vaccine Induced Immunity This study aims to address the following three objectives:  1. Longitudinal evaluation of the development of CMI responses in response to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine: T cells isolated from the blood of COVID-19 vaccine recipients will be evaluated for their functionality in response to vaccine antigens. The temporal and functional properties of CMI responses will be correlated with the humoral or antibody responsiveness. CMI responses will be measured in vaccine recipients prior to vaccination to determine whether the presence or functionality of pre-existing responses to common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) or previous SARS-CoV-2 infections affect the development of CMI responses to the COVID-19 vaccine. 2. Identification of cellular and soluble factors that influence vaccine responsiveness:     While it is known that poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients are strongly associated with markers of systemic inflammation, the influence these systemic markers will have on COVID-19 vaccine responsiveness is not clear. Using systems biology approaches, the investigators will perform comprehensive profiling of cellular immune subsets, inflammatory signatures to identify determinants influencing the development of CMI responses to vaccine. 3. Examine variability of immune and viral genes and their relationship to vaccine induced immune responses: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA), T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) proteins are highly genetically diverse and critical to development of protective immunity. The investigators will perform HLA sequencing on whole blood-derived DNA samples and TCR and BCR sequencing on sorted, SARS-CoV2 vaccine antigen-specific T cells and B cells, respectively, to assess how different sequence combinations impact the CMI responses to vaccine.
Lenvatinib Combined With TACE and Camrelizumab in Conversion Resection for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LEN-TAC Study) Compared with systemic therapy alone, conversion therapy is promising to improve the prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Triple therapy (lenvatinib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and camrelizumab) may have significant efficacy in conversion therapy in patients with advanced HCC, but its safety and efficacy are unknown. We designed a randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of lenvatinib combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and camrelizumab versus lenvatinib alone in conversion resection for advanced HCC. Totally 168 patients with BCLC C stage HCC will be rigorously screened and included, and the primary endpoints of the study are 2-year overall survival and conversion resection rate. This study will serve as a reference for new treatment strategies for advanced HCC.

Bakery Products for Non-Coeliac Gluten Sensitive Consumers The aim of the study is to produce a tolerable alternative to normal wheat bread which would be suitable for subjects with self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The bread would be made from wheat so, in contrast to gluten-free bread, would be more comparable to standard bread. To make this bread, the investigators will use advanced enzyme technology and/or novel formulations to target the digestion or removal of wheat proteins, which might be involved in the etiology of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, preferentially over other those that are more useful for baking quality. The investigators will determine palatability and tolerance of this new product in a human cross-over, randomised, blind and placebo-controlled intervention study.  It has been estimated 6-10% of the population are sensitive to gluten who do not have coeliac disease (CD). Three breads will be produced and tested in this study against a suitable reference based on standard wheat flour and baking process

Factors Influencing Patient Choice of Bladder Reconstruction Following Radical Cystectomy Radical cystectomy (bladder removal) after bladder cancer necessitates surgical reconstruction to allow urine drainage. Usually, this is achieved by either ileal conduit (a stoma leads to an external bag) or orthotopic neobladder (the creation of an artificial internal bladder). These treatments are most successful when tailored to the patient's own lifestyle needs. The current project will explore patient concerns, and the aspects of their lifestyles and values, that influence their choice of bladder reconstruction. It will also examine which of these concerns and values best predict satisfaction and enhanced QoL, following bladder reconstruction. Participants will be recruited from Health Board databases of those who have had advanced bladder cancer (grade pT1 and above) and undergone either IC or NB procedures within the last five years. 40 participants (equal numbers with each surgical procedure) will be randomly selected from the patient databases. They will be interviewed by a Researcher and a Clinical Nurse Specialist. A semi-structured interview will be conducted to ascertain patients' views about the key factors influencing their treatment decision and their satisfaction with the outcome. Approximately 200 participants (equal numbers with IC and NB) will be sent three questionnaires to assess their life values, QoL, and satisfaction with treatment: (1) Bladder Reconstruction Satisfaction Questionnaire measuring levels of satisfaction with bladder reconstruction; (2) EORTC QLQ-C30 measuring QoL in areas relevant to cancer patients; and (3) Life Values Inventory measuring values and lifestyles important to patients. Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaires and return them using a prepaid envelope. Participants will be provided with the contact details of a Clinical Nurse Specialist known to them to contact if they require help completing the questionnaires.

mHealth Intervention to Promote Cancer Survivors' Physical Activity The Primary Goal is to conduct a 5-10 week randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Fitbit Flex, a popular, affordable, wearable physical activity tracking device, and the Fitbit mHealth app. The target population will be childhood cancer survivors 14-18 years old recruited from Seattle Children's Hospital. For the intervention group, peer influences will be engaged via a private, social network (e.g. a Facebook group) customized for survivors. Measurements will be completed (1) at baseline, prior to randomization, and (2) during the final week of the intervention period (follow-up measure). This study will provide initial proof of concept and allow for further customization of the intervention for childhood cancer survivors in anticipation of a future, larger proposal to study physical activity and related outcomes over a multi-year period.
Efficacy and Safety of Low-dose Rituximab in the Treatment of Refractory Myasthenia Gravis This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of low-dose rituximab in patients with refractory myasthenia gravis.  The traditional treatment of MG is immunosuppressive therapy, usually beginning with corticosteroids. However, up to 70% of treated patients show an incomplete response, including 10 - 30% who are unresponsive. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies presented also many side effects. The investigators propose to evaluate in a pilot, open, prospective, single central study, the interest of rituximab (RTX) in the treatment of patients with refractory MG. Fifty patients with refractory MG will be included in the study and divided into two stages: 14 patients in the first stage were followed up after using RTX according to the study protocol. The study will move into the second stage on if the number of effective cases is greater than 3, otherwise, the study will be discontinued (based on Simon's Optimal Two-stage Design). The remaining 36 patients were enrolled in the second stage. In the first and second stages, the treatment plan and follow-up plan were consistent. The therapeutical schema is rituximab 100-200 mg/week for a total of 2-4 times, followed by adequate organ function, laboratory parameters and assessment of MG after each injection and end of follow up for 24 weeks.

The Senior Companion Program Plus Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) is one of the most challenging chronic health conditions in the United States and considerable disparities exist in the diagnosis and prevalence of ADRD among communities of color. Research suggests that ADRD caregiver interventions have demonstrated efficacy, however, it remains unknown whether existing ADRD caregiver interventions are useful or accessible to African American ADRD caregivers in community settings.  The primary goal of the proposed project is to develop an in-home psychoeducational intervention (The Senior Companion Program Plus, or SCP Plus) that is accessible, sustainable, and affordable for African American ADRD caregivers. The SCP Plus will focus on African American ADRD caregivers who are particularly affected by poverty, discrimination, and barriers to health care services and supports. A recent pilot study has established the feasibility and utility of SCP Plus. With the assistance of 6 student research assistants over the course of the project, we will implement the SCP Plus at sites in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, recruiting approximately 114 participants. The participants will be randomized with 57 caregivers receiving the SCP Plus and 57 caregivers receiving services as usual with the Senior Companion Program. A weekly, 60 minute psychoeducational module will be delivered face-to-face across 9 weeks and will focus on education about ADRD, behavior management, communication skills, and aspects of providing care that enhance meaning such as spirituality. In order to provide an accessible and cost effective intervention that is potentially sustainable, senior companions will be trained to provide the intervention in the homes of the African American ADRD caregivers.  Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SCP Plus reduces level of burden and stress among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.  Specific Aim 2. Ascertain if SCP Plus improves coping skills among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.  Specific Aim 3. Examine whether SCP Plus improves the level of satisfaction with support social among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6- month period when compared to a usual care control group.  Specific Aim 4. Explore and interpret the statistical results obtained in the first quantitative phase to help explain why participants who scored in the lower and upper quartiles on caregiver burden/stress were impacted or not by the usefulness of the intervention.  Successful design, delivery, and evaluation of the SCP Plus will lead to a cost effective, sustainable, and accessible intervention that can be implemented in other Senior Companion programs across the country, thus maximizing its impact as a community-based program to address the needs of African American ADRD caregivers.

Elasticity of the Hoffa's Fat Pad in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common problem in clinical settings. Knee OA is well known for its association with the wear and tear of the cartilage and osteophyte formation. Evidence has suggested the importance of the infrapatellar fat pad, known as Hoffa's fat pad, during the development of knee OA. Some studies have demonstrated the protective role of the infrapatellar fat pad, whereas others have suggested an inflammatory role such as increased fibrosis and proinflammatory cytokine levels. Ultrasound is exceptionally convenient in the assessment of the musculoskeletal system, and elastography is a tool to evaluate tissue texture. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the Hoffa's fat pad in knee OA patients by using elastography.
Prospective Characterization of the Heart, Aorta and Blood Pressure in Turner Syndrome. Association With Aortic Dissection. Turner syndrome is a congenital complete or partial lack one of the female sex chromosomes affecting 1 of 2000 live born girls. The syndrome is characterized by an increased prevalence of ischemic heart disease, aortic dilation and dissection, hypertension, stroke and autoimmune diseases in general.  Our study aim is:  * Using MRI to further characterize and find risk factors leading to aortic dilation. * Using MRI to assess the degree of aortic distensibility. * Using Computed tomography x-ray scanning of the heart and coronary arteries to characterize the prevalence and degree of ischemic heart disease and coronary anomalies. * Using pressure sensitive ultrasound (applanation tonometry) to assess the degree of aortic stiffness when compared to controls using end points as Pulse Wave Velocity, Augmentation Index and Central Pulse Pressure.
Robotic Enhanced Error Training of Upper Limb Function in Post-stroke Patients Background: Stroke is a common cause of morbidity, including paresis, and stroke survivors often have reduced function in their paretic arm. Many do not regain full recovery of their arm function, which negatively impacts their quality of life. Recent studies have indicated that robotic training may improve upper limb function abilities among stroke survivors, by enabling repetitive, adaptive, and intensive training and more accurate control of task complexity. Robotic training in addition to standard rehabilitative care has shown promise for improving functional skills among stroke survivors. One type of robotic training is error enhancement, whereby an error made by the patient is exaggerated, increasing the signal to noise ratio which causes errors to be more noticeable. This, in turn, enhances movement correction. Previous studies have found that error enhancement has promise as a clinical treatment for patients with motor deficits.  Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effect of a robotic device (DeXtreme) on the functional capabilities of the paretic arm of stroke survivors. This device aims to improve arm function by utilizing error enhancement techniques.  Methods: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study comparing treatment outcomes between two groups to assess the effect of error enhancement robotic training on functional use of the arm and hand in patients after stroke. Forty stroke patients will undergo 6 sessions of 25 minutes each with the Dextreme device. One group will receive training with error enhancement forces applied, while the control group will receive similar training without error enhancement. Outcomes (motor function, speed, tone, and spasticity) will be assessed twice prior to and following the treatment sessions,
Postpartum Deworming: Improving Breastfeeding and Optimizing Infant Growth Women of reproductive age are considered a high-risk group for worm infections by the World Health Organization. Maternal infection and anemia contribute to infant malnutrition by affecting milk quality and quantity, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding. To date, no study has investigated the health benefits of postpartum deworming to infants or mothers. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Peru to investigate the effectiveness of integrating deworming into routine postpartum care. The primary measure of effect will be infant weight gain between birth and six months of age. Other infant and maternal health indicators will also be ascertained.

Each subject will receive 2-4 of the listed interventions.
Hybrid Coronary Revascularization Trial The purpose of the study is to learn which treatment option is better for patients who have multi-vessel coronary artery disease (blockages in more than one vessel supplying blood to the heart muscle). The treatment options this study will compare are: (1) Hybrid Coronary Revascularization \[HCR\] (a combination of surgery and catheter procedures to open up clogged heart arteries) and (2) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention \[PCI\] (catheter procedures alone to open up clogged heart arteries). There are no new or "experimental" procedures being tested in this study: both HCR and PCI are well-established procedures and are regularly performed in patients who have coronary artery disease. But, the FDA has not approved the drug-eluting stents used in PCI for all types of coronary artery disease. We have received an Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA to use the drug-eluting stents in this trial in the same way that they are used in clinical practice. The study being proposed here will use rigorous scientific methods and should result in a very high level of certainty about which procedure is best for patients with coronary artery disease.

Emotional Regulation, Cognition, Impulsivity and Reward System in Obesity: A Prospective Study of Bariatric Surgery This research investigates obesity and associated psychiatric symptoms and disorders in a wide range of perspectives, to demonstrate the effects of obesity on the brain. The 1st aim is to assess the psychiatric symptom profiles in the group of obese patients applying for bariatric surgery and to determine the associated environmental stress factors. While, it is known that eating disorders, mood disorders and psychiatric drugs can cause obesity, obesity can also cause many psychiatric complications such as depression and cognitive disorders. There are no multi-centered studies that are conducted in this respect, and the guidelines on pre-evaluation and follow-up of patients are also lacking. The 2nd aim is to evaluate and monitor cognitive characteristics before and after bariatric surgery in obese patients. Obese people are at increased risk of dementia and are more likely to have cognitive deficits, especially executive function problems, that can affect everyday life. For this reason, obese individuals should be examined and monitored in more detail in terms of their cognitive characteristics and the change of cognitive functions during the weight loss process. The 3rd aim is to examine the relationship between obesity, bariatric surgery and reward processing system. Studies have been limited in determining whether addiction in these people is due to a search of a continuous substance as a cognitive feature or whether it is difficult to terminate it as an impulsive behavior when encountered with a pleasurable substance, even though there is no reward seeking or reward dependence. The 4th aim is the determination of the neuroanatomical and molecular components of cognitive changes observed after bariatric surgery. During the dynamic process following bariatric surgery, a variety of metabolites, chemokines, and microbiota changes may also affect the brain health and cognition. The 5th aim is to determine factors of eating, emotional regulation, reward system, addiction and impulsivity, and other psychopathologies that cause suboptimal weight loss or weight gain after bariatric surgery. Understanding the psychological and neurobiological factors involved in these processes can improve surgical interventions and significantly increase the quality of life for patients.

Study design: This is a prospective observational study.
Sensitivity and Reproducibility of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography for Assessment of Respiratory Muscle Activity The assessment of respiratory muscle function is critical within both clinical and research settings. Tools for the assessment of respiratory muscle function are especially useful in diagnosing, phenotyping, understanding pathophysiology, and assessing treatment responses in patients with respiratory symptoms, including critically hill patients and patients with respiratory and/or neuromuscular diseases. Respiratory muscle function is most commonly assessed using flow (i.e. spirometry) and pressure measurements during spontaneous ventilation, voluntary respiratory efforts, or artificially evoked responses using magnetic or electrical stimulation. Some of these approaches may be limited within patients suffering from neuromuscular diseases. The study hypothesis is the 18F-FDG PET technology, heavily used for clinical oncology purposes (diagnostic, staging, response to treatment, prognosis), could be an interesting alternative to invasive measurement of the respiratory muscle activity. In addition, it may contribute to further validate metrics based on multiparametric ultrasound imaging.

Treatment of Neonatal Encephalopathy With Oral Sildenafil Suspension to Repair Brain Injury Secondary to Birth Asphyxia Around the time of birth, some babies experience a condition called asphyxia, which means that their brain and other organs do not receive enough blood and/or oxygen to work properly. This life-threatening condition accounts for nearly 1 out of 4 deaths of all babies around the world, and often leads to severe brain damage, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and trouble with learning and functioning in everyday life. At this time, no treatment is available to repair the brain damage caused by asphyxia. Excitingly, a drug called sildenafil (Viagra®) is already given safely to babies who suffer from increased blood pressure in their lungs' vessels. Recent studies using a laboratory model of asphyxia at birth suggest that sildenafil may also repair the brain damage caused by asphyxia. Similarly, recent small studies have shown that it is both feasible and safe to give sildenafil to human babies, who suffered from asphyxia at birth. These studies also highlight the first promising signs that sildenafil may improve how the brains of these babies work, which is consistent with the abovementioned laboratory studies.  On the basis of these previous researches, the investigators predict that sildenafil can repair the damage to a baby's brain. The investigators will test whether sildenafil can be safely given to a large group of human babies who suffer from asphyxia at birth, and will confirm whether sildenafil improves or not how their brains and hearts/lungs work.  This project will enable to determine whether sildenafil is a promising treatment for repairing brain damage in babies who suffer from asphyxia at birth. This project may also provide new solutions for these babies to improve their future life.
Safety and Pharmacokinetics of BPI-9016M in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors BPI-9016M is a novel, highly potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met/Axl kinase. In preclinical studies, it demonstrated strong activity in vitro and in vivo against c-Met/Axl kinase and its downstream signaling targets, and inhibited tumor cell growth. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BPI-9016M with single doses and multiple doses.
Preterm Birth and Social Cognition The study aims at investigating social cognition outcomes of children born prematurely. Social cognition can be briefly defined as a process which underlines people's social and emotional behaviors. There are behavioral and cognitive evidences indicating that preterm children have executive dysfunctions. Executive functions refer to multiple cognitive processes that contribute to human higher order abilities, such as purposeful and future-orientated behavior. The literature regarding development of term born children indicates that executive functions are linked to the emergence of social cognition. Then, the investigators asked if children born prematurely, as they commonly present executive dysfunctions, would show an atypical development of social cognition. Additionally, as it has been shown that parental anxiety is a key factor of preterm children development, the investigators assumed that it should play a role in social cognition outcomes.
Quantitative Real-time Ultrasound Elastography for Characterisation of Liver Tumors Shear Wave Elastography (SWE™) is a quantitative elastography method for measuring tissue stiffness. The difference in stiffness between benign and malignant tumors has been demonstrated by other elastography methods (acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, transient elastography and/or magnetic resonance elastography). The investigators hypothesized that benign liver tumors are softer than malignant liver tumors measured by SWE™, allowing differentiation between the two by tumor stiffness expressed in kilopascal (kPa). In this study benign and malignant liver tumors will be evaluated in five groups: 1) hemangioma and 2) focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) representing the most common benign liver tumors; 3) metastases and 4) cholangiocarcinoma (CCC), both presenting malignant tumors mostly appearing in otherwise healthy liver, and 5) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mostly occurring in cirrhotic liver, which can potentially influence elastographic measurements therefore querying the appropriateness of comparison between tumors in healthy and cirrhotic liver. Enrolled patients will undergo transabdominal ultrasonography and SWE™ examination. The tumor stiffness will be measured five times for each tumor. Additionally, surrounding liver parenchyma stiffness will be measured. The nature of the liver tumor will be defined through a standard diagnostic workup according to current guidelines, including contrast enhanced multi-slice CT, MRI and/or cytology/histology, as applicable. In the final analysis the mean tumor stiffness and tumor-parenchyma ratio will be calculated for each group as well as for benign and malignant tumors separately, and cut-off values for the differentiation of various groups will be derived. The clinical value of the method will be appraised based on specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and AUC.
Safety and Immunogenicity of a Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine. This study is a randomized, blinded and controlled phase II study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (sIPV) in Infants.

Improving Symptom Management for Cancer Patients and Their Caregivers Through Internet Being diagnosed and treated for cancer is usually associated with severe side effects and symptoms. Cancer patients can have difficulty to manage the symptoms as a result of treatment which may cause i) an interruption or cessation of cancer treatment ii) can have a negative impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). Family caregivers (FCs) of cancer patients are often the primary source of social and emotional support for patients, and play major roles in how well patients manage with the consequences of illness and treatment. Thus, FCs are clinically important, since supporting FCs indirectly supports patients.  To help both cancer patients and their FCs to manage their symptoms, our center has developed WebChoice now called Connect, an internet based support system that extends traditional health services into cancer patients' homes.

Hashimotos Thyroiditis and Thyroid Cancer Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. The association between inflammation and cancer is well established but the association between thyroiditis (inflammation of thyroid gland) especially Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and thyroid cancer remains controversial. Chronic inflammation leads to a repeated cycle of cellular damage and subsequent healing which contributes to inappropriate cell proliferation and subsequent neoplastic transformation. One of the most common forms of Thyroiditis is Hashimoto's thyroiditis which is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affects almost 5% of the population and is more common in women. For the first time, Dailey and Lindsay reported in 1955 an increased association between Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) and thyroid cancer. They reported 35 thyroid cancers in 278 patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, a prevalence of 17.7% which they considered higher than the general population . Since then, various studies have been done, some studies have reported an increased risk of malignancy in Hashimoto's thyroiditis; others have failed to find an association. Most of the studies that have been done to identify the association between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid cancer are retrospective. The purpose of this pilot case-control study is to identify the association of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid cancer, to determine if the presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis has any affect on the complication of thyroidectomy and prognostic factors of thyroid cancer.

Adductor Canal Block Versus Femoral Nerve Block With Repeated Bolus Doses Arthroplasty After total knee prosthesis surgery, in the first postopertive days, serious pain complaints occur in the patients and this causes many problems, especially mobility limitation. For this reason, a strong analgesic is needed. As a part of multimodal analgesia after total knee surgery, nerve blocks are frequently preferred. While central nerve blocks are preferred in the forefront, peripheral nerve blocks are frequently preferred due to complications related to central nerve blocks. Femoral nerve block and adductor channel block are the preferred peripheral blocks for total knee prosthesis. Since early mobilization after total hip prosthesis is very important, it is aimed to provide sufficient analgesia by making less motor block. Previous studies have shown that adductor channel block provides similar analgesia with femoral nerve block. Early mobilization, early discharge and the impact on the risk of falls are not yet clear, although it is estimated to be in the positive direction. Again, previous studies have compared single doses and infusion doses but no repeated bolus doses. Repeated bolus doses have been shown to be more effective in studies in which adductor channel catheters have been introduced to date to compare infusion and recurrent bolus doses.  investigators aimed to compare the effects of repeated bolus doses with femoral nerve catheter and adductor channel catheter on postoperative pain and muscle strength in patients undergoing total knee replasment under spinal anesthesia in this study.

Intermittent Catheterization Acceptance Test The aim of the study is to create and validate a specific test named Intermittent Catheterization Acceptance Test (I-CAT), assessing "the acceptance" of clean intermittent self catheterization (CISC) in a neurological and no neurological population with indication to self catheterization.  CISC avoids urological complications in bladder with chronic and improves quality of life. Despite theses challenges, the learning of CISC can face some physical, cognitive and psychological difficulties. Recently, we have validate a new test for predicting the physical and cognitive abilities to practice CISC named "PP-Test". Meanwhile, psychological factors are not explored in this test. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted in order to demonstrate in a prospective trial, which kind of psychological barriers can exist. Likewise it would be interesting to create a new test assessing the psychological "acceptance" of the patients to CISC before learning (I-CAT). Based on the results of this self-assessment test, the specific nurse could then change her speech by playing down the importance of some fear and anxiety described by the patients. The learning of CISC would be facilitated.

Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir Treatment for Hepatitis C in HCT Recipients. The prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection was reported to range between 10% and up to 30% prior to institution of routine HCV screening in recipients of HCT (hematopoietic cell transplantation). In an Italian prospective study 6% of HCT candidates were positive for HCV RNA. HCV in recipients of HCT carries both short-term and long-term consequences. In the short-term those with HCV after hematopoietic cell transplantation have been associated with risk for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome especially in patients with some level of hepatic dysfunction going in to the transplant. In addition, the type of conditioning chemotherapy (e.g., busulfan) and radiation may increase risk for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The rate of hematopoietic recovery was found to be lower in HCV infected recipients, with delayed neutrophil and platelet engraftment.  In the long-term, HCV may flare up once immunosuppression is being tapered off. The issue of reactivation of viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV) after HCT has been well documented. The risk for HCV reactivation in allogenic HCT in one study was reported at 100% by 12 months after HCT, with risk for death related to HCV of 8%. Also, of concern is rapid progression of liver disease in long-term survivors of HCV+ HCT. In such patients, cumulative incidence of cirrhosis has been reported in up to 11% and 24% at 15 and 20 years after HCT respectively.  Hepatitis C infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, due to the short-term and long-term complications associated with it. Treatment of hepatitis C virus with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents pre-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in candidates with hepatitis C may lead to reduction of both short-term and long-term complications from it.  Treatment with DAA's pre-HCT in candidates with hepatitis C would potentially prevent complications of hepatitis C infection; prevent reactivation of hepatitis C post-HCT, prevent delay in hematopoietic recovery (especially neutrophils and platelet), possibly reduce risk for sinsusoidal obstruction syndrome, prevent relapse of malignancy that could be related to hepatitis C (non-Hodgkin lymphoma), reduce non-relapse mortality and long-term complications (cirrhosis).
Right Lateral Positioning and Its Effect on Induction of General Anesthesia for Children The quality of induction with sevoflurane, along with its ability to generate optimal conditions for Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) insertion without supplemental opioids or muscle relaxants, has also been well documented.

Parents Advancing Toddler Health Although early interventions can improve health equity in young children living in poverty, this promise often is not realized because of barriers to family engagement. The proposed study will target co-morbid behavior and sleep problems in early childhood, comparing child outcomes and family response to sleep and behavior interventions and investigating the novel strategy of letting families select their intervention.We will enroll 500 low-income toddlers with co-morbid sleep and behavior problems, randomized to 4 parent coaching interventions: sleep, behavior, family choice (sleep or behavior), and an active control. At baseline and at 1, 5, and 9 months post- intervention, we will assess child sleep and behavior and family functioning. We will measure family preference, engagement, and perceived value of each intervention. The goals of the study are: (1) to examine effects of evidence- based sleep and behavior interventions in young low-income children with co-morbid sleep and behavior problems on child sleep and behavior and family functioning; (2) to determine whether parents prefer, engage with, and value a sleep or behavior intervention more; and (3) to examine if giving families a choice of intervention results in higher engagement, higher perceived value and better family and child outcomes than assignment to intervention. By informing best practices for engaging low-income families to treat co-morbid sleep and behavior problems, results will be critical to reducing health disparities for children living in poverty.

Sodium Stibogluconate Treatment of Leishmaniasis Leishmanias is a disease caused by the bite of sandflies and is found in many parts of the world including the Europe, Southwest Asia, Africa and the Middle East. This disease is a threat for military soldiers in areas where this disease is found. Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or Pentostam (Glaxo Smith Kline, United Kingdom) is an Investigational New Drug (IND) product used by the Department of Defense for over 20 years to treat cutaneous, mucosal and viseral leishmanias. This drug is not licensed for commercial use in the United States because of very limited need for the product in the U.S.A. The objective of this protocol is to provide sodium stibogluconate for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal leishmaniasis (pentavalent antimonials curently considered the drug of choice for these infections) Provide sodium stibogluconate as a second line treatment for viscerotropic and visceral leishmaniasis (liposomal amphotericin is the drug of choice for these types as it is FDA approved for vusceral leishmaniasis).
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) Challenge Study on Healthy Subjects This exploratory study aims to assess exposure of healthy subjects to systemic challenge with either LPS or GM-CSF. This will be done by measuring inflammatory mediators and cellular activation markers both in circulation and in skin blisters induced by exposure to cantharidin (an agent that causes blisters). LPS is often used to induce inflammation whereas GM-CSF is a cytokine and a key mediator in inflammatory diseases. In this 2 parts study, subjects will have 2 sessions in each part. Part I of the study is a dose-exploration phase and part II will be a continuation phase to draw more precise outcomes. In session 1, subjects will be randomized to receive either LPS or GM-CSF and will have 2 blisters induced on each forearm followed by blood draws and a blister harvest on each forearm at 24 and 48 hours post-induction. After a minimum of 14 days blister healing period, subjects will return for session 2. In part I, Up to 6 cohorts will be tested and all cohorts will have 2 sessions. For Part I, initially Cohort 1 will proceed with session 1. After their blister healing period, Cohort 1 will return for their session 2 visit in two groups (Group A and Group B) on different days. Group A will be dosed on the same day (one with LPS and one with GM-CSF) and Group B will be dosed on a different day (one with LPS and one with GM-CSF) after group A. Dose-escalation in Cohort 2-6 will be continued until the well tolerated dose has been determined. The same dose will be administered to an additional Cohort in Part II and the same 2-session design will be used. Approximately 24-30 healthy subjects will be enrolled for the study and the total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 13 weeks from screening to follow up.

DARWeb: an Online Psychosocial Intervention for Children With Recurrent Abdominal Pain and Their Families. Chronic and recurrent pain is a very important issue in the society, and its treatment is challenging.  In children, one of the most common pain problems is recurrent abdominal pain. This problem can affect up to 12% of the children population, and can interfere on daily activities of both children and parents. Recurrent abdominal pain in children is also associated with other health problems, and can be related to problems in adulthood. Unfortunately, the current health system does not have an effective treatment for these children and their families. This is why the investigators propose an online intervention, DARWeb, for people in this situation.  DARWeb provides an innovative solution using Information and Communication Technology to facilitate access. It is also innovative because it is directed towards secondary prevention, in contrast to the majority of current treatments available for pain problems that are focused in reducing the impact of pain when it is already severe. Thus, the objective of DARWeb is to provide information and teach strategies to children and their parents that help them to cope with pain and prevent pain interference in their daily lives (in the short, medium and long term).  With this project, the investigators plan, first, to create a new version of their treatment program (DARWeb V2) from the results of the pilot study. Second, the investigators will test the effects of DARWeb V2 through a randomized clinical trial with a large sample, and they will assess the short, medium and long term effects. In addition, the investigators want to study which of the variables that are addressed in their intervention are responsible for the potential changes observed.  The investigators expect that their treatment program will be effective to reduce pain in the short, medium and long term.
Blue Enriched Versus Standard Light Treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder(SAD) One of the most frequently investigated hypothesis of the pathophysiology underlying Seasonal Affective Disorder(SAD) or so called winterdepression is a disturbance of circadian rhythms. Since the circadian system is especially sensitive for the blue portion of the light spectrum, a new light therapy device with more blue light (blue enriched polychromatic light) was tested for its efficacy to treat SAD. In chronobiological terms this light is hypothesized to be more potent in inducing non-visual effects. In the present study fluorescent tubes that emit a high portion of short wavelength light on top of the normal wavelengths are tested for its superiority in treating SAD. This blue-enriched light (colour temperature 17000 ºK) is compared to standard light treatment (5000 º K) in SAD patients., The investigators hypothesise that blue- enriched light improve the therapeutic effects of light treatment leading to a higher response or the same response in a shorter time schedule compared to standard light treatment.
Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Using Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 in Patients With a Heart Attack When a patient has a heart attack, a blockage occurs in a coronary artery that delivers oxygen to the heart muscle. The heart muscle may weaken, causing heart failure. The body naturally makes a protein called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that may protect the heart muscle cells from dying and may prevent heart failure or lessen the damage that occurs. IGF-1 is also available as a drug called mecasermin. In this study, heart attack patients will be given either a dose of mecasermin or a placebo (inactive treatment) after their coronary artery has been opened by a stent. The purpose of the study will be to evaluate the safety of the therapy and to test if the therapy will prevent or lessen heart failure by evaluating a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken one day and eight weeks after the heart attack.

Fresh-Frozen Plasma Infusions to Reduce Risk of Bleeding Related to Invasive Procedures This study will compare patients with mild to moderate prolongation of the INR test who receive FFP infusions prior to invasive hepatobiliary procedures for bleeding complications to patients who do not receive FFP infusions. Bleeding complications will be defined as meeting one or more of the following:  1. Intrahepatic hematoma greater than 1 ml/kg of patient weight as seen on post-procedure ultrasound examination performed between 4 to 30 hours after the procedure. 2. Greater than 1.6g/dL hemoglobin decline measured within 4 to 30 hours post-procedure compared with the pre-procedure value, in the absence of another identified bleeding source to account for the hemoglobin drop. 3. Need for transfusion of packed red blood cells for procedure-related bleeding while in the study.  The secondary endpoints of this study will be: 1) The need to perform subsequent procedures (angiography, embolization, additional imaging study including computerized tomography (CT) scan, surgery) to diagnose or to arrest procedure-related bleeding OR the need for subsequent medical therapies (FFP, coagulation factor concentrates, anti-fibrinolytics) to treat procedure-related bleeding between time of procedure and the end of patient's time in the study. If necessary, the relationship of procedure or therapy to procedure-related bleeding will be assessed by an adjudication panel; 2) The predictive value of INR; 3) The effect of study treatment on change in INR; 4) The cost of preventing one bleed; 5) The predictors of bleeding other than INR; 6) The number of transfusion-associated adverse events encountered to prevent one bleed; and 7) The effect of treatment on bleeding grade.

Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer This randomized phase II trial studies abiraterone acetate and prednisone together with veliparib to see how well it works compared to abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread from the primary site to other places in the body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antiandrogen drugs, such as abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving abiraterone acetate together with prednisone and veliparib may work better than abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
The Efficacy of Kinesio Taping With Therapy in the Treatment of Globus Pharyngeus Globus pharyngeus or sensation may be defined as a feeling of something a lump in the throat without dysphagia.

Although it is not a treatment with full consensus, the patient's complaints can be corrected with a small number of different therapy techniques or regulations on life.
The Clinical Effect of i-FACTOR® Versus Allograft in Non-instrumented Posterolateral Spondylodesis Operation in the Elderly With Spinal Stenosis Due to Degenerative Spondylolisthesis The average life expectancy in Denmark is increasing resulting in an increasing part of the population having age-related disease, ex lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). LSS causes constriction of the nerves in the lumbar spine resulting in pain in the legs and lower back, especially when standing and walking, known as neurogenic claudication(Goh KJ FAU - Khalifa et al.). LSS occurs in a combination of degenerative changes in the lower back, including hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavus, arthrosis of the facet joints and bulging of the disc.  Current treatment of LSS is varied ranging from non-operative conservative treatment to operation.  Operative intervention shows very good results according to physical ability and pain(Christensen FB et al.;Hee HT and Wong;McGregor AH FAU - Hughes and Hughes;Xu et al.), but the most optimal treatment is still debated. Nevertheless, a decompression and, if needed, a spinal fusion is recommended.(Ausman).  Clinical improvement including decrease of pain, improved ADL-function and an increased quality of life are parameters of highest interest and the purpose of an operation is clear: Making sufficient room for the affected nerves. In addition fusion is desired achieving stability avoiding a new compression of the nerves. Studies attending these issues find a correlation between fusion and clinical outcome, why obtained fusion of the affected levels are very important(Andersen et al.;Andersen et al.;Girardo et al.;Kornblum MB FAU - Fischgrund et al.).  P-15, bound to Anorganisk Bone Mineral (ABM), called i-FACTOR®, shows fusion superiority, no side effects and no risk of transferring disease(Thorwarth et al. 5648-57;Thorwarth et al. 789-95;Wenz, Oesch, and Horst 1599-606;Scarano et al. 318-24;Kubler et al. 171-79) why the investigators find this material suited for fusion surgery in the elderly.  To the investigators knowledge this is the first prospective study comparing fusion rates and postoperative clinic with i-FACTOR vs allograft in older patients operated with decompression and spondylodesis because of spinal stenosis due to degenerative spondylolisthesis.  Hypothesis:  There are no difference in the clinical parameters measured by ODI and fusion rates comparing i-FACTOR® and allograft in non-instrumented posterolateral spondylodesis-operations in patients 60 years and older.

Non-hypovascular Solid Pancreatic Lesions: Role of EUS Vascular pattern of solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) has been investigated by different abdominal imaging modalities and by contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography (CE-EUS). Compared with surrounding pancreatic parenchyma three different patterns have been described: hypo-, iso-, and hypervascular. The majority of SPLs are hypovascular, and the diagnostic relevance of hypoenhanced pattern to predict pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is well established. Differently, iso- and hypervascular pattern is not specific and can be expressed by several SPLs, with different clinical behavior and management. To date, poor is know about the role of EUS in differential diagnosis of non-hypovascular SPLs and features associated with malignancy.

Honey Used as Adjunct Therapy to Tylenol for Post-Op Tonsillectomy Patients Tonsillectomies are the second most common surgery with over half a million procedures in the United States for 2006. Tonsillectomies are considered a painful surgical procedure performed on children resulting in pain and nausea/vomiting for up to 7 days postoperatively. Up until recently, doctors have been prescribing upwards of ten days' worth of opioid pain medication for children following tonsillectomies due to the high incidence of pain expected afterwards. Effective July 1st, 2018, new laws regarding opioid restrictions came into place that restricted doctor's abilities to write for more than three days' worth of opioid pain medication without having to fill out sizeable amounts of additional paperwork. This law was put in place to combat the ongoing opioid epidemic that plagues this country. What the investigators are left with for the treatment of pain following these procedures are simply Tylenol and Motrin with a limited amount of opioid. With this being considered a highly painful surgery with a difficult recovery, more options are needed to effectively treat pain and reduce the incidence of emergency room visits and phone calls to the clinic regarding pain control in the postoperative period.  Studies in Europe have shown that honey is an effective adjunct treatment option in the reduction of pain in pediatric postoperative tonsillectomies. These studies are few and far between and more research needs to be conducted to validate these claims particularly in the United States where research on this subject has been extremely limited. Further, the extent to which families and health care providers in the United States would be receptive to using honey for children's postoperative pain is unclear since honey is considered a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention.

Acute Effect of Intensive Insulin Infusion on Intestinal Triglyceride-rich-lipoprotein-apoB48 Metabolism in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCD) is the first cause of morbidity and mortality at type 2 diabetes. The typical dyslipidemia that is associated with insulin resistance, which includes a postprandial elevation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) with excess of intestinal triglyceride-rich-lipoprotein-apoB48 (TRL-apoB48), is felt to play an important role in the accelerated ASCD.  The investigators' objectives in this study are to determine whether an acute elevation of plasma insulin, secondarily to plasma insulin infusion, modulates the production and the clearance rates of intestinal TRL-apoB48 in type 2 diabetic patients in the fed state and to determine if this is a direct effect of insulin or an indirect effect due to the decrease of plasma FFA or the decrease of plasma glucose.

Evaluation Methodology of Emotional States for People With Cerebral Palsy The objective of this study is to determine what are the most robust parameters for the measurement of emotional states in users suffering from cerebral palsy. Users have different ages (adults and children) with different capacities. Measures will be taken in different contexts where users will do several tasks pleasant and unpleasant. Some of the tasks involve physical activity, which must be taken into account due to the possible disturbance that it can introduce in the measures taken.  It is intended to detect states of demotivation, fatigue, or physical or emotional stress. For this, we will use signals of two types: physiological measurements and inertial sensors. The handicap we find is that the subjects have difficulties expressing and recognizing emotional states, which rules out the use of a self-assessment test to contrast the measures taken. This makes us turn to their caregivers or family members or alternatively or in a complementary way to take measurements in contexts or situations of daily life where the emotional state induced in the subject is known.  Once the parameters were established, the measurement of the emotional state will allow us to make a real-time evaluation of how the users are feeling during the tasks, in this way the activity can be better conducted by adapting it so that it is as efficient as possible and takes us to good results.  Music will be studied as a motivating factor and for improving the emotional state when approaching rehabilitation therapies.  There will be 4 sessions during which measurements will be recorded.  1: measurement of this parameter when he or she is in an activity of daily life that is pleasurable. 2: measurement of this parameter when he or she is in an activity of daily life that is of discomfort. 3: Measurement of this parameter during the performance of rehabilitation activities. 4: Measurement of this parameter during rehabilitation activities accompanied with music according to the preferences.
Plethysmographic Pulse-contour and Pulse-wave-transit-times for Haemodynamic Evaluation in Bleeding Simulation The evaluation of haemodynamic changes is still challenging in clinically relevant situations (e.g. in bleeding, septic and postoperative patients) with the conventional monitoring routinely used including heart rate and mean arterial pressure. If the arterial pressure drops and the heart increases, the haemodynamic state is already decompensated and a therapy is at risk being indicated too late.  Prior to decompensation - still in the state of compensated shock - it would be desirable to detect the shock already. The compensated shock is characterized by an occult drop of cardiac output and a hypoperfusion of vital organs like e.g. the splanchnic region. Due to these pathophysiological characteristics, a therapy would be indicated already in this stadium of shock progression.  The available monitoring tools to detect compensated shock are on the one hand side invasive (intravascular catheter), cost-intensive (cost of the catheter systems), or need extensive training (echocardiography). Consequently, the implementation of advanced haemodynamic monitoring is still low despite the high clinical relevance for the patients.  It is the goal of this project to evaluate in healthy volunteers the routinely implemented technology of photo-plethysmography in its ability to detect haemodynamic changes by extended signal analysis of the pulse-contour and the pulse-wave-transit-times in relation to the gold-standard echocardiography.  Secondary goal of this study is to analyse the physiological and haemodynamic changes during progressive central hypovolaemia displayed by non-invasive or minimal-invasive monitoring devices and associate the changes to each other.

Can Cognitive-bias Modification Training During Inpatient Alcohol Detoxification Reduce Relapse Rates Post-discharge? It is well-established that many substance misusers experience impairment in cognition (thinking skills), particularly those needed to regulate and monitor behaviour and ensure that goals are achieved. According to the dual-process model, addiction arises from an imbalance in 'bottom-up' processing i.e., overactive automatic (impulsive) processes that drive behaviours and impaired 'top-down' controlling processes that stop behaviours associated with negative consequences. As a result, the individual becomes more sensitive to cues in their environment (e.g., alcohol images) that trigger the addictive behaviour. Cognitive-bias modification (CBM) is a novel, computer-based training paradigm that trains the brain to pay less attention to negative/harmful cues and more attention to positive or neutral cues. This approach minimizes the overactive 'bottom-up' processes and improves the 'top-down' control processes of unhealthy behaviors which enables the addicted individual to make better decisions. Recently, CBM has been used with addicted population to alter the tendency to approach alcohol, with one German study showing that a 4-session training programme was associated higher rates of abstinence at one-year (Wiers et al., 2011). The current study examines whether a novel computer based training programme alters cognitive biases (the tendency to approach alcohol related stimuli) in alcohol-dependent inpatients, and examine whether this enables them to be better at decision-making more generally, and its impact on craving and post-discharge abstinence rates. The study will also explore whether individual differences in impulsivity and sensitivity to reward and punishment determine response to the training programme. This will be achieved using a parallel-groups randomized superiority trial design involving approximately 80 patients attending inpatient withdrawal programmes in Victoria. The findings are likely to have implications for the design and delivery of psychosocial interventions delivered during early recovery from alcohol-dependence to optimise treatment effectiveness.
DECAMP-1: Diagnosis and Surveillance of Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules The goal is to improve the efficiency of the diagnostic follow-up of patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules by determining whether biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis that are measured in minimally invasive biospecimens are able to distinguish malignant from benign pulmonary nodules that are incidentally detected in high-risk smokers.
Quality Control of Ultrasound Images During Early Pregnancy Via AI This research integrates artificial intelligence to enhance early pregnancy ultrasonography quality control, focusing on specific fetal sections. In collaboration with prominent medical institutions, the investigators have amassed extensive fetal ultrasound data. The investigators aim to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify essential anatomical areas in ultrasound images and evaluate their quality. This tool is expected to significantly decrease misdiagnoses of conditions like Down Syndrome and neural system deformities by ensuring real-time image quality assessment.
Air Cleaners for Children and Adolescents With Asthma and Dog Allergy The purpose is to find out if Icleen IQAir, HEPA-filter air cleaners with high capacity and pre-set speed functions, have a beneficial effect on patients with asthma and allergy to dogs.  Air cleaners will be installed in the bedrooms and living rooms in the homes of children and adolescents aged 8-17 years at the study entry, with allergy to dogs, but not to house dust mites.  The investigators will look upon the significance of this study, and of a previous study with a similar design and the same main parameters to find out if this trial supports the results of the first trial by the same project leader, or makes it likely that the seemingly beneficial effects of the first study occurred by chance.  Main parameters:  * hyperventilation cold air challenge test  Supportive parameters:  * serum ECP * symptom scores  The trial will be a parallel, double blind placebo controlled one.
Influence of Smoking on Clinical, Microbiological and Immunologic Parameters in Patients With Aggressive Periodontitis. Treatment of smoker patients with AgP is considered a challenge to periodontists. To date, only one controlled clinical study (De Genaro Modanese et al., 2016) evaluated the effect of full mouth ultrasonic debridment (FMUD) on smokers with aggressive periodontitis. Its results showed significant improvements in clinical parameters (plaque index PI, bleeding on probing- BoP and probing depth-PD), and immunologic (reductions in interleukin 6- IL-6, tumor necrosis factor- α TNF-α levels), although the results were more favorable for non-smoking patients. Antimicrobials associated to mechanical therapy has been extensively studied (Hafajee et al., 2003, Heitz-Mayfield, 2006). The association of Amoxicillin and Metronidazole have had good clinical and microbiological results in randomized clinical trials in the treatment of AgP (Casarin et al., 2012, Sgolastra et al., 2012, Keestra et al., 2015).  Thus, this study investigates clinical, microbiological and immunological influence of smoking in the periodontal debridement associated to Amoxiciclin and Metronidazole of young individuals with pronounced periodontal destruction, compared with non-smokers individuals.
Metabolic Control and Patient Well-being in Phenylketonuria: do Guidelines Make a Difference? Treatment of PKU implies for most patients that with strict adherence to dietary treatment they can achieve excellent neurocognitive outcome. Dietary treatment, though, is hard to comply to every day and with every single meal. Unsurprisingly, health-related quality of life (HrQol) is negatively affected if patients have to follow a dietary regime of this kind. Adherence to treatment in PKU is very variable. Factors of significant impact on adherence to treatment and well-being in chronic disease such as self-efficacy or parenting stress have not yet been widely investigated in PKU patients.  The ideal treatment prescription (and guideline) recommends as much as necessary and as little as possible, based on the best evidence available. Patients should neither be deprived of treatment options nor be exposed to overtreatment.  This study investigates adherence, metabolic control, HrQol in PKU patients treated by centres which follow different guidelines

Increasing Attendance to Cervical Cancer-screening Among Immigrants Although health-related interventions should become increasingly diversity-sensitive, there will always be a need of adapting specific interventions to some immigrant populations. Adapting selected services to the individual cultural and religious background is necessary to reduce health inequalities and provide effective health care and is dependent on the active involvement of users. In this proposal the investigators present a community-based health intervention trial with two parallel interventions aimed at increasing participation of immigrant women to the existing cervical cancer-screening program. Through this study, the investigators will provide new practice-based knowledge and a firmer evidence base to improve health interventions that can contribute to equal health care and good health for all - including the immigrant population.  Based on identified barriers and factors that influence the interactions between immigrants and health care professionals for screening of cervical cancer in Norway, the investigators have develop two adapted interventions. One strategy will target immigrant women, and the other one will focus on general practitioners. Thus, this proposal will specifically contribute to the development of personalized health prevention interventions for the most common cancer-screening program in Norway, with a focus on immigrant's personal circumstances and health care needs.

Efficacy of rTMS as an Adjunct to AI Enabled Remedial Intervention in Children With Dyslexia Dyslexia is the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children, with prevalence rates ranging from 17.5% to 21%. Studies have shown incomplete response to remediation and behavioural therapies in children with dyslexia. Evidence from neuroimaging studies as well as neuromodulation studies supporting a neurobiological basis of dyslexia is extensive according to which under-activation and poor connectivity in the underlying pathways for language and reading is the primary pathophysiology underlying reading difficulties. Evidence from studies on neuromodulation have shown that by combining remedial intervention with neuromodulation there is a synergistic effect through the mechanism of long term potentiation. In view of the above mentioned our study aims to investigate the role of Hf rTMS as an adjunct to AI enabled remedial intervention in children with dyslexia in improving their reading abilities.

Pain Management of Emergency Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Patients With Acute Cholecystitis Patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis benefit from emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Patients who had emergency LC showed improvement in quality of life in one month compared to those treated. Delayed LC (after the acute cholecystitis has passed) and less time to recover from work. This strategy reduces the risk of repeated referrals with more pain or pancreatitis. There are many studies on the efficacy of intraoperative intraperitoneal bupivacaine(IPBV) with elective LC on pain of IPBV. However, the prospective study of reducing the postoperative pain of emergency LC - IPBV is very few. This study will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of IPBV in patients with emergency LC.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Bariatric Gastric Bypass Surgery: Effect on Liver Volume, Immune Response and Erythrocyte Function Gastric bypass surgery is the gold standard in bariatric surgery and is a successful method to reduce weight in morbidly obese subjects. Patients qualified for gastric bypass surgery are routinely pre-treated with a low calorie diet in order to reduce liver volume and to facilitate the approach of the gastro-oesophageal junction. Pre-treatment with omega-3 fatty acids has similar effects on liver volume, but a prospective comparison of both treatments has not been performed yet. Morbidly obese patients respond differently to surgical stress, due to a number of factors. First, obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammatory state induced by an increased amount of macrophages in adipose tissue. This state is associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and with a less adequate immune response to infections. Second, obesity is associated with an altered cortisol metabolism possibly related to adrenal insufficiency. This could play an important role in the altered response to surgical stress and postoperative complications in obese subjects. Third, obesity is associated with altered erythrocyte function, including decreased erythrocyte deformability and increased aggregation, factors contributing to an impaired microcirculation.  This study has a number of different aims. First, we will compare pre-treatment with the standard low calorie diet with omega-3 fatty acids on liver volume in patients qualified for gastric bypass surgery because of morbid obesity. Second, we will investigate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on immune function, the low-inflammatory state of adipose tissue, the stress response of obese subjects before and erythrocyte function. Third, we will investigate the effect of gastric bypass surgery by comparing values before surgery with values on the first postoperative day and 6 months after surgery regarding to immunological parameters, stress response and erythrocyte function.
Blood Flow Restriction Exercise for Those With SCI Spinal cord injuries (SCI) are among the most debilitating conditions an individual can sustain with the estimates of SCI incidence in the United States at 12,000 new cases per year. The loss of innervation to the tissues muscle below the level of the lesion results in reduced physical activity which leads to an array of secondary complications including muscle atrophy, cardiovascular and metabolic disease, obesity and vascular dysfunction. This further leads to exercise intolerance, reduced quality of life and depression. Although current rehabilitative programs focus on improving muscle strength in this population, the efficacy of these programs is challenged by the injury related motor impairment, which limits the exercise intensity and subsequent positive muscular adaptations. Therefore, development of an exercise program that promotes maximal muscular adaptations to light intensity exercise could greatly improve the efficacy of rehabilitation in the SCI population and help restore functional capacity and quality of life for these individuals. Blood flow restriction (BFR) exercise has shown tremendous promise for improving muscle size and strength in a variety of healthy and clinical populations, however the benefits of BFR exercise for those with SCI has not been established. Thus, the purpose of this Merit proposal is to conduct a comprehensive study that explores the benefits and risks of BFR exercise in the incomplete SCI population. In general individuals with chronic incomplete SCI will be recruited to partake in two 8-week training periods (20 sessions) that involve traditional knee extension/flexion exercise or knee extension/flexion exercise with blood flow restriction. There will be a series of measurements before and after the 8-week intervention to look at changes in muscle and vascular function. Specific Aim 1 will determine how the 8-weeks of BFR exercise influenced muscle strength (Biodex isokinetic dynamometer), muscle cross sectional area and volume (CTscan) and fatigue resistance. Specific Aim 2 will determine how this novel 8-week training intervention impacts peripheral vascular function. Specifically, changes in nitric oxide mediated endothelial function will be determined through tests of flow mediated dilation, changes in endothelial function of the microvascular network will be determined through assessments of reactive hyperemia and changes in arterial stiffness will be determined through measurements of pulse wave velocity. Specific Aim 3 will focus on the safety of BFR exercise for the SCI population. Those with SCI are at greater risk for thrombosis and DVT compared to able bodied individuals. Although unlikely, the introduction of temporary blood stasis during BFR exercise might augment this risk. Thus, the third aim of this study will be to determine changes in innate immune activation and thrombosis risk. Specifically, blood will be collected at multiple timepoints throughout the training intervention and analyzed for hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, neutrophil extra cellular traps (which act as prothrombotic scaffolds), neutrophil-platelet aggregates and inflammatory cytokines. Ultimately, if the improvements in muscle and vascular function following BFR resistance exercise is greater than the traditional resistance exercise often performed in rehabilitation settings, without increasing risk for DVT, it should be incorporated into the long-term rehabilitation programs for Veterans with SCI.
Partially Covered Versus Uncovered Pyloro-duodenal Stents for Unresectable Malignant Gastric Outlet Obstruction. A Double Blinded Randomised Controlled Trial. To compare the efficacy of a novel partially covered (PC) versus uncovered (UC) pyloro-duodenal stents (DS) in unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction. We hypothesize that the use of PCDS could reduce the re-intervention rates when compared to UCDS.
New Approach of Assessing Drug Response for Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Cancer The combination of pEBV DNA (half-life) and PET-CT following 1 course of chemotherapy allow earlier and more detection of drug response in advanced NPC than RECIST method, in patients with previously untreated advanced NPC who will receive platinum-based chemotherapy. This study will also determine if this new method can predict survival in these patients. This study may have far-reaching impact on drug development in NPC as it may offer a more optimal way of evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials and also in clinical management.

Mechanism of Incontinence Before and After Genital Prolapse Surgery Since year 2003, Glostrup/Herlev Hospital has devised a novel technique, urethral pressure reflectometry (UPR), for measurements of pressure and cross-sectional area in the female urethra. UPR has been able to separate continent women from women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI, defined by involuntary leakage during increased abdominal pressure). The method stands alone in its field.  9.5 % of all women undergo genital prolapse surgery during their lives (genital prolapse is characterized by a portion of the vaginal canal protruding from the opening of the vagina). However, 10-30 % of these women develop SUI after surgery, while approximately 40 % with preoperative SUI actually experience an improvement in their condition. Efforts have been made to predict the likelihood of a patient having SUI after genital prolapse surgery; however the tests have shown disappointing positive and negative predictive values.  A mid-urethral sling is gold standard for treatment of SUI and to avoid SUI after genital prolapse surgery, some clinics choose to treat all their patients with a sling, simultaneously. However, not all patients with SUI require surgery and the sling is associated with some risks, such as bleeding and bladder injury. There is no international consensus on the use of mid-urethral slings in women undergoing genital prolapse surgery. Thus, there is great need for knowledge and know-how regarding the mechanism of continence in women with genital prolapse, before and after surgery.  The hypothesis is that UPR may be used to uncover the changes in the female urethra before and after genital prolapse surgery, revealing significant differences in the parameters in women who develop SUI after surgery. UPR may become an important tool in the preoperative assessment, helping clinicians give better information and guidance to their patients.

Subjects on this arm will receive a low-protein diet containing 10% protein.  Patients with metastatic, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic CRPC that has progressed despite androgen deprivation therapy will be eligible for the study. After informed consent eligible patients will be scheduled to receive sipuleucel-T (three infusions two weeks apart) with normal-protein diet vs. low-protein diet. Each cycle will be every 14 days. Diet intervention will commence 1 week prior to the first apheresis (Day -7) and will continue until 10 days after the last infusion of sipuleucel-T (Day +42) (Fig. 2).
STerOids in COVID-19 Study At the time of writing (3/4/2020), close to a million people have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus around the world. The severe clinical condition that leads to deaths is now called CoVID-19. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the early or late stages of this illness. Governments worldwide have undertaken dramatic interventions to try and reduce the rate of spread of this deadly coronavirus.  Early data from multiple studies in China, where the virus originated, show that severe cases of CoVID-19 are not as prevalent in patients with chronic lung diseases as expected. This data has been confirmed by the Italian physicians. The investigators think that the widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the risk of CoVID-19 pneumonia in patients with chronic lung disease. Early microbiological data also shows that these corticosteroids are effective at slowing down the rate of coronavirus replication on lung cells.  Inhaled corticosteroids are widely used to manage common lung conditions, such as asthma. This type of medicine is among the top 3 most common medication prescribed around the world. Their safety is well understood, and their potential side effects are mild and reversible.  The investigators propose to test this idea that, in participants early in the course of CoVID-19 illness, daily high dose inhaled corticosteroids for 28 days, will reduce the chances of severe respiratory illness needing hospitalisation. We will also study the effect of this inhaled therapy on symptoms and viral load.

HCV Treatment Initiation During Acute Psychiatric Admission Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disproportionally affects certain populations, including those facing substance use and mental health challenges. In the past, many individuals with mental illness were not treated due to the psychiatric side-effects of interferon. However, the development of highly effective, direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has revolutionized HCV treatment such that cure rates are \>95% with 8-12 weeks of simple, safe, and well-tolerated therapy.  A recent systematic review reported that across 13 North American studies, HCV prevalence among people admitted to psychiatric hospitals was a staggering 17.4% (13.2-22.6%). Despite these concerning figures, mental health facilities have not been a focus of HCV elimination efforts to date. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto is the largest mental health facility in Canada, with a psychiatric emergency department seeing \~35 patients per day with many admitted to the acute psychiatric units for safety and stabilization. Currently, psychiatric patients screened for HCV at CAMH have a 75% 'no show' rate at the Toronto Centre for Liver Disease (TCLD), which is located less than 5km away, suggesting that referral upon discharge is ineffective.  This study will be the first trial to evaluate whether it would be feasible and beneficial to initiate treatment during an acute psychiatric admission rather than referring to specialty upon discharge. The combination of broad HCV screening with rapid linkage to treatment has led to successful elimination of HCV within defined populations, so-called micro-elimination. The investigators hypothesize that HCV treatment can be effectively delivered by providers in psychiatric care facilities, which will improve treatment uptake over traditional referral models.
Feasibility of Using SPECT/CT Imaging to Map Lymphatic Drainage Patterns in Prostate Cancer Patients The purpose of this study is to develop a practice procedure for lymphatic drainage mapping with the intent of providing a new tool that could potentially be used for radiation treatment planning. High-risk prostate cancer patients who are scheduled to be treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may be eligible to enroll in this study. 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid, a radiopharmaceutical ("tracer") will be injected by a urologist using transrectal ultrasound guidance (TRUS)at the UCSF Urology Clinic. Participants will then undergo SPECT/CT imaging at the UCSF Nuclear Medicine Clinic. This study will evaluate the feasibility of transporting patients to the Nuclear Medicine Clinic for imaging within 1-3 hours after administration of 99mTc-sulfur nanocolloid.
The Diagnosis of Oral Allergy Syndrome Through the Use of a Structured Questionnaire Oral allergy syndrome is a type of food allergy which mainly affects people with springtime hay fever. It is caused by a cross-reaction, between antibodies to pollens, usually birch tree pollen, and allergens in many different plant foods. It is characterised by symptoms of itching and/or swelling in the mouth and/or throat when eating certain fruits vegetables and nuts. Many of the allergens causing OAS are destroyed by heat, making allergy testing using traditional allergen extracts unreliable. Prick testing or challenging with fresh foods is more reliable, but time consuming, inconvenient and largely unavailable. Pilot study results suggest the characteristic symptoms and foods involved in OAS allow accurate diagnosis using clinical history alone, which forms the basis for the hypothesis of this proposal that OAS can be diagnosed accurately by use of a validated questionnaire alone. The diagnostic questionnaire (PFSDQ), revised from the results of the pilot study, will be tested against two reference test methods, the gold standard of oral food challenge, and the 'platinum standard' of diagnosis made by a medical expert based on history, skin prick testing and oral food challenge. This is not an epidemiological study but with no published studies on OAS in a UK population, this study will also provide some information on the prevalence of OAS in those with springtime hayfever in the UK.

Iron Metabolism Parameters At First Trimester and preGnancy outcomE Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia during pregnancy, which can still reach 10 to 20% of pregnant women in developed countries, with potentially serious consequences for the child. Systematic iron supplementation remains controversial.  This study aims to identify in the first trimester of pregnancy clinical and biological predictive factors for the occurrence of iron deficiency anemia in the third trimester of pregnancy.
Ultrasound Assessment of Gastric Content for Semi Emergency Surgery Aspiration of gastric content is a rare but serious complication of anesthesia. In this context, preoperative fasting for elective surgery is well defined. In an emergency situation, international guidelines recommend rapid sequence of anesthesia to reduce the risk of aspiration. In semi emergency situation, there is no consensus about the anesthetic procedure even if a preoperative fasting has been observed due to uncertainty of gastric emptying related to stress or painful condition. The choice of anesthesia induction technique depends mainly on the anesthetist. Ultrasonography is a non invasive bedside tool that can provide reliable quantitative information about the volume of gastric content.

Validation of Indirect Calorimetry in Children Undergoing Non-invasive Ventilation Nutritional status in critically ill pediatric patients is considered a fundamental prognostic factor in terms of mortality, morbidity, complications and outcome. Many studies report how predictive equations most commonly applied are inaccurate, therefore under or over estimating the body energy requirements. For this reason, actual measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) through indirect calorimetry (IC) is considered to be a better approach.  Currently, IC is not validated during the use of non-invasive ventilation.  Aim of the present study is to validate the measurement of REE with IC in pediatric patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation through a single-limb circuit with intentional leak.
AV Fistula Salvage in Advanced CKD Using Sodium Bicarbonate Prophylaxis This is an observational study assessing the impact of conventional dose iodinated contrast on the renal function of advanced chronic kidney disease patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula evaluation using a standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol. In addition, this model allows for pre and post procedure measurements of kidney function, providing a unique opportunity to assess the utility of novel biomarkers for contrast-induced kidney injury.  Our primary hypothesis is that there will be no change in serum creatinine post-procedure when using a standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol. Our secondary hypothesis is that there will be no change in urinary kidney-injury marker-1 (KIM-1) post-procedure using a standard sodium bicarbonate prophylaxis protocol. In addition, we will assess the impact of different patient characteristics on the development of contrast-induced kidney injury, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.

Effect Of Chronobıologıcal Nutrıtıon On Premature Babıes The aim of this study is to determine the effect of chronobiological nutrition approach on the growth and breastfeeding processes of premature babies. It will be carried out in a randomized controlled experimental design. In the study, it is planned to have 2 groups as experimental and control. As a result of the power analysis using the G Power 3.0.10 program, 90% power; A total of at least 78 samples were found to be sufficient in the study with a 5% margin of error (n1: 39; n2: 39). However, considering that the case could be lost, it was decided to increase it by 20% to 94 babies. Infants will be assigned to groups using a stratified sequential block randomization method. Premature babies will be stratified by week of gestation, birth weight and sex, and then an equal number of babies will be assigned to each group by blocking.  The appointment of premature infants will be decided by sequential block randomization.  After the descriptive information of the babies assigned to the groups is recorded in the questionnaire, the experimental group will be fed by applying the chronobiological nutrition approach. The control group will be fed without applying the chronobiological nutrition approach. The discharge times will be calculated for both groups.

Education vs Education Plus Intervention in HIV/HCV Diagnosis (DRIVE 03) Objectives: A targeted HIV testing strategy (TTS) through an HIV risk of exposure and indicator conditions (RE\&IC) questionnaire resulted in same rate of new HIV infection diagnosis (NHID), coverage and even reduced costs compared with a universal non targeted (Non TSS) HIV testing strategy in a prior study (DRIVE 01). To compare number of New HIV/HCV Infection Diagnoses (NHID HIV/HCV) and costs two HIV/HCV testing programs in the Primary Health Care: an educational and support only initiative to enhance HIV /HCV testing (EDSUP) or EDSUP plus a resourced external program (DRIVE 03).  Methodology: Prospective, randomized 1:1, clustered, crossover study, in one Health Care Area of Madrid, Spain, comparing the implementation of two HIV testing programs, EDSUP only vs. EDSUP plus DRIVE 03 program in 4 Primary Care Centers (PCC´s). People randomized to EDSUP plus DRIVE 03 program, non HIV infected, between 18-65 years, attending to any of the 4 PCC´s, not previously included in the study will be offered to participate. HIV testing program will be evaluated by measuring absolute number of new diagnosed infections (NDI) HIV/HCV and costs. Other outcomes considered will be people assigned and offered to participate, number of HIV tests performed, coverage (HIV /HCV tests/assigned population ratio), and rate of NDI HIV/HCV per ‰ tests performed. Six months prior to randomization main outcome variables will be recorded in the 4 PPC´s. Before randomization, EDSUP will be equally implemented in the 4 PCC´s. After randomization, first six months, DRIVE 03 program will be implemented in 2 PCC´s and in the other 2 observation of interest variables will be conducted. After first 6 month study period, PCC´s will be crossover to the opposite arm of randomization. DRIVE 03 program will offer rapid HIV tests, and testing staff to conduct all study procedures. For NDI HIV/HCV, molecular epidemiology, delayed diagnosis, retention in care, HIV/HCV treatment and control/eradication will be also monitored.
SOLIDARITY Finland Plus Long-COVID The SOLIDARITY PLUS Finland Long-COVID trial aims to assess the long-term effects of imatinib and infliximab, used during acute hospitalization due to COVID-19-infection, on long-COVID symptoms and quality of life (QoL) using questionnaires at six months, one and two years post-discharge. The primary research questions are whether imatinib or infliximab lower the risk of long-COVID symptoms and leads to better QoL in the long term.  Objectives include:  i) Long-COVID symptoms  To investigate the effect of imatinib (vs. usual care only) and infliximab (vs. usual care only) on the occurrence of symptoms that have been associated with the long-COVID syndrome. The questionnaires will take place at six months, one and two years after the hospital admission. The questionnaire will be the same that has been used in the SOLIDARITY Finland Long-COVID trial on remdesivir. The questionnaire was developed by our multidisciplinary team of physicians, including the representation of multiple specialties such as general practice, lung diseases, neurology, internal medicine, rheumatology, genetics, and clinical epidemiology, and two patient partners.  The symptom questionnaire - that will be completed by patients at one and two years - measures basic patient information (age, height, weight, smoking status, major comorbidity, and working status) and a wide variety of potential long-COVID-symptoms and their bother (1. Fatigue; 2. Attention deficits; 3. Memory problems; 4. Sleeping difficulties; 5. Depressive mood; 6. Anxiety; 7. Dizziness; 8. Headache; 9. Tinnitus; 10. Paresthesias; 11. Changes in taste/smell perceptions; 12. Postexertional malaise; 13. Palpitations; 14. Chest discomfort; 15. Nausea; 16. Skin rash; 17. Joint aches; 18. Muscle pains; 19. Continuous cough; 20. Respiratory tract mucous discharges).  ii) Quality of life  The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used to compare patients' quality of life in imatinib, infliximab, and usual care arms.  EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses the following domains: 1. Mobility; 2. Self-care; 3. Usual activities; 4. Pain and discomfort; 5. Anxiety and depression; 6. The visual analog scale of subjective perception of overall health.

Multi-Modality Imaging for Head & Neck Cancer Free Flap Design Assessment Surgical reconstruction of anatomical structures after head and neck cancer resection has made enormous strides in the past 20 years with advancing flap techniques and the usage of perforating vessels, but accurate and consistent identification of these perforators has remained a challenge due to the varying anatomy of vasculature in the donor region. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been used increasingly in preoperative free flap perforator mapping for breast reconstruction but has been limited in head and neck applications. In addition, indocyanine green (ICG) assisted NIR fluorescence angiography has been developed for intra-operative flap assessment. In this study, the investigators propose to assess a previously undocumented, multi-modal imaging technique with preoperative dual energy CTA to design and intraoperative ICG assisted NIR angiography to assess free flap in head and neck reconstruction.

Evaluation of "UroShield" Device Impact Upon Side Effects and Complications of Urinary Catheter Usage Evaluation of "UroShield" device impact upon side effects and complications of urinary catheter usage.  The use of urinary catheters is a common medical practice in the perioperative setting.  As such, it exposes the patient to certain comorbidities, including urinary tract infections.  The infectious process is known to begin with a development of a biofilm on the catheter's surface. This fact makes it an attractive target for UTI prevention technology.  Ultrasound waves were shown to reduce biofilm buildup in-vitro. We plan to determine the efficacy of this method in vivo.
The Sarcopenia Study The goal of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with Heart Failure. The main question it aims to answer is:  Whether there is a difference in the prevalence of sarcopenia across the spectrum of HFpEF (Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) and HFrEF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction).  This is an observational study. The participant population involves patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Healthy volunteers will be recruited as controls in addition to adults with asymptomatic Type 2 Diabetes.  Participants will undergo the following:  1. Skeletal muscle mass, quality and body composition assessments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) 2. Skeletal muscle strength assessments (Dynamometer, FysioMeter, handgrip strength) 3. Skeletal muscle energetics assessment (31p-Spectroscopy pre/post-exercise recovery)  Researchers will compare Heart failure groups with healthy controls and adults with asymptomatic type 2 Diabetes to see if there are significant differences in the strength, mass and quality of skeletal muscle.

All participants will receive a single dose of 25mg of psilocybin in a therapeutic setting. In order to investigate the effects of length of time on SSRI therapy, 30 participants with varying lengths of time on SSRI therapy will be enrolled, stratified into four groups:  * Group 1: ≤ 1 year * Group 2: 1 to ≤ 5 years * Group 3: 5 to ≤ 10 years * Group 4: \> 10 years
The Effect of IBD Flares on Serum PSA This study will measure Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) values in men with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) before, during, and following a flare. In addition, the effect of any PSA increase will be analyzed and correlated to the location of disease (rectal vs. other). Study findings may help men with IBD by identifying pitfalls in prostate cancer screening for this population and help to stratify and understand the effect IBD has on the prostatic milieu. By optimizing how men with IBD are screened for prostate cancer, future unnecessary healthcare encounters and expenditures may be reduced for this patient group.
Live Kidney Donors With Positive Anti-HCV Antibody, But Negative HCV PCR It is well recognized that a subset of patients who contracts Hepatitis C virus (HCV) spontaneously clears the virus. Such individuals are anti-HCV antibody positive, yet HCV RNA PCR negative in the blood. While they have not been considered candidates for live kidney donation in the past, with the recent availability of novel anti-HCV drugs with \>95% cure rates, they now represent a potential pool of donor candidates, especially since the risk for transmission of HCV to the recipient is extremely low. The investigators goal is to demonstrate that live kidney donation from anti-HCV positive, HCV RNA PCR negative individuals is safe and carries a negligible risk of viral transmission to the recipient.
Neuroscience Pain Education in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain The cognitive educational strategies such as neuroscience pain education, has been a popular and promising technique for treatment patients with chronic pain.

Amino Acid Metabolism in Fed Surgical Critically Ill Patients Introduction Sarcopenia is defined as progressive generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function. Sarcopenia due to lack of physical activity is a known phenomenon and is usually observed as a normal part of aging or in certain diseases and pathogenic processes. Major associated factors causing development of sarcopenia may be summarized as interactions of environmental and hormonal factors, underlying diseases, activation of inflammatory pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced satellite cell numbers, and loss of neuromuscular junctions.  Intensive care acquired weakness (ICU-AW) known formerly as critical illness polyneuropathy, is a diagnosis that becomes more common as survival rates from long ICU hospitalization are more prevalent. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration, without demyelination, that typically affects motor nerves more than sensory nerves.  ICU-AW affects the limbs (particularly the lower extremities) in a symmetric pattern. Weakness is most notable in proximal neuromuscular areas (e.g., the shoulders and hip girdle). In addition, involvement of the respiratory muscles can occur and can impede weaning from mechanical ventilation.  The pathophysiological mechanisms of ICU-acquired weakness are believed to be multifactorial. Some suspected factors include dysfunctional microcirculation and hyperglycemia. It has been shown that tight glucose control in ICU patients reduces the risk for ICU-AW (although it has been associated with other adverse events). Sodium channels channelopathy is also a researched cause for ICU-AW. Muscle loss in the ICU are usually related to bedridden condition and lack of mobility, increase in ubiquitination and inadequate protein administration associated with large negative nitrogen balance. In addition mechanical ventilation contributes greatly to this problem. This has been particularly relevant in post trauma/surgical long stayer patients.  In the past years great progress was made in the investigation of protein balance, breakdown and synthesis using stable isotope tracers in various medical conditions. In a research performed in PICU (1-5) and ICU (6, 7) regarding the measurement of plasma amino acid during critical illness, stable phenylalanine, tyrosine leucine, arginine and citrulline isotope were used intravenously without any safety issue problem. Another study was performed on adults suffering from COPD with matched healthy adults, using stable isotopes of phenylalanine, tyrosine leucine, isoleucine and valine (8). During the study the isotopes were given parenterally as well as enterally. The study showed significant change in splanchnic extraction of various amino acids and higher turnover of BCAA in COPD patients. Using the theory that supplemental milk can compensate for the elevated turnover of BCAA in COPD patients, using the isotope analysis demonstrated that this theory was proven wrong and the conclusion was that alterations are present in BCAA metabolism despite normal plasma levels in normal weight COPD. Further research is needed to find a way to compensate for it. These studies and other recent studies (9-19) show us the safety regarding the use of stable isotope tracers whether IV or PO, while giving us the opportunity to assess the metabolism of amino acid in all sorts of pathological states.  Hypothesis \& Aim of the study We think that based on current literature, there are important differences between critically ill patients and healthy population in the amino acid profile and distribution in the body as well as synthesis and breakdown.  The aim of the study is to measure these differences in long ICU stayers (above 7 days) admitted in the ICU after surgical/trauma injury, and to try and help aiming future treatment and research in this field.
Randomized Trial of Exercise and Social Interaction in a Community-Based Sample of Non-Demented Chinese Elders A pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted in a random sample of 120 non-demented Chinese elders (ages 60-79) living in a defined community in Shanghai, China to compare the effects of interventions (fast walking, Tai Chi, group intellectual discussion) to no intervention with respect to change in cognition and whole brain volume determined by repeated neuropsychological batteries and MRI scans. Aims included determining the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a random sample of people age 60+ for such a trial as well as collection of preliminary data on the efficacy of the interventions. The long-term goal of this research program is to determine whether sustained physical and/or mental exercise interventions are efficacious in delaying the onset of dementia and to understand the role and mechanisms of brain growth in this process.
Navigation and Parent Peer Support to Promote Access Nearly one in five children in the United States has a mental health problem that interferes with daily functioning and requires intervention, and yet less than 50% of children who need mental health care receive any services. Families and especially from low-income and ethnically diverse backgrounds, experience a range of barriers to engaging in services for their children including: lack of recognition of problems and knowledge of available treatments, connecting to services, trust in providers, stigma; low income and ethnically diverse populations are especially affected by these barriers. In this work, the investigators propose to carry out initial testing of a research- and theory-based model of Parent Peer Navigation services to help engage families with children with significant but pre-clinical problems in mental health services in order to prevent future poorer outcomes for children, who otherwise may never receive services, or only receive services when their mental health issues become severely debilitating for themselves and their family.
Study of the QUadratus Lumborum Bloc in Total Hip ARthroplasty: Efficacy and Safety The purpose of this prospective research study is to determine the best way to manage post-operative pain after a total hip arthroplasty. Currently, there is no standard of care for managing post-operative pain in these patients. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) first described by Blanco in 2007, is a promising technique in this indication: recently, there is a growing evidence for the use of the QLB as an alternative technique for pain management after hip surgery.

Drainage is Not Necessary Procedure After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Due to Severe Acute Cholecystitis Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the current preferred method of cholecystectomy. The role of routine drainage after LC to decrease postoperative morbidity is still an issue of considerable debate. The goal of this study was to assess to role of drains in LC, performed for acute inflamed gallbladder.
Widespread vs. Selective Screening for Hepatitis B Infection Prior to Chemotherapy This trial studies hepatitis B screening strategies of new cancer patients scheduled to undergo chemotherapy. Patients with cancer and hepatitis B virus infection are at risk of reactivation of infection after chemotherapy. Hepatitis B virus infection reactivation can be prevented by starting antivirals before chemotherapy in patients who are hepatitis B virus infection positive. Hepatitis B screening may help doctors prevent the reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection after chemotherapy.
ALCMI-005: Pembrolizumab and Epacadostat in Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and epacadostat work in combination treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may assist the immune system in recognizing cancer cells leading to elimination of those cells. Epacadostat may prevent down-regulation of T-cells, which means it can boost the immune system. Giving pembrolizumab and epacadostat together may work better than either drug alone in treating extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
Identification of New Colorectal Cancer Genes The purpose of this study is to define new genes for family risks of developing colon cancer.
Educational Intervention With Digital Technology For Family Caregivers Family caregivers of elderly stroke survivors face challenging difficulties such as the lack of support and the knowledge and skills to practice home care. The aim of this research is to compare the effect of an educational intervention for informal caregivers of elderly stroke survivors, in their capacity to care. A pragmatic randomized clinical trial, blinded for outcome assessment, will be conducted at a university hospital in the south of Brazil. Caregivers will be recruited and divided into two groups: intervention group and control group. The intervention will consist in a course in digital format developed by nurses to help the family caregiver of elderly people after a stroke to take care of their relative after hospital discharge. The control group will not receive the intervention. The primary outcome will be the caregivers' capacity to care. The study was submitted to the evaluation of the institution's ethics committee. All participants will signed the informed consent, which ensured voluntary and anonymous participation, as well as freedom to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice in the hospitalisation and in the relationship with the health team at the study site.

Prognostic Evaluation of Inflammatory Polyarthritis of Recent Onset Inflammatory joint diseases are major causes of invalidity and morbidity. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most frequent of chronic arthritides, affects close to 1% of the Canadian population. Direct and indirect costs of RA represent close to 1% of the gross national product. Recent evidence suggest that initiation of early (e.g., during the first 3-12 months of disease) aggressive treatment decreases both mortality and long term invalidity in RA and other chronic arthritides. However, a significant proportion of patients with early polyarthritis (EPA) have a benign evolution, even if they fulfill criteria for RA. On the contrary, most patients whose arthritis persist for more than 12 months have a progressive and destructive disease. Currently available clinical, serological and genetic markers of severity in arthritic patients perform poorly in EPA patients to identify those patients whose arthritis is likely to persist and thus who deserve an aggressive treatment.  The Investigators propose a prospective and longitudinal study to define the contribution of detection of rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoantibodies (RASA), either alone or in combination with other markers of severity, in the prognostic evaluation of patients presenting with EPA. Availability of such an effective serological tool to establish prognosis in individual patients would improve therapeutic decisions in clinical practice. The same prognostic tools would represent very powerful instruments to subset patients into more homogeneous groups in clinical trials, increasing their power.

Coronary Interventions Ulm - Coronary Chronic Total Occlusions The aim of the proposed project is to provide the long-term results after a recanalization attempt of chronically occluded coronary arteries.  To investigate recanalization attempt of chronically occluded coronary arteries at the Ulm University Hospital. As shown, it is known that successful recanalization of a chronic occlusion is associated with a lower event rate (reduced mortality and the need for operative myocardial revascularization) compared to unsuccessful recanalization (drug therapy). The standard in the therapy of successfully recanalized chronic occlusions is the use of drug-releasing vascular supports.
MEV to Block the Posterior and Lateral Cords of the Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus The investigators have recently shown that LSIB in combination with a suprascapular and a cervical plexus block is a very good alternative for arthroscopic shoulder surgery. However, the investigators believe the total volume of local anesthetic for LSIB may be reduced. For shoulder surgery there is no need to block the medial cord and the investigators therefore hypothesize a significantly lower MEV95% by applying a selective lateral and posterior cord block

Objective: To establish the reference intervals of complete blood count parameters and Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen.  Study design: This is a cross-sectional study.  Study population: Pregnant women with no history of disease and normal clinical findings.
Metabolic Flexibility, Gut Microbiota, Healthy Diet and Exercise in NAFLD on Genetics Base Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated to obesity, metabolic syndrome and genetic predisposition: specific variants of the genes PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 are the most involved. Also biochemical mechanisms that affect the "metabolic flexibility" need to be better clarified.  It is known that a dietary intervention, accompanied by a physical personalized training, reduce either the hepatic fat content either insulin resistance.  Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate "metabolic flexibility" in obese NAFLD subjects taking in account the presence or absence of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphism and the histopathological diagnosis of either simple steatosis or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The composition of gut microbiota will be also evaluated.  Finally, two distinct healthy dietary profiles accompanied by a personalized physical training, will be tested to comprehend whether and how "healthy diets" could operate in the clinical treatment of NAFLD and related conditions.
Adapted Physical Activity, Health-related Quality of Life and Satisfaction With Care in Hospitalized Children The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of adapted physical activity intervention on health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care in hospitalized children and adolescents.  This is a randomized controlled study.

The Effect of Proactive Clinical Ethics Consultations on End-of-life Care of the Critically Ill in the Intensive Care Settings Study objective: This study is planning to explore factors predicting the use of life-sustaining treatment, develop the screening criteria of proactive clinical ethics consultations, the effect of proactive clinical ethics consultations and interprofessional practice on end-of-life care of the critically ill in the intensive care settings, and develop the competency for trainees by interprofessional education.  Methods: Data will be collected prospectively. Data between January 2013 and April 2014 was collected from hospital electronic record and ethics consultation document. All data will be analyzed for patients dying in the intensive care settings during the first stage of the study. Factors predicting the use of life-sustaining treatment will be determined. The Delphi technique will be applied to secure a consensus among the panel of experts chosen to help develop the screening criteria of proactive ethics consultations. A prospective randomized controlled trial will be conducted during the second stage of the study on a convenience sample of adult critical ill patients in the intensive care settings. Patients will randomize to the intervention group receive proactive ethics consultations. The control group will undergo routine intensive care, receiving clinical ethics consultations as requested by healthcare team, patients or family. All participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire rating their satisfaction with the healthcare process and consultations if conducted. Mean length of stay and the duration of the use of life-sustaining treatment will be compared between two groups. Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of satisfied families and healthcare team members. The interprofessional education with the core curriculum and case scenario for simulation will be developed, implement, and evaluated.
Timing of Umbilical Cord Clamping: One to Three Minutes vs. After Cessation of Cord Pulsation The timing of umbilical cord clamping has been widely discussed in the scientific community.  As part of the worldwide strategies to reduce childhood iron deficiency anemia, the incorporation of late clamping (at least one minute after delivery), has been adopted as an effective and low-cost measure for health services.  The optimal timing for clamping, ( if until 3 minutes of delivery, or later, when the cord stops spontaneous pulse), still remains controversial.  Also, doubts remain about the effect of late clamping of the umbilical cord on maternal outcomes.  This study has the hypothesis that waiting for the cessation of the cord pulsation will not bring harm to the newborn or the mother.
Opportunities and Limits to Deprescribing in Nursing Homes:Quality Circle Deprescribing Module Older people residing in nursing homes (NH) are frequently polymedicated and often prescribed potentially inappropriate medications.

Practice Guidelines Grading Systems Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. They are developed to give a recommendation based on the best evidence available. Through a randomized trial, the investigators intend to provide information about which of the four grading systems most used today to grade evidence and recommendations in CPGs, could change physician´s behavior towards a common clinical situation in daily practice.
Smartphone-based Cognitive Emotion Regulation Training for Unpaid Primary Caregivers of Persons With Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) not only exact a heavy toll on patients, they also impose an enormous emotional, physical, and financial burden on unpaid, often family, caregivers. The strain of providing care for a loved one diagnosed with AD, often across several years, is associated with elevated depression risk and poorer overall health. Emotion regulation skills represent an ideal target for psychological intervention to promote healthy coping in ADRD caregivers. The project seeks to use an experimental medicine approach to test the efficacy and biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, relatively brief, targeted, scalable, smartphone-based cognitive emotion regulation intervention aimed at improving psychological outcomes (i.e., reducing perceived stress, caregiver burden, and depressive symptoms) in ADRD unpaid primary caregivers as well as examine potential benefits of the caregiver intervention on quality of life in care recipients. Cognitive reappraisal is the ability to modify the trajectory of an emotional response by thinking about and appraising emotional information in an alternative, more adaptive way. Reappraisal can be operationalized via two primary tactics: psychological distancing (i.e. appraising an emotional stimulus as an objective, impartial observer) and reinterpretation (i.e., imagining a better outcome than what initially seemed apparent). The project will investigate the efficacy and underlying biobehavioral mechanisms of a novel, one-week cognitive reappraisal intervention in this population, with follow-up assessments at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. ADRD unpaid primary caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive training in either distancing, reinterpretation, or a no regulation natural history control condition, with ecological momentary assessments of self-reported positive and negative affect, remotely- collected psychophysiological health-related biomarkers (i.e., heart rate variability data) using pre-mailed Polar H10 chest bands, and health-related questionnaire reports. Distancing training is expected to result in longitudinal reductions in self-reported negative affect, longitudinal increases in positive affect, and longitudinal increases in HRV that are larger than those attributable to reinterpretation training and no-regulation control training.
Arterial Stiffness and Complication Risk in Type 2 Diabetes Background  The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing globally. A common complication of diabetes is the disease of the blood vessels, vascular diseases, which can cause disorders like myocardial infarction, stroke and kidney failure. Methods to detect early subclinical stages of macro-vascular disease are not yet available in a clinical setting.  Hypothesis  Arterial stiffness, an easy accessible vascular parameter, may provide additional prognostic information when evaluating risk profile for patients with diabetes type 2.  Aim  The aim of the project is to investigate the association between arterial stiffness and the occurrence and development of vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. Specifically we want to investigate:  1. in a cross-sectional study, the association between arterial stiffness and subclinical atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries assessed by computed tomography (CT) and 2. in a longitudinal study, the predictive value of arterial stiffness on the development of subclinical cerebrovascular changes assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nephropathy assessed by urine analysis.  Methods  The study population consists of 100 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 100 age- and sex matched controls. The study participants were enrolled between 2008-2011 and extensively characterized i.a. with arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), MRI (white matter lesions and cerebral infarctions) and urine analysis (albuminuria). In this study we will enrol the same patients in a 5 year follow-up study in order to repeat above mentioned measurements. Furthermore, CT is used to investigate the coronary plaque burden of the participants (Agatston Score and Segment Involvement Score).  Results and Perspective  This project adds new insight into arterial stiffness as a predictor of the progression of micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes, and can potentially improve risk stratification and early strategies of intervention in this patient group.

Dextromethorphan Versus Placebo for Neuropathic Pain In our current clinical trial, we are comparing the effects of two NMDA receptor antagonists to placebo in patients with painful distal symmetrical diabetic neuropathy or post-herpetic neuralgia. The treatments in this three-period crossover study are dextromethorphan, up to 920 mg/day (about 8 times the antitussive dose), memantine, 30-50 mg/day, and placebo. Memantine is an NMDA antagonist used in Europe to treat Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The underlying hypothesis, based on studies of painful neuropathies in animal models, is that neuropathic pain is caused largely by sensitization of central nervous system neurons caused by excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, acting largely through NMDA receptors. A previous small trial of dextromethorphan suggested efficacy in diabetic neuropathy pain. The study requires one visit to the NIH outpatient Pain Research Clinic, and consists of three 9-week treatment periods. Patients who respond to one of the medications will be invited to participate in further controlled studies of the medication followed by up to several years of open-label treatment under continued observation.
Study of Metabolites Markers in Adjuvant Breast Cancer The breast cancer is composed of multiple biological entities. Recent progress in molecular biology, DNA or RNA chip, permitted the global tumour genome or transcriptome study. Those technics, leads to an increased in the molecular biology knowledge and a better oncogenesis understanding. Breast cancer taxonomy was established following the tumor genetic profile. Moreover this classification is incomplete and didn't include the metabolic pathways other than hormonal or HER2 pathways.  The metabolomics is an expanding field of research exploring the metabolites in cells, tissues or biologics fluids. It allows assessing the variation activation of the different cellular metabolic pathways. In oncology, it could highlight the main metabolic disturbances, the interaction of tumor cells and to identify the metabolic pathways involved in oncogenesis using the tumor cells metabolites profiles.  Compared to genomic, the metabolomics integrated the impact of the cells environments on the cells biology. The cells environment plays, in fact, a key role in the oncogenesis and in the tumor cells phenotypes. The metabolomics, thus being a complementary approach of the genomic in order to assess a better knowledge of the impact of the extracellular environment on the tumor cell phenotype. In addition, the metabolomics analyses are fast and not expensive compatible with routine practice.  The main objective of this study is to highlight a metabolic alteration specific to certain tumors phenotypes in order to have better understanding of the biology of the numerous breast cancer entities and find some biomarkers which could be some possible therapeutic target. Using a high resolution mass spectrometer, the investigators will analyze 52 tumor samples from frozen breast surgical specimen preserved in the Centre Antoine lacassagne tumor bank. The tissue analysis could be associated with a serum sample analysis from the frozen serum bank of the Centre Antoine Lacassagne. With 30 patients who performed a 18 FDG-PET before the surgery, The investigators will analyzed the correlation between the tumoral activation of the glycolysis pathways, quantified with mass spectroscopy and the 18FDG uptake. Using the 17 frozen serums available, the investigators will perform a screening to identify some metabolites or metabolites profile which could be detected in the serum in order to develop a new liquid biopsy approach. This study is a retrospective study based on data and sample already available in the center and collected during the routine practice.

Therapeutic Zinc in Infant Bacterial Illness Infections are the important cause of high mortality in young infants in developing countries. Zinc is a crucial micronutrient as it influences various immune mechanisms and modulates host resistance to several pathogens. It has shown benefits as an adjunct therapy in infections like diarrhea and pneumonia in older children Given the predisposition of young infants in developing countries to zinc deficiency and infections, addition of zinc to standard treatment of serious bacterial infections may lead to significant improvements in the outcomes.  Several hypotheses will be examined in this clinical trial. The primary objective is to measure, in a double blind randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of giving 2 RDA (Required Daily Allowance 10 mg) of zinc orally in addition to routine antibiotics, for treatment of possible serious bacterial infection in infants \>= 7 days and up to 4 months of age in reducing the proportion of treatment failures and time to discharge from the hospital. This will evaluate the clinical consequences of the possible immunomodulation by zinc supplementation. This is critical to demonstrate because nearly 80% of infant mortality occurs in first months of life.  Young infants with possible serious bacterial infections fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and stratified into 4 groups on basis of weight for age 'z' scores \< -2 z and \>=- 2 z and whether he/she has diarrhea or not. Within each stratum the subjects will be randomized to receive zinc or placebo. Treatment failures will be defined by the need for a change of initial antibiotic therapy. The minimum duration of monitoring will be till clinical recovery (using predetermined criteria). Serum copper, serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptors will be determined at enrollment, 72 hours after enrollment and at discharge from the hospital. Concentrations of CRP and procalcitonin will be measured at baseline, 72 hours after enrolment and at clinical recovery.  Documentation of efficacy of addition of zinc to standard therapy may provide a simple and low-cost strategy to improve survival in serious infections in young infants. This is likely to have a significant impact on infant morbidity and mortality. It will be good example of using a simple immunomodulator beneficially in improving child health.
The Use of a Restrictive Fluid Regimen With Hypertonic Saline for Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenectomy The Whipple operation is a complex surgical procedure involving the removal of the head of the pancreas, bile duct, and a portion of the intestine (duodenum) that is performed for patients who have cancer or some other condition affecting this region of the body. The Whipple operation is associated with a significant complication rate. Previous studies have shown that in a broad range of surgical procedures, using a reduced amount of intravenous fluids along with a special type of fluid called hypertonic saline during and after the procedure can lower complication rates associated with the heart and lungs during recovery from surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine if using a reduced amount of intravenous fluids as well as hypertonic saline (a salt concentrated form of intravenous fluids) during the Whipple operation and in the immediate period after surgery can reduce complications.

Target Sign vs Palpation for Radial Arterial Line Placement Invasive blood pressure monitoring is achieved by cannulating an artery and transducing the pressure. During arterial cannulation the artery can be located by palpation, but use of ultrasound has increased the success rate of cannulation. A new ultrasound technique for vascular cannulation (dynamic needle tip positioning) has been described. Investigators aim to compare this technique to the palpation technique for arterial cannulation. Investigators hypothesize that the use of this novel ultrasound technique will result in a higher first attempt success rate and overall success compared to palpation.  Investigators plan to enroll 310 patients in this study. The participants in the study will have been deemed by the attending anesthesiologist to require a radial arterial line for the operation and thus the research protocol will not involve a deviation from the standard of care.

Nutritional Intervention in Hip Fracture Patients Hip fractures are highly prevalent and are expected to increase due to the ageing population. Malnutrition is often present in these patients and is associated with prolonged convalescence, lower mobility, lower mental function, lower quality of life and higher complication rate. Nutritional intervention starting soon after hospital admission might reduce complication rate and total length-of-stay by improving nutritional and functional status. Research questions are:  1. Does nutritional intervention reduce total length-of-stay? 2. Is nutritional intervention cost-effective? 3. Can nutritional screening contribute to targeting of nutritional intervention, and thereby reduce costs without loss of effectiveness?  Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive oral nutritional supplements (protein and energy enriched) and regular dietetic counselling during hospitalisation and after discharge at patients' homes for 3 months. Patients in the control group will receive usual nurse and dietetic care. Outcome measurements will be taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after inclusion.
Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation For The Treatment of Diabetic Neuropathy Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is the most common complication of diabetes, affecting almost 50% of people with diabetes over the course of their lives. Symptoms vary from numbness to burning, aching and hypersensitivity in the lower limbs, indicative of sensory nerve loss. Motor neurons can also be affected, leading to muscle weakness and mobility issues, thus preventing patients from engaging in daily routines. Further sequelae include foot ulceration and Charcot neuroarthropathy, which are risk factors for lower limb amputation and mortality. In the United Kingdom, the annual costs of DN alone exceed £300 million, with further complications expected to cost an additional £1 billion. Currently, management strategies for DN focus on prevention and pain management. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a novel nonpharmacological intervention for people with DN. NMES is the application of electrical impulses which are of sufficiency intensity to improve artificial contraction of the muscle tissue and may help with DN by improving nerve conductivity through direct stimulation of the nerves.
Study of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Severe COVID-19 The novel coronavirus pneumonia is a kind of new emerging respiratory infectious disease, characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest tightness, and caused by the infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In severe cases, there will be rapid respiratory system failure. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is extremely contagious and the disease progresses rapidly. It has become a urgent and serious public health event that threatens human life and health globally. Among them, severe pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus is characterized by extensive acute inflammation of the lungs and the patient is critically ill. At present, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.Most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
Multicomponent Intervention to Decrease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-Related Hospitalizations The investigators' proposed study is a randomized controlled trial that will prospectively examine the effect of a multicomponent intervention on the rate of hospitalizations, daily physical activity, self efficacy and health status in patients who have COPD and have been hospitalized because of a COPD exacerbation.  In the study, a convenience sample of patients recently hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation, who meet the selection criteria and agree to participate will be randomized to receive one of the following at the time of hospital discharge: (1) the current standard of care plus a multicomponent intervention (counselor + pulmonary rehabilitation) or (2) the current standard of care without the intervention.  This study plans to test the following hypotheses: (1) The primary outcome of the study to be the composite endpoint of death or COPD hospitalization (2) Time to first rehospitalization will be shorter in the intervention group than the control group (3) At follow-up, the physical activity level measured in terms of the average number of steps and active energy expenditure will be higher in the intervention group than in the control group.
A Clinical Trial to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of an Inactivated Vaccine (Vero Cell) Against EV71 in Chinese Children Aged 6-35 Months Since its discovery in 1969, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been recognised as a frequent cause of epidemics of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) associated with severe neurological sequelae in a small proportion of cases. There has been a significant increase in EV71 epidemic activity throughout the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Recent HFMD epidemics in this region have heen associated with a severe from of brainstem encephalitis associated with pulmonary oedema and high case-fatality rates.  The data from the phase 1 and 2 trials suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese children and infants. According to the immunogenicity and safety results, the 320U with adjuvant with immunizing schedule of two doses (per 28 day) will be applied in phase 3 clinical trial.

Vinorelbine and Bevacizumab in Treating Older Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving vinorelbine together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.  PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vinorelbine together with bevacizumab works in treating older patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

Clinical Study of the Presence of Trichomonas Tenax and Entamoeba Gingivalis in Patients With Periodontitis The buccal cavity presents microorganismes whose the number and composition vary with oral hygiene and medical context (pathologies and associated drug therapies) of the patient. More than 1200 bacterial species have been identified, and among them, 400 are inhabitants of the sub-gingival biofilm. Among all these microorganismes, only 20 species participate to the etiopathogenesis of periodontal diseases.Some are recognised as major periodontopathogens other play unclear role in this pathology. They belong respectively to the red and orange complex of Socransky et al. (1998).  Other microorganismes such as virures, yeasts and protozoans could potentially impact the emergence and development of periodontal diseases. The presence of protozoans in periodontitis have been investigated in this study.

3D Camera - Telemedical Foot Ulcer Treatment Diabetic foot ulcers are deep wounds that occur as a result of nerve damage in the feet (peripheral neuropathy). Amputation is a common consequence of diabetic foot ulcers; approximately 85% of all diabetes-related amputations are caused by foot ulcers. The ulcer treatment is extensive, resource demanding and highly specialized and necessitates involvement of patient, hospital and local in-home care personnel.  The 3D photo optic camera project aims at a much more efficient and precise method for diagnosis and treatment of foot ulcers. The Department of Endocrinology and the section for LEAN and Innovation at Odense University Hospital has developed a prototype for a 3D camera that takes pictures and measurements of the ulcer that can provide the basis for correct diagnosis and treatment of the ulcer. The camera was developed in close cooperation with TECCLUSTER A/S, Svendborg Municipality, Team Online and ComMed.

The Effect of Energy Drink Ingredients on Cardiovascular Function in Men and Women 18-39 Years Old 1. Statement of the research question:     Does the caffeine in energy drinks interact with other ingredients to affect cardiovascular function in healthy male and female adults after exercise? 2. Purpose and significance of the study:  Energy drinks are beverages promoted to enhance alertness along with athletic and cognitive performance. The most common ingredients found in energy drinks include water, sugar, caffeine, taurine, and B-vitamins, with variable inclusion of other ingredients, such as carnitine, glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana, ginkgo biloba leaf extract, thistle extract, and ginseng root extract. Since the mid-1990s, the consumption of energy drinks has grown dramatically, with worldwide sales in 2017 exceeding $49 billion.  As the sale of energy drinks has grown, so has the number of adverse event case reports for patients who consumed energy drinks. Reported symptoms included cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac arrest. A few small clinical studies have found that energy drinks can increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure and change electrical activity in the heart as measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG). The intent of the proposed study is to determine whether caffeine or the combination of caffeine with taurine and L-carnitine can alter cardiovascular function. Hypothesis: The effects of the ingredients of energy drinks on the heart are mediated in part by interactions between caffeine, taurine and carnitine. The amount of each ingredient in the study was based upon the amount commonly contained in two cans of energy drinks currently on the market.

Comparative Efficacy and Safety Study of Dolutegravir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir in Second-line Treatment For treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), publicly funded programmes tend to follow World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to use a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART); however, there is a need for further data on the best treatment options for people with HIV-1 who have virological failure with this first-line regimen. The number of patients failing on their first-line regimen is increasing thereby requiring a switch to second-line treatment to reduce accumulation of drug-resistance mutations, disease progression, HIV transmission, and death. WHO guidelines recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy for adults consisting of two NRTIs + a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI); atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir (LPV)/RTV are the preferred boosted PI options. This study is conducted to demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity at 48 weeks of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen compared to a WHO-recommended standard of care regimen for second line treatment, LPV/RTV + two NRTIs, in HIV-1 infected patients failing first line therapy. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (approximately 28 to 42 days), a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48 plus a 4-week treatment extension), and a Continuation Phase. Approximately 612 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 milligram (mg) once daily or LPV/RTV (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily, in accordance with investigator decision and local label), each added to an investigator selected background regimen of two NRTIs at least one of which needs to be fully active based on viral resistance testing at Screening. Subjects randomized to the LPV/RTV arm will either (i) continue receiving LPV/RTV and complete the study after the 4-week treatment extension at Week 52, or (ii) switch to the DTG arm prior to study completion at Week 52 and continue to have access to DTG in the Continuation Phase. Subjects randomized to receive DTG who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment and subjects originally randomized to receive LPV/RTV but switched to DTG prior to Week 52 will continue to have access to DTG until it is either locally approved and commercial supplies are available to patients or the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, or the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation.

Clinical Study of Hydroxytyrosol (HT) in Mitochondrial Diseases Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are the commonest group of inborn errors resulting from primary dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC). High phenolics-containing extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) can be one of the potential dietary supplements for the treatment of MD. Previous reports demonstrated that phenolics including oleuropein, oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol found in EVOO have strong antioxidant properties against the oxidative stress in brain tissue and showed a protective effect on mitochondria by restoring mitochondrial enzymatic activities.  This proposed study is an open-label pilot/ feasibility clinical trial using hydroxytyrosol (HT) as dietary supplements in a cohort of 12 MD patients recruited from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital (HKCH).  The objective is to explore the longitudinal effect of receiving hydroxytyrosol (HT) as dietary supplements over a 12-month period and the change on a 6-month period after withdrawal. The applicability of the outcome measures will be evaluated in the current trial for future clinical studies and obtain relevant data for the next phase of the clinical trial on hydroxytyrosol (HT) efficacy. Besides, the tolerability of hydroxytyrosol (HT) in MD patients will be evaluated.  The primary outcome measure is the functional assessment of the patient's clinical outcomes by International Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Score (IPMDS). Secondary outcome measures included the measurement of biochemical and radiological parameters. Besides, tolerability and quality of life of the subjects will be determined.  Relevant data including the feasibility of subject recruitment, withdrawal rate, feasibility of data collection of outcome measures, longitudinal effect of hydroxytyrosol (HT) on the outcome measures in the trial can be collected and analysed in this pilot study providing important information for the future clinical trials. The ultimate goal is to develop effective therapies to lower mortality, improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life in MD patients.

Effectiveness of H1N1 Influenza Vaccines in Manitoba, Canada Excellent immune responses following 1 or 2 doses of the GSK monovalent AS03-adjuvanted pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) vaccines (e.g., Arepanrix®) have been documented in several trials. Observational studies have found that these vaccines were effective in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza infections. However, it remains unclear whether vaccination during the pandemic was associated with reductions in more clinically meaningful outcomes, such as hospitalizations, severe illness, complications, and death.  The investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of the GSK adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted pH1N1 vaccines used in Manitoba in preventing hospitalization and severe illness (defined as illness necessitating admission to intensive care or associated with major complications) due to influenza or pneumonia by means of a case-control study using data from Manitoba Health (MH) administrative databases and the database of the Cadham Provincial Laboratory. The primary outcome will be hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza or pneumonia. A secondary outcome will be hospitalization with influenza or pneumonia. The investigators will also assess the effectiveness of the above vaccines for different age groups and among high-risk populations, e.g., immunocompromised individuals.

A Study Evaluating Bacillus Cereus in the Prevention of Afatinib-associated Diarrhea Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB-family blocker with approved clinical activity in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations. It has received regulatory approval for use as a treatment for patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose tumors harbour activating EGFR mutations within exons 18-21 of the EGFR receptor, or patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma whose disease progress after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. However, diarrhea is the most commonly reported adverse events associated with afatinib treatment (\> 90%). Although these events are generally mild to moderate in severity, diarrhea adversely affects the tolerability of cancer treatment, and in severe cases diarrhea has the potential to affect the efficacy of treatment due to poor compliance, or treatment interruption, or dosage reduction. Currently, no prophylactic measure was demonstrated efficaciously. Bacillus cereus is an aerobic spore-forming bacterium that is commonly found in soil. The efficacy of Bacillus cereus in the management of afatinib treatment-associated diarrhoea has not been extensively evaluated in clinical studies. This is a single-arm, single-institutional, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Bacillus cereus (Changfukang®) in the prevention of afatinib-associated diarrhea in NSCLC patients.

The Cerebral-Respiratory Interaction in Controlled Mechanically Ventilated Neurosurgical Patients. (The CeRes-CMV Study) The impact of mechanical ventilation on intracranial perfusion is still not completely clarified. It is often assumed that raising airway pressure will invariably elevate the intracranial pressure, but this is not always the case.  The effects of airway pressure on intracranial pressure can depend on several factors, and among others, an uncontrolled expiration and consequent lung collapse may have an influence on cerebral perfusion.  This study will investigate the incidence and the consequences of an uncontrolled expiration and expiratory lung collapse in critically ill neurosurgical patients during controlled mechanical ventilation.  Electrical impedance tomography measurements , oesophagus and gastric pressure, electrical activity of the diaphragm and intracranial pressure will be acquired in a synchronised manner during controlled mechanical ventilation. Moreover, airway opening pressure, expiratory flow limitation and recruitment/inflation ratio will be determined during controlled mechanical ventilation, on a daily bases until the patient recover his/her own spontaneous breathing.

Effect of Early Eating on Body Composition To our knowledge, as of this day there are only four studies which examined the effects of eTRE with a duration of 12 weeks. There are no studies that examined this phenomenon beyond 12 weeks, one study that lasted five weeks and four studies that lasted 4 weeks or less, some even days. The four studies that lasted 12 weeks in duration all have opportunities to improve upon, which will be discussed here. The first study performed by Gabel et al., focused primarily on measuring body weight, not body composition in older adults. The eating window also began later in the morning at 1000h and finished at 1800h. There also was no restriction on participants consuming caffeine during the fasting window. The second study conducted by Gasmi et al., was focused on strictly older male participants that were active and healthy, again, without measuring body composition. The third study conducted by Wilkinson et al., did not measure body composition and the eating window lasted 10 hours instead of 8. The fourth study performed by Chow et al., examined eTRE with adults aged 45+/-12 years old and did not mention any exclusion criteria based upon physical activity levels or restrictions on caffeine/artificial sweetener intake during the fasting window. Furthermore, none of the studies mentioned above examined eTRE against lTRE directly. We believe that the proposed study will address the concerns mentioned previously and further knowledge associated with eTRE.

Prevention of Post-spinal Anesthesia Hypotension in Caesarean Delivery Using Delayed Supine Positioning Maternal hypotension is a common complication after spinal anaesthesia for caesarean delivery. Prophylaxis against post-spinal hypotension (PSH) during caesarean delivery would prevent serious maternal and fetal complications. Various methods had been investigated for prophylaxis against maternal hypotension. The basic components of management of PSH are: 1. Fluid loading. 2. Pharmacological agents. 3. Positioning protocols. Although Fluid loading is superior to non-loading protocols during caesarean delivery, the incidence of Post-spinal hypotension is high with all fluid loading protocols. Thus; the value of fluid loading in caesarean delivery could not be used solely for prevention of PSH. Using vasopressors for prophylaxis against PSH is nearly fundamental during caesarean delivery. However, vasopressors are not devoid of side effects such as reflex bradycardia after phenylephrine and fetal acidosis after ephedrine. Thus, combining vasopressor prophylaxis and non-pharmacological protocols would help to decrease the dose of vasopressors, and consequently decreasing their side effects. Ondansetron had been also reported as a useful prophylactic drug from PSH with minimal side effects. Positioning protocols, such as operating table tilting or flexing, the use of wedges or mechanical displacers, leg wrapping or sequential compression devices, head down and head up positioning aim to reversing aortocaval compression and/or increasing venous return. The sitting position for a short period after spinal block in order to slow the onset of the spinal block. Keeping the patient in the sitting position after spinal block would also prevent extension of local anaesthetic solution to upper thoracic dermatomes which is an important factor in preventing maternal hypotension.  no previous reports had evaluated the impact of sitting position within the context of a multimodal protocol for prophylaxis against maternal hypotension. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of 2-minute sitting position after spinal anesthesia on maternal hemodynamics when combined with prophylactic norepinephrine infusion plus preoperative bolus of ondansetron. We aim to reach the best possible maternal hemodynamic profile in addition to maintenance of adequate block level.
Metabolic Effects of Almond in the Longer-term Study Identifying snacks that do not contribute to positive energy balance is crucial in weight management. The satiating effects of almonds, coupled with their convenience and palatability make them a promising weight management aid. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of almond consumption with meals versus snacks on outcomes such as appetite, energy intake, body weight, as well as blood glucose, insulin and lipid responses.
Resveratrol Supplementation on Exercise in Healthy Sedentary Adults Previous animal studies have found that resveratrol supplementation significantly increased aerobic capacity. The investigators conducted a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study to assess whether resveratrol could provide similar benefits in humans.  All participants were assigned to two 4-week treatment periods, with a 2 week washout in-between. During one period, volunteers in received resveratrol and during the other period, they received identical-appearing placebo.  The primary outcome of interest was change in exercise capacity, as measured by change in exercise duration on constant load exercise testing and change in aerobic capacity (peak VO2) on incremental exercise testing. Secondary outcomes were tolerability and side-effects associated with resveratrol.

The goal of this research project is to improve services and outcomes for children with early signs of ASD by testing the effectiveness of a brief, inexpensive training on EI providers' ability to deliver an evidence-based, caregiver-mediated intervention that can improve providers' comfort and effectiveness in working with families of children with social communication concerns, as well as improving child and family outcomes.
Evaluation of Optical Pumping Magnetometer Sensors for MagnetoEncephaloGraphy Imaging This research is a feasibility study on a new generation of brain magnetic activity sensor which should allow the development of this modality, until now limited by its cost to a few large university centers.  The measurement of magnetic activity allows the detection and localization of abnormal activities such as paroxysmal events occurring between seizures in patients with epilepsy as well as research into brain function. It is the only one, along with EEG and related techniques, to provide data related to the speed of the brain. MEG, by virtue of the properties of magnetic fields, has a greater potential than EEG for the detection and localization of the neuronal sources which cause it.  The MEG sensors used until now use Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID) components that are extremely sensitive but require complex instrumentation and only operate under superconducting conditions, resulting in prohibitive maintenance and cost.  The alternative could come from a new magnetic activity sensor: the optical pumping magnetometers of the alkaline type.  This preliminary study proposes to compare SQUID sensors with MPO He4 sensors for their ability to detect abnormal activities recorded in epileptic patients. Measurements that cannot be recorded simultaneously Two types of measurement will be compared with the reference that constitutes in-depth recording (Stereotactic-EEG or SEEG) used to precisely define the region of the brain to be resected in order to cure epileptic patients of their seizures.  The expected results are a capacity of this type of sensors to detect epileptic activities equivalent to that of SQUIDs.

Effect of Deferoxamine on Wound Healing Rate in Patients With Diabetes Foot Ulcers Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most invalidating complication of diabetes and represents a big economic burden for the society. No specific therapy is available for diabetic foot ulcers.The aim of this study is to define a new approach for treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. Our concept is based on the improvement of the cellular reaction to hypoxia. It will address the transcriptional factor HIF-1 (Hypoxia inducible factor-1) which is the cellular sensor for oxygen and which is specifically repressed by hyperglycemia. The study will investigate the effect of local deferoxamine (0.66 mg/ml), the only known HIF-1 inducer, on the wound healing rate in patients with neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. The primary objective of the study will be the reduction with \>50% of the wound area after 12 weeks of treatment.

The Effectiveness of Mindfulness on Chronic Pain in Breast Cancer Survivors A recent epidemiologic survey has indicated that approx. 42% of Danish women treated for breast cancer experience negative sequelae in the form of pain following treatment. Chronic pain is known to be associated with impaired social and emotional functioning, and thus presents a particular concern.  Mindfulness-based intervention is among the complementary, psychological treatments, which cancer patients commonly seek out in relation to the course of their illness. Despite the popularity of mindfulness-based intervention among cancer patients, no studies have so far investigated the effect of mindfulness-based intervention on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. While no studies so far have focused on pain, there is evidence to suggest that mindfulness-based intervention is associated with improved psychosocial adaption to cancer. Furthermore, non-cancer research suggests that mindfulness-based intervention is associated with reduced pain experiences.  The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on chronic pain in breast cancer patients. Women who have completed their treatment for breast cancer and who experience chronic pain, will be randomized to an intervention group (MBCT) or a treatment-as-usual control group. All participants will be assessed at the same time points, i.e. before the intervention (baseline), and three times after the intervention/control condition, with the last follow-up 6 months after the intervention. In addition, a number of potential moderators and mediators of the outcome will be explored. For example, recent studies indicate that adult attachment style may constitute an important moderator and/or mediator in the development of pain, and preliminary research has suggested that attachment style may moderate the effect of mindfulness-based intervention.  The results will provide valuable new knowledge about the potential of MBCT as a treatment strategy for chronic pain in breast cancer patients, will contribute to the clarification of underlying mechanisms in the experience of and coping with pain, which could help the development of more effective, individualized interventions.
Chromatic Pupillometry to Assess the Melanopsin-Light Pathway in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy The specific aim of this study is to investigate rod, cone and melanopsin driven pupillary light response in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), age-matched healthy controls and individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases using chromatic pupillometry, with special interest in assessing melanopsin-driven post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) as an identifier for PSP.  The study addresses the following hypotheses:  1. Chromatic pupil responses, including rod/cone-driven rapid phase constriction and melanopsin-driven PIPR, are reduced in subjects with PSP compared to age-matched normal healthy control subjects, 2. Pupil parameters of the melanopsin-driven PIPR are abnormal in PSP subjects without supranuclear palsy, which is indicative of a subclinical physiological deficit of the OPN in the early stages of PSP.  If these hypotheses are upheld, chromatic pupillometry to measure the PIPR promises to be a reliable in vivo, non-invasive, convenient and inexpensive technique to detect asymptomatic pupillomotor impairment in advance of diagnostic oculomotor signs and deterioration of cognitive function.

Intervention to Assist MSM Disclose HIV Status to Casual Sex Partners Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain disproportionately represented in the national HIV/AIDS statistics. Little progress has been made in understanding the nuances of MSM sexual behavior or communication that may be perpetuating the spread of HIV. Non-disclosure of an HIV-positive status may be a key factor responsible for male-male HIV transmission. There are no known intervention programs whose primary focus is to help MSM develop requisite skills to disclose their status to casual sexual partners. The development of such interventions is essential because of the numerous repercussions for not disclosing when one is HIV-positive such as legal prosecution and the transmission of HIV. In a previous intervention development study (R21MH067494) the research team created and tested a 4 session intervention found to be promising for increasing disclosure to casual sexual partners. The purpose of the proposed research is to further refine and enhance our HIV disclosure intervention (DI) designed to increase disclosure to casual sexual partners and reduce sexual risk taking behaviors among HIV-positive MSM; assess the relative effectiveness of a disclosure intervention to an attention control case management group (ACCM) for HIV-positive MSM; examine the effects of the intervention over time; explore differential treatment responses to the disclosure intervention and ACCM on the basis of ethnicity, age, and education level as well as examine the mediating effect of baseline frequency of sexual activity, severity of substance abuse at baseline, and stigmatized fear on the relationship between intervention type and the outcome. Finally, the investigators will test how treatment engagement, retention and expectations predict subsequent disclosure and risky sexual outcomes.

First Experimental Study of Transference Work - In Teenagers (FEST-IT) The First Experimental Study on Transference work - In Teenagers (FEST-IT) will be a randomized clinical trial, which will be designed to explore effects of transference work in dynamic psychotherapy in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The design of the study is a so-called dismantling design, in which a single component is added and/or varied to an existent treatment method (psychodynamic psychotherapy). Thus, the efficiency of a specific technique (transference interventions) can be identified.  The primary hypothesis is that the transference group may have a more favorable course over time than will the comparison group.  The second hypothesis is that patients with a history of low Quality of Object Relations score and/or personality disorders-might benefit more from therapy with transference work than from therapy without.  The third hypothesis is that female adolescents may have better treatment effect of transference work than male adolescents.
Analysis of Vestibular Compensation Following Clinical Intervention for Vestibular Schwannoma Multiple sensory cues are typically generated by discrete events, and while they do not reach the cerebrum simultaneously, the brain can bind them temporally if they are interpreted as corresponding to a single event. The temporal binding of vestibular and non-vestibular sensory cues is poorly understood and has not been studied in detail, despite the fact that the vestibular system operates in an inherently multimodal environment. In this study, the researchers are investigating the physiology and pathophysiology of vestibular temporal binding by studying normal subjects, patients with peripheral and central vestibular dysfunction, and patients with vestibular and cochlear signals provided by prosthetic implants in the inner ear.
Neurologic Complications in Spinal Deformity Surgery 240 subjects with "high risk" adult spinal deformity requiring surgical correction will be enrolled in a prospective multi-center international study.

Description of Spondylarthritis and Validation of ASAS Criteria in West Indian Patients Seen in Consultation of Rheumatology. In 2004 an ASAS for the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society decided to work to improve the criteria for classification of spondyloarthropathies to allow for early diagnosis, Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This approach led to the publication in 2009 of the classification criteria for spondylarthritis, in particular axial spondyloarthritis, as well as a proposal to modify the classification of criteria defined by Mr. Amor (AMOR) and European Spondylarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria, taking into account the potential abnormalities visible in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Nuclear (MRI).  The performance (specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values) of the ASAS criteria was then prospectively tested on a sample of the Metropolitan Caucasian population and this systematic study allowed to estimate the performance of the ASAS criteria in the usual framework Of the French Liberal Rheumatology Consultation.  Note that this approach is exposed to a criticism of "circular" approach, indeed the expert who is the gold standard for the diagnosis, uses more or less consciously "criteria" based on the presence of such and such sign, then checks in this selected population the diagnostic validity of these signs.  However, no data on the performance of ASAS criteria are available in populations of African descent.

Cincalcet and Vascular Arterial Stiffness Among Peritoneal Dialysis Patients With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Active parathyroid glands among renal dialysis patients contribute to calcified and hardened blood vessels. Such damage to the blood vessels, in turn, takes a significant toll in terms of cardiovascular disease. Calcimimetics has been suggested to lower the risk of vascular calcification. Role of cinacalcet was demonstrated in animal model but human data are lacking. The investigators designed an open label pilot study to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet in 20 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome is the aortic pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment.
Opioid-free Anesthesia in Gynecologic Surgery Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common for the patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. PONV is a major factor for patient dissatisfaction, delayed patient recovery and increased medical expenses. Opioid-reducing anesthetic regimen is known to decrease PONV and facilitate early recovery after surgery (ERAS) and has been widely accepted recently. In this study, the researchers intend to investigate whether opioid-free anesthesia effectively reduces PONV, and whether it is clinically safe and feasible.
Effects of Treprostinil on Right Ventricular Structure and Function in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension In a group of patients with PAH treated with treprostinil, the current study aims to investigate the effect of treatment on RV structure and function; and correlate changes in RV structure and function with: World Health Organisation (WHO) class, Six-minute walk test, Quality of life (QoL), and Pre-specified biomarkers (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP), Tissue growth factor-B B-type natriuretic peptide BNP, and Profibrotic markers)
A Study of Everolimus in the Treatment of Neurocognitive Problems in Tuberous Sclerosis This is a single centre, two-arm, individually randomised, Phase II, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial of RAD001 (Everolimus) versus placebo in the treatment of neurocognitive problems in patients with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). The IMP is a licensed medicine in this patient group but for a different target of effect. The current trial is a proof of principle study for memory and executive function outcomes.  Following an eligibility visit, patients will be scheduled for baseline visit and randomization. They will then be followed up for 6 months undergoing both safety and neurocognitive assessments whilst taking either the placebo or study drug.  48 patients aged 16 to 60 years with tuberous sclerosis (TSC) who have IQ \> 60 and a significant deficit in one or more primary outcome measures will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 2:1 to either RAD001 (Everolimus) or Placebo.
Intraoperative Infusion of Precedex to Reduce Length of Stay After Lumbar Spine Fusion Major lumbar spine surgery causes inflammation, soreness and swelling that can delay discharge from the hospital. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study will evaluate whether DEX can help get patients out of the hospital faster after major spine surgery by reducing the inflammation associated with the procedure itself. A separate part of the study will evaluate the blood levels of some specific indicators of inflammation called cytokines. Measuring cytokines before and after surgery will aid in determining if DEX has altered the inflammatory response.
Characterization of Sitting Postures in Healthy Subjects The aim of this study is to assess the intra and inter-subjects variability of the pressure measurement cartography in healthy and well and able volunteers, sitting on a rigid base during two hours.
Study of Alcohol-related Liver Disease in Europe Alcohol-induced liver injury is made up of fatty liver, fibrosis and alcoholic hepatitis (AH), elementary lesions that may occur separately, simultaneously or sequentially in a same patient. Among these histological features, alcoholic hepatitis, a necro-inflammatory process is associated with the fastest fibrosis progression leading to cirrhosis in 40% of cases and a pivotal lesion driving increased risk of liver decompensation.  The non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of fibrosis open new perspectives for a better understanding of the natural history of disease-progression from early injury to the cirrhotic stage, for the identification of subgroup patients at risk of developing cirrhosis at medium term and for proposing a strategy of screening of patients with extensive cirrhosis at risk of liver-threatening events. There is an urgent need to perform studies in asymptomatic heavy drinkers in order to identify cut-offs associated with significant risk of development of cirrhosis at medium term. Such objectives require large-scale screening of heavy drinkers. Each of non-invasive methods have been tested to predict with of extensive fibrosis with a high predictive performance as shown below.  A screening policy cannot be accepted without answering the following questions: a) are the requirements of public health screening fulfilled? b) Is the group of patients undergoing screening defined? c) is there a reliable method for of testing? Indeed, the detection of a disease is subject to certain public health requirements and may be proposed to health authorities only if it modifies the management of subjects screened. In the specific case of mass screening of liver fibrosis in heavy drinkers, only the detection of extensive fibrosis could fulfill this criterion because of the potential survival benefit resulting from the screening of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with extensive fibrosis. Indeed, recent studies have found that the probability of receiving curative treatment of HCC was significantly higher in patients who received a six-month surveillance ultrasound. Therefore, the detection of extensive fibrosis seems reasonable in the light of these studies when considering that the yearly risk of development of HCC in the subgroup of heavy drinkers with extensive fibrosis is approximately 3%.  Taking into account the above scientific arguments, the most recent EASL clinical practical guidelines on ALD recommend longitudinal studies using non-invasive tools to evaluate screening of extensive fibrosis and disease progression in heavy drinkers.
Nicotinamide as an Early Alzheimer's Disease Treatment The purpose of this research study is to test whether nicotinamide, also known as vitamin B3 or niacinamide, taken in high doses, can reduce phosphorylation of tau (the protein that accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles) in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.
A Phase 1b Study of PEGylated Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) Combined With Docetaxel in Subjects With Recurrent Previously Treated Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC A Phase 1b study for participants with Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to participate in 1 of 2 portions of this study. The first portion is Dose Escalation in which participants are tested with PEGPH20 at various doses (1.6, 3.0, 2.2 and 2.8 micrograms/kilogram (ug/kg)) in addition to dosing with the standard dose of docetaxel (PDoc) of 75 milligrams/meter squared (mg/m\^2) once every 21-day cycle. Based on observations on the safety and tolerability of study treatment from dose escalation cohorts dosed to date (1.6 and 3.0 ug/kg of PEGPH20), two additional dose levels will be tested, 2.2 and 2.8 ug/kg. Up to 30 additional participants may be enrolled to test these dose levels. The second portion of Phase 1b is Cohort Expansion in which the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PDoc identified in dose escalation is administered every 21 days to approximately 50 participants with high hyaluronan (HA-high) prospectively measured in their tumor tissue.
Clinical Trial to Explore the the Amyloid Beta Draining Effect of Thiethylperazine (TEP) in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Early-to-mild Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in Comparison to Healthy Volunteers This proof-of-mechanism clinical trial study will test the efficacy and safety of thiethylperazine (TEP) in subjects with early onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). There is a strong scientific rationale for this study: TEP is a very well-known substance that has been available since 1961 and approved for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting as well as vertigo. Therefore, it has a well understood pharmacologic background and promising safety data. Using AD mouse models, it has been recently discovered and confirmed that TEP promotes transport of toxic Aβ from the brain into the blood. More importantly, it has also been demonstrated to improve learning deficits in mice. The striking biological effect of TEP in preclinical testing and its known safety and toxicity profile encourages the investigators to investigate this in a multicenter clinical trial in subjects with early-to-mild AD in comparison to healthy volunteers. The investigators will assess whether TEP is able to enhance the transport of Aβ peptides from the brain into the blood in subjects with early-to-mild AD and improves cognitive efficacy.

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Obesity and Brain Function Background:  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and MC4R genetic mutations are two conditions that can cause problems with appetite regulation. People with PWS often have behavior and thinking problems. People with MC4R mutations may have problems with attention. These problems may be related to Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein that is important for brain development. Researchers want to study people with PWS and MC4R mutations to see how BDNF is involved in these conditions. Specifically, body weight and brain function will be studied, and compared with healthy volunteers.  Objectives:  - To study how BDNF affects body weight and brain function in people with PWS and MC4R mutations.  Eligibility:  * Individuals of any age who have Prader-Willi syndrome or MC4R genetic mutations. * Healthy volunteers of any age to act as control participants.  Design:  * Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Height, weight, and waist/hip circumferences will be measured. Blood samples will be taken for genetic and other tests. * Participants will fill out questionnaires about eating habits, pain perception, and sleep behavior. * Participants will keep a 3-day food diary to record all food and drinks eaten. * Tests and questionnaires will be given to study thinking, speech, movement, behavior, and mood. Some tests will be done on a computer; other tests will be on paper. Tests may also involve performing tasks with blocks and other objects. * Participants may have other tests as directed. These will include hot and cold sensitivity tests, imaging studies like x-rays, and measurements of body fat and water content. * Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

Effect of Gene Polymorphism on Cognitive Function The goal of this observational study is to study the effect of gene polymorphism on cognitive improvement in response to exercise in healthy participants. The main questions it aims to answer are:  To investigate whether FNDC5/Irisin genotype polymorphism affects cognitive function and inter-individual variability in exercise response.  To explore whether the FNDC5/Irisin gene polymorphism can act alone or interact with the BDNF gene to cause inter-individual differences in cognitive function responses to exercise gain.  Participants will be asked to perform high-intensity interval training( HIIT) on a cycle ergometer. Each high-intensity training period will be 30 seconds followed by a 4-minute rest period.  The participants will also perform cognitive tests (Vistorian stroop test and Fitlight trainer test) before and after the exercise.
The Efficacy of EMDR in Youngsters With Autism Rationale: Currently, for youngsters there is no treatment available that directly targets the core symptoms of autism. EMDR is hypothesized to improve the core symptoms of ASD by reducing the generally high stress levels experienced during social interactions, and increasing the functional connectivity in neuronal networks associated with executive functioning and limbic circuitry.  Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine if EMDR reduces the core symptoms of ASD and daily experienced stress in youngsters diagnosed with ASD.  Study design: Longitudinal multiple single case studies. Study population: Youngsters aged 12-21 years who are diagnosed with ASD and have a full-scale IQ of 80 or more (N=20).  Intervention: 10 weekly EMDR sessions.  Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint of the study are autism symptoms, which will be assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-A) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS 2). The SRS-A will be administered prior, during and after treatment. The ADOS 2 will be administered prior to treatment and after treatment completion. In addition, we will also administer the Trauma Symptom Investigation Form in Autism Spectrum Disorders (TIF-ASD) questionnaire prior to, during, and after treatment. Furthermore, to answer more fundamental questions concerning the working mechanism of EMDR in ASD, other secondary outcome measures (i.e. PSS-10, AWMA-2) will be included.  Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Participants are expected to benefit from treatment. The risks associated with study participation are considered negligible and the burden associated with participation is estimated as low.

The Histological Analysis in Renal Transplantation Patients With Deterioration of Graft Function Identify the cause of chronic allograft dysfunction using a combination of comprehensive clinical and histologic information in Chinese renal transplant recipients, then to identify the position of CNI nephrotoxicity in CAD.Chronic allograft dysfunction reflects the dual impact of both immunologic and nonimmunologic (primarily calcineurin inhibitor \[CNI\]nephrotoxicity) injury. In previous, CNI nephrotoxicity is overstated and considered one of the major causes of CAD, however, recently there has been found most death-censored graft losses to be the result of alloimmune or autoimmune injury, with only a minority of cases attributable to CNI toxicity. Unfortunately, Situation of objective CNI toxicity in CAD in China is not well analyzed. To improve perception of Neo safety with more local evidence, we want to do a retrospective study to identify the cause of chronic allograft dysfunction using a combination of comprehensive clinical and histologic information in Chinese renal transplantation recipients.

Newborn in Helathy Birthroom: Assessment of Pratical Home and Mother Lived Motherhood Our Lady of Good Help is from the 2006 merger of three hospitals, St. Joseph, Our Lady of Good Help and Saint-Michel. She was transferred to a new building in the heart of Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group website in March 2011. The premises of the birth room are spacious and nice. All delivery rooms are supposed to welcome the mother and child when the birth goes smoothly. There is a resuscitation room (called "Nursery") for newborns requiring medical care. But since the installation in the new building, the investigators had the impression that a number of children born without pathology futures and with good adaptation at birth passed through this room for no apparent medical reason.  The investigators wanted to make an inventory of home practice healthy newborns in our maternity, evaluate the reasons for a possible separation and appreciate the feelings of mothers cope with this separation.
Proteome-based Immunotherapy of Lung Cancer Brain Metastases Trial Hypothesis: Acute, progressing lethal neurooncological process can be transferred into chronic and non-lethal, the survival rates and life quality can be improved by of control of tumor cells (TCs) quantity and targeted regulation of effector functions of tumor stem cells (TSCs).  Brief Description:  The first line therapy of brain metastases of lung cancer (BMLC) involves allogeneic haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), dendritic vaccine (DV) and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs).  TCs and TSCs are isolated from BMLC sample. Dendritic cells are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cultured. Tumor sample provides tumor specific antigens to prepare DV. CTLs are obtained from peripheral blood after DV administrations. HSCs are harvested from closely related donor after granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration.  Allogeneic HSCs are administered intrathecally 5 times every 2 weeks, at day 1, 14, 28, 42, 56. DV is given 3 times every 2 weeks (day 14, 28, 42) subcutaneously in four points. CTLs are administered every 2 weeks for 3 months, then 3 times every 1 month intrathecally. Six months after the therapy completion, the efficiency is evaluated and the cohort demonstrating efficiency continues the therapy, while cohort demonstrating no efficiency is transferred to active comparator arm.  Second line therapy involves DV with recombinant proteins, CTLs and autologous HSC with modified proteome. Autologous HSCs are mobilized by G-CSF.  Carcinogenesis-free intracellular pathways of signal transduction able to respond to targeted regulation of therapeutic cell systems with specific properties, are detected in TSCs using complete transcriptome profiling of gene expression, proteome mapping and profiling of proteins, bioinformation and mathematical analysis and mathematical modeling of protein profiles. To find key oncospecific proteins in TSCs and TCs, the targets for TSCs regulation are detected, as well as protein ligands able to regulate reproductive and proliferative properties of TSCs.  Using these data of TCs and TSCs proteins, the cell preparations to initiate adoptive immune response are prepared: DV loaded with recombinant proteins analogous to key tumor antigens, CTLs and autologous proteome-based HSCs.  Autologous proteome-modified HSCs, DV and CTLs are administered as in the first line therapy.
LIQUID BIOPSY IN Low-grade Glioma Patients Diffuse low-grade gliomas (DLGG) (or WHO grade II gliomas) are rare tumors, with an incidence estimated at 1/105 person-year. DLGG are characterized by a continuous growth and an unavoidable anaplastic transformation. DLGG malignant progression is classically characterized by a continuum, from grade II to grade III or IV tumors.  To date, the histomolecular diagnosis of lower grade gliomas (that is, grade II and III gliomas) is achieved on tumor samples obtained from surgical resection or biopsy. Indeed, whereas brain MRI is often suggestive of DLGG, there is a need for a histological confirmation of diagnosis prior to any medical treatment. Moreover, MRI features to not always accurately predict the tumor grade, with grade II tumor presenting with contrast enhancement or non-enhancing authentic grade III tumors.  In this setting, the value of liquid biopsy (in blood or cerebrospinal fluid CSF) as a non-invasive, disease-associated biomarker has gained interest in the past decade, either at tumor diagnosis or to monitor tumor evolution in order to guide patient management and to detect changes of molecular features over time. While extracranial metastasis of glioma rarely occurs, recent reports suggest the possible presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood of high-grade glioma patients. Beside CTCs, other circulating biomarkers have been recently investigated in glioma, including circulating tumor DNA, microRNA or tumor-educated platelet (TEP) RNA. Some of these techniques allow genome-wide characterization of RNA/DNA contents.  However, these studies are all small exploratory studies that have mainly included glioblastoma (grade IV glioma) patients rather than lower-grade gliomas, or glioma patients with no precision on tumor grade. Moreover, some of these studies analyzed samples performed after the patient received a medical oncological treatment (chemotherapy or radiation therapy). They advocate for the search of a circulating signature that would not be restricted to biomarkers directly derived from the tumor but include markers induced at a distance by the tumor. Indeed, slow-growing DLGG are likely to induce a systemic reaction to allow, for many years, an immuno-tolerance of the tumor. This reaction could have an impact on peripheral blood cells, including their RNA content.  In this study, the investigators aim at conducting an exploratory study in DLGG patients to explore the value of several blood-based biomarkers for the disease diagnosis and/or monitoring.

CHANges iN skEletal muscLe in Heart Failure The mechanisms behind heart failure are largely unknown. Despite an increasing arsenal of pharmacological therapies, cardiovascular disease is still the most common cause of death in the western world, which demonstrates a pronounced need for more patient-related mechanistic research. Cachexia and limited exercise capacity are the symptoms that best match prediction of heart failure, both of which are symptoms involving a dysfunctional skeletal muscle. An increased understanding of the mechanisms and signaling pathways connects the failure heart with skeletal muscle dysfunction is likely to lead both to discoveries of prognostic factors and possible therapeutic options.  The study is a prospective, non-blinded, study. The study will consist of the assignment of patients with heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) III-IV, 60-80 years old. One hundred (100) patients will be enrolled in this study.

Comparison Between Clinical and MRI Multiple Sclerosis Activity and Expression of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Type W and Herpesvirus Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. It is known that your etiology has genetic and environmental causes. Several viruses have been implicated as triggers as well as perpetrators of this disease. Several studies make the correlation between Endogenous Retrovirus Type W (HERV-W) and the family Herpesviridae and activity in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. The most important characteristics of the virus implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease is the fact that they have latency periods of exacerbation and they have, as their main biological environment, the central nervous system. The HERV-W, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, herpes virus type 6 and type 7 herpesvirus members are the most studied as causes of multiple sclerosis. It was found that these viruses are closely involved in the pathogenesis of MS, but it is believed that aren't the only responsible for its beginning. It is likely that this disease presents numerous triggers and more studies are needed to determine these interactions. In addition, a study comparing the activity of multiple sclerosis with the presence of these viruses was never realized.
Modulation of Muscle Protein Metabolism by Essential Amino Acids The investigators plan to explore the ability of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins in our bodies and in the food we eat, to stimulate muscles to grow and stay strong. The investigators will investigate how rapidly after one meal the human body is ready to make use of a second meal and look at the molecular mechanisms underlying this. The investigators will look at these phenomena in older men as this group is known to be subject to a gradual loss of muscle mass and strength.
Study to Determine the Relationship Between Exercise and Hypoglycemia in Children With Type 1 Diabetes The main purpose of this study is to find out how often low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) happens during the night after exercise in the late afternoon. The study also will see if there are any factors that can predict if low blood sugar is going to develop. Blood samples will also be drawn to measure two hormones-glucagon and epinephrine (adrenaline)-to see how they are affected by exercise. Glucagon helps to raise the blood sugar when it is low. Epinephrine causes symptoms that make the person aware that the blood sugar is low. From the blood sample, other substances in the blood may also be measured to see how they are affected by exercise.  A second purpose of the study is to find out whether exercise affects the accuracy of a continuous glucose sensor (CGMS made by Medtronic Minimed).  The study will also look at the accuracy of different home glucose meters.
Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of a Vaccine Against Essential Hypertension The study medication CYT006-AngQb is a vaccine, consisting of angiotensin II (Ang II), the naturally occurring octapeptide coupled onto the surface of virus-like particles (VLP). This form of presenting Ang II to the immune system induces a B-cell mediated immune response characterized by the generation of specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) against Ang II. The CYT006-AngQb vaccine is administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. Immunization against angiotensin II may offer a valuable alternative to conventional drugs for the treatment of hypertension.
Efficacy Study of Strattera for Treating Attention Disorders in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Atomoxetine is the only medication that is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults. It has gained recent interest as an alternative medication for treating attentional problems related to traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it's effectiveness in this population has not been studied. There are a number of advantages of Atomoxetine over traditional neuro-stimulant medications currently used for attentional disorders after traumatic brain injury. This study will use a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design to investigate the efficacy of atomoxetine to improve attention, behavioral function, and depression in adults with TBI
Comparison of GlideScope Specific Stylet to Malleable Stylet for GlideScope Intubation The GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon) is an intubating device that uses a high-resolution camera embedded into a plastic laryngoscope blade. An LED provides illumination. The GlideScope often provides a good laryngoscopic view, but passing the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords is sometimes difficult. Because of the 60 degree anterior curvature of the GlideScope's blade, ETT's must have stylets inserted so that the ETT distal tip can be positioned anteriorly. Various authors have recommended different angles of the ETT to optimally place it into the trachea. Previous study demonstrated that 90 degree sharp bend was both faster and subjectively easier in a heterogeneous group of intubators. With the introduction of a rigid GlideScope Specific Stylet by the manufacturer, the question arises as to the the best configuration of stylet for the ETT. Therefore, this prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial is proposed.  The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between the GlideScope Specific Stylet and the standard malleable stylet.
Rapid Response VA-ECMO in Refractory Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest A selected group of patients with refractory cardiac arrest may benefit from inhospital treatment and this may warrant transfer to the hospital with ongoing CPR. In patients with VF or ventricular tachycardia (VT) the underlying cause may be reversible and damage to other organs is limited at the time of the arrest. Many patients will have a coronary event that can be treated by angioplasty. However, up to now absence of ROSC poses a barrier for angioplasty, and most patients are therefore not even transported to a hospital. With the use of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) the circulation can be restored immediately, providing time to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest. International cohort studies show that a strategy of pre-hospital triage and transport to a cardiac arrest expertise center for "rapid-response" ECMO and coronary revascularization is feasible and improves survival.  A clinical pathway will encompass intense cooperation and optimal logistics between several paramedical and medical disciplines, i.e. from prehospital ambulance service to intensive care. Incorporation of mechanical chest compressions devices (LUCAS™), rapid-response veno-arterial (VA-)ECMO (Cardiohelp, Maquet), and ECMO assisted revascularization in a dedicated clinical pathway will offer a potential lifesaving treatment option that is in accordance with the recommendations in the current Guidelines.  The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of a new local clinical pathway in our hospital to provide ECPR for refractory OHCA patients.

Finding the effect of aquatic physical therapy in enhancing the post-operative outcomes.
Orkambi Exercise Study Shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exercise is a major source of distress and is a commonly reported symptom in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A recent treatment option known as Orkambi, which combines the drugs lumacaftor and ivacaftor, may be used in patients with CF to help improve lung health. However, the effects of this combination therapy on dyspnea and exercise performance, a known predictor of survival in CF, are not clear. The investigators aim to understand the effects of Orkambi on these symptoms and to gain new insight into the potential health improvements in CF from using this treatment option.
The Effectiveness of Warm Hand Bath in Improving Anxiety Patients undergoing surgery often experience anxiety before the procedure. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of warm water baths in reducing preoperative anxiety levels in middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery. This study utilizes a randomized controlled trial design and focuses on middle-aged and elderly patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery in the orthopedic ward of a medical center in northern Taiwan. The patients are divided into an experimental group and a control group using block randomization. Patients in the experimental group receive a 10-minute warm water bath at 40°C on the evening before surgery as an intervention, while the control group receives standard care. Data are collected from both groups before and after the intervention, including personal information, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Visual Analog Scale for pain assessment, and Visual Analog Scale for relaxation, as well as vital sign measurements. Statistical analysis of the data is conducted using SPSS version 18.0 software, employing mean values, standard deviations, percentages, independent t-tests, chi-square tests, paired-sample t-tests, and generalized estimating equations for data analysis.
Effect of a Locally Delivered Probiotic in Periodontitis Saccharomyces boulardii is commonly employed as a live non-pathogenic probiotic microbial feed or food supplement. S. boulardii reduces the secretion of key pro inflammatory cytokines and promotes the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, which is pertinent in the context of pathogenic mechanisms in periodontitis.

Efficacy of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists According to Type 2 Diabetes Subtypes The goal of this observational retrospective study is to understand whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), which are a group of antidiabetes drugs, may act differently in different subtypes of patients with type 2 diabetes.  The main questions it aims to answer are:  * people with type 2 diabetes belonging to specific subtypes respond better (or worse) to GLP-1RA? * the beneficial effect of GLP-1RA may last longer in people with type 2 diabetes belonging to specific subtypes? * what are the clinical characteristics that better explain the efficacy and durability of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes management?  Clinical data from records of patients attending the diabetes outpatient clinic of our facility will be retrieved to compare the outcomes of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients belonging to four subtypes of type 2 diabetes.

An Open-label, Multi-center Study Evaluating the Validity, Reliability, and Responsiveness of a New Female-specific Angina Questionnaire in Women With Chronic Angina Treated With Ranolazine Extended-release Tablets (CVT 3041) According to the American Heart Association (AHA) 2011 update of heart disease and stroke statistics, more than 9 million adult patients in the United States (US) have angina. This update also notes that a study of 4 national cross-sectional health examination studies found that, among Americans 40 to 74 years of age, the age-adjusted prevalence of angina was higher among women than men. Per ACC/AHA guidelines, the goal of antianginal therapy is the complete or near complete elimination of anginal chest pain and a return to normal activities and functional capacity. However, evaluating angina and responses to antianginal therapy is often not straightforward. This is particularly true of female patients with angina. Because angina and response to antianginal therapy may differ in men and women, an instrument designed specifically to address symptomatology in women with angina could enhance our understanding and characterization of angina and responses to therapy in this population. The current study will evaluate the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the newly developed Women's Ischemia Symptom Questionnaire (WISQ) based on changes in angina symptomatology in a female angina population treated with ranolazine, compared with the widely used Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ).
Affective Dysregulation (AD) in Children With ADHD Treated by Guanfacin Early onset, high prevalence and persistence, as well as developmental comorbidity make affective dysregulation (AD) in childhood one of the most psychosocially impairing and cost-intensive mental conditions. Despite continuous research, there is still a substantial need for optimization of individual treatment strategies in order to improve outcomes and to reduce subjective and economic burden. Here we want to study the change of psychopathological markers of affective dysregulation (AD) treatment of affective dysregulation (AD) in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) treated by Guanfacine. These children did not respond to methylphenidate treatment. The results will allow the generation of a hypothesis for a randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of Guanfacine for the treatment of AD in children.
Effectiveness of Insoles Provided to Patients With Diabetes. A Longitudinal Randomized Controlled Study in Gothenburg Introduction: Insoles and shoes are frequently prescribed to prevent foot ulcers in patients at risk of diabetes. A combination of neuropathy and foot deformities raises the risk from 1% to between 4-7% according to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, Guidelines Diabetes Care 2010. Preventative care, which includes foot care, annual inspection of the feet, education and prescription of insoles in combination with well fitting shoes are supposed to decrease the risk of ulcers and prevent amputation. Further research is, however, needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these commonly prescribed insoles. The aim of this study is to compare three different types of insoles with respect to pressure distribution. Every 6 months follow-up is assessed until 24 months is reached.
Creatine Effect on Brown Adipose Tissue Activation Pre-clinical studies indicate that creatine may play a substantial role in diet-induced thermogenesis and may have a profound effect on energy balance. A recent retrospective study of BAT activation on PET-CT scans in humans showed a positive association with the estimated renal creatinine clearance and BAT activation, possibly linking creatine metabolism in humans to BAT activity. In humans, so far little options are available to activate brown adipose tissue. The most potent intervention to activate BAT is via cold, which has previously been shown to have metabolic effects in humans. Provided the potential health benefits of brown adipose tissue activation in humans, and provided the role of brown fat in diet induced thermogenesis, we here aim to determine whether creatine monohydrate supplementation can increase diet-induced thermogenesis and activate brown adipose tissue in humans.
Exogenous Surfactant in Very Preterm Neonates in Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Advances in perinatal care have made it possible to improve the survival of the most immature neonates, but at the cost of an increase in the population at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Measures that have attempted to limit the development of BPD are not always effective, or related to major side effects. The physiopathological factors that are identified in BPD should, in theory, respond to surfactant. Therefore, the use of an exogenous surfactant in neonates presenting with pulmonary disease requiring mechanical ventilation, leading to a significant risk of BPD, should allow earlier extubation and thus promote pulmonary healing and growth.

Phase II Trial of FOLFOX6, Bevacizumab and Cetuximab in Patients With Colorectal Cancer Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab and cetuximab may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab and cetuximab works in treating patients with stage IV colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

Use of Wearable Activity Tracker in Elderly Undergoing Abdominal Surgery Early mobilization is an important element in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS). It reduces risk of conditions which are related to prolonged bed rest such as deep vein thrombosis, lung atelectasis, pneumonia, and sacral sore. (Appelboom, Taylor et al. 2015) It is also associated with shortened length of hospital stay, improved survival, and reduction in health care cost.  However, "early mobilization" was not defined consistently in previous study. Some authors recommend patients to get out of bed and ambulate on the day of operation while others define as getting out of bed more than 2 hours on day of operation and up to 8 hours on second post-operative day. (Wolk, Meissner et al. 2017) The inconsistency in definition is partly due to the inability to quantify patients' mobility which is usually self-reported by patients and is subjective.(Eva van der Meij 2017) This is especially true for elderly patient in whom preoperative mobility varies significantly between individuals. For this reason, the approach of early mobilization in elderly should be goal directed and individualized according to their preoperative mobility and functional status.  The aim of current study is to monitor and motivate elderly patients undergoing abdominal surgery to increase postoperative mobilization by using Fitbit Zip activity tracker.
Improving SUrgery of Liver Metastases: a Trial of the Arterial Chemotherapy Network National trial, multicenter, randomized, phase II comparing treatment intensification with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy plus systemic chemotherapy (CT) to systemic chemotherapy alone in patients with liver-only colorectal metastases (CRLM) considered still non resectable after at least two months of systemic induction chemotherapy.
Neurosensory Assesment After Using Separators Vs Chisels in Bilateral Sagittal Split Mandibular Osteotomy. RCT The bilateral sagittal split Ramus osteotomy (BSSRO) was introduced by Trauner and Obwegeser. Since then, many modifications of this procedure have been reported, leading to a less difficult and more predictable procedure for correcting mandibular anomalies. persistent post-operative neurosensory disturbances of the inferior alveolar nerve are still one of the major complications of this operation. The incidence has decreased over the years due to improved techniques and the use of different instruments. However, most recent series still report postoperative persistent hypesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve in more than 10% of the patients up to 48%.  There are no reports on the influence of other surgical variables on the persisting post-operative hypesthesia. Several methods have been reported for evaluating neurosensory disturbances of the inferior alveolar nerve. One of the simplest methods reported is tactile evaluation based on subjective sensation reported by the patients. Many authors have used this method in their evaluation of post-operative hypesthesia.
Phase II Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin & Bevacizumab for Metastatic / Unresectable Neuroendocrine Tumors Given the lack of other viable treatment options for metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, contrasted with our positive anecdotal experience, and the relative tolerability of the treatment regimen for colorectal cancer patients, we propose a single-institution phase II trial investigating the efficacy of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Stress ECG Test for the Evaluation of the Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death in a Paediatric Cohort With WPW Pattern Patients with preexcitation are at risk for sudden cardiac death. The pathogenesis is a rapid antegrade conduction of atrial fibrillation over the accessory pathway to the ventricle resulting in ventricular fibrillation. Today it is possible to eliminate the conduction over the accessory pathway by catheter intervention (radiofrequency ablation) with a low rate of complications and a high rate of success. In clinical practice it is therefore important to estimate the risk for sudden cardiac death in an individual patient to give an advice to the patient and the parents about the further evaluation and therapeutic strategy. The velocity of the conduction over the accessory pathway can be estimated by analysing the ECG during sinus tachycardia. If the preexcitation disappears at a relatively low heart rate, the risk for sudden death is less than in patients with persisting preexcitation at the maximal heart rate. Compared to the gold standard i.e. measurement of the refractory period of the accessory pathway during invasive electrophysiological study (EPS), the measurements at the stress ECG have been reported to be a relatively poor indicator for an elevated risk which may be explained by a high intraindividual variability of this test. This study is designed to define the clinical relevance of the stress ECG in paediatric patients with preexcitation (compared to the invasive electrophysiological study).  First Hypothesis:  The results of the 3 stress ECG-tests are reproducible in an individual patient.  Null hypothesis: there is no difference between the three measurements of cycle length during stress ECG. Alternate hypothesis: the difference between the three measurements of cycle length is \> 10%.  Second Hypothesis:  There is a close correlation between the results at stress ECG and the results at the invasive electrophysiological Intervention.
Prevelane and Short Term Outcome of Hypernatremic Dehydration in Children With Acute Gastroenteritis in Sohag University Hospital Hypernatremic dehydration (HND) is a common and potentially life-threatening condition in children. It is defined by a serum level of sodium greater than or equal to 145 mmol/L . HND is a type of acute dehydration constitutes a medical emergency and requires a rapid diagnosis for adequate and quick management. It is characterized by a deficit of total body water (TBW) relative to total body sodium (TBS) levels due to either loss of free water, or excessive administration of hypertonic sodium solutions. It is common in infants. Net water loss as seen in diarrhea is the most common cause of hypernatremia. Clinical interventions at the hospital settings or accidental sodium loading usually cause hypertonic sodium gain. It is common in developing countries where gastroenteritis is a common problem.  Most children with hypernatremia are dehydrated and have the typical signs and symptoms as weight loss, decreased skin turgor, pale skin color, and dry mucous membranes. Hypernatremia, even without dehydration, cause central nervous system symptoms according to the degree of sodium elevation and the acuity of the increase. Patients are irritable, restless weak, and lethargic. Some infants have a high-pitched cry. Alert patients are very thirsty, although nausea and fever may be present.  HND can lead to neurological impairment due to brain shrinkage, which can tear cerebral blood vessels, leading to brain hemorrhage. Cerebral hemorrhages are the most serious complications of HND that can eventually lead to convulsions and even coma .  The first priority in managing a child with HND is to stop the ongoing water loss by treating the underlying cause. The next step is to restore the intravascular volume with isotonic fluid. Dehydration can be treated with oral, nasogastric, or intravenous fluids. The child is given a fluid bolus, usually 20 mL/kg of the isotonic solution, over about 20 to 30 minutes. More severe dehydration needs repeated boluses at a faster rate. After the fluid bolus is given, the signs of dehydration should be reassessed in order to confirm a complete rehydration. Fluid loss should not be corrected rapidly. Cerebral edema as well as convulsions is serious risks during rapid rehydration, so correction of deficit should be achieved slowly and gradually over 48 hours and should not be decreased to less than 12 mEq/L. To prevent cerebral edema and convulsion, individuals with hypernatremia should be managed in such a way that the reduction rate of serum sodium occurs at approximately 10 to 12 mmol/L/24 hr.  Cerebral edema and seizures can be consequences of rapid correction of serum sodium level in these patients in whom the rate of fluid and sodium administration are inappropriate

Effect of ZT-01 on Glucagon During Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus The purpose of this study is to determine whether ZT-01 increases the glucagon response to hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes (T1D). ZT-01 is a specific somatostatin (SST) type 2 receptor antagonist hypothesized to increase the counterregulatory glucagon release during hypoglycemia, which is impaired in diabetes, and may thus reduce the occurrence of hypoglycemia.  Approximately 25 participants with well-controlled type 1 diabetes will be recruited to a crossover study and be randomized to the order in which they receive a single administration of placebo, low dose and high dose ZT-01 during three euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamps 2 to 6 weeks apart, with a follow-up visit approximately 1 week after the final clamp.  Participants will stay overnight in the clinic before each clamp, and their plasma glucose (PG) will be kept at euglycemic levels with IV insulin and dextrose as needed. The following morning, the clamp will begin and the subject's PG will be kept at 5.5 mmol/L (euglycemia) with variable IV insulin (and dextrose as needed). Study treatment will be administered during this euglycemic period, and then insulin will be increased so that PG falls to a plateau of mild hypoglycemia, and then increased further to clinically significant hypoglycemia. Release of glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones will be measured, and a symptom score will be completed, during euglycemia before and following study treatment, and during each level of hypoglycemia. Following the clamp, the participant's blood glucose will be returned to normal levels prior to leaving the clinic.

Influence of Area of Brain Damage on Brain Reorganization After Chronic Stroke This study will examine how the brain rewires itself to make up for the lack of movement many people with stroke experience. It will try to determine if the rewiring differs depending on the location of the stroke and the amount of time since the stroke occurred. For some stoke patients, weakness may persist, while others recover completely after time. It is not known which parts of the brain are involved in the recovery of different types of stroke and if the type of stroke affects recovery.  People 18 years of age and older who have had subacute thromboembolic or hemorrhagic stroke more than 3 months before enrolling may participate in this study.  Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center three times every 2 years for up to 10 years. At the first visit, patients have a neurological examination and perform tests of motor abilities such as lifting small objects, turning cards, using a spoon, stacking checkers and lifting cans during a short period of time as rapidly as possible.  At the second visit, subjects have structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the scan, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder, wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking noises associated with the scanning process. Total scan time is about 30 minutes  At the third visit, subjects perform some simple movement tasks during functional MRI (fMRI) scans. The procedure is the same as with structural MRI, except that subjects are asked to perform simple movement tasks in the scanner. Before the fMRI scans, electrodes are attached to the subject's arms and legs to monitor muscle activity (surface electromyography). Total scan time is about 1.5 hours. Movement tasks might include pinching a force-measuring instrument with the fingers, pressing different keys on a keyboard as fast as possible, inserting pegs into small holes on a board, lifting weights, flipping cards or similar activities.
Chronic, Low Dose Erythropoetin Beta in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy The study is testing the hypothesis, that the application of low dose erythropoetin beta (35 I.E./kg BW/week) for 6 months following successful coronary revascularization by PCI improves left ventricular remodeling as assessed by cardiac MRI.

Comparative Study Between the Efficacy of The Serratus Anterior Plane Block and Lumbar Intrathecal Fentanyl Injection for Postoperative Analgesia After Modified Radical Mastectomy Modiﬁed radical mastectomy (MRM) is one of the most common surgeries performed, and one that may be associated with signiﬁcant acute postoperative pain in breast surgery. Acute postoperative pain is an independent risk factor in the development of chronic post-mastectomy pain .  Various regional anesthetic procedures have been tried to provide better acute pain control and, consequently, less chronic pain. They can reduce perioperative opiates requirement and thereby decreasing their possible side effects. These regional procedures include local wound inﬁltration, lumbar intrathecal fentanyl injection, thoracic epidural, thoracic paravertebral block (PVB), and ultrasound (US)-guided interfascial plane blocks. Currently, Ultrasound (US)-guided interfascial plane blocks have been recommended as safe, easy, and reliable alternatives to the use of thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks in providing analgesia for patients about to undergo breast surgery.  Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) is one of the Ultrasound (US)-guided interfascial plane blocks, it blocks the intercostal nerves II-VI by injection above or below the serratus muscle in the mid-axillary line and spares the pectoral nerves.  We assumed that SAPB could safely provide a better analgesic proﬁle with an opioid-sparing effect than Intrathecal fentanyl. We will perform this study to evaluate this assumption.
Comparison of Dynamic Versus Static Lag Screw Modes for Cephalomedullary Nails Used to Fix Intertrochanteric Fragility Fractures The objective of this study is to compare the failure rate between two modes of fixing the lag screw of the cephalomedullary nail.  The sample studied will be patients who have been diagnosed with a fragility intertrochanteric fracture.  Investigators hypothesis is that the dynamic mode will have a lower failure rate compared to the static mode.
Non-invasive Focal Therapy for Osteoid Osteoma Non-invasive treatment of Osteoid osteoma using MRI guided high-intensity focused ultrasound. This study is designed as an intention-to-treat using a totally non-invasive approach for pain reduction, quality of life improvement and long-term bone restoration. Procedure is performed in a single session using limited amount of acoustic energy to target the osteoid nidus. Treatment will be performed under anesthesia (peripheral or general according to age and lesion position).
Impact of Adductor Canal Block on Functional Recovery TKA involves extensive bone resection as well as soft tissue excision and therefore is associated with profound postoperative pain. Adequate analgesia after TKA is therefore considered paramount to facilitate early hospital discharge and effective functional recovery.
Comparative Study Between Prader-Willi Patients Who Take Oxytocin Versus Placebo The role of oxytocin (OT) is already known in the regulation of satiety but some clinical studies demonstrated that OT participates also in the regulation of social behavior by its implication on a better comprehension of emotion which plays a role on theory of mind and empathy. By the way, these 2 behaviors are deviants for patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Actually, no study was led on the effect of OT on PWS patients but Swaab and al in 1995 showed a significant reduction in number and in volume of neurons expressing OT in the paraventricular nucleus of PWS patients. Recent data were obtained studying OT in patients with autism which showed a link between the deregulation of OT and the autistic pathology. Clinical and imaging studies obtained with PWS and autistic populations make us believe that some mechanisms are common between these two pathologies.  The objectives of this project are:  1. to look for an influence on the understanding of the social codes of the PWS patients, 2. to look for an influence on the behavior of stress and anxiety and on the regulation of eating habits when patients receive a nasal pulverizing of OT.
The Aim of This Study is to Compare the Effects of Instrument-assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) Used in Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) and to Determine Whether They Are Superior to Conservative Treatment (CT) The Aim of This Study is to Compare the Effects of Instrument-assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) Used in Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) and to Determine Whether They Are Superior to Conservative Treatment (CT). 42 Female Patients Diagnosed With MPS Were Included in the Study. The Patients Were Randomly Divided Into Three Groups of 14 People Each. CT (Hot Pack, TENS, Ultrasound) Was Applied to the First Group. CT+IASTM Was Applied to the Second Group and CT+ESWT Was Applied to the Third Group. All Groups Received Treatment for 3 Weeks (CT: 5 Sessions Per Week, 15 Sessions in Total, ESWT and IASTM: 2 Sessions Per Week, 6 Sessions in Total). Neck Stretching Exercises Were Given to All Patients as a Home Program. Before and After the Treatment, the Pain Intensity of the Patients Was Determined by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Pressure Pain Threshold Was Measured With an Algometer. Cervical Joint Range of Motion (CROM) Was Measured With a CROM Device. Pain, Cervical Mobility, Quality of Life, and Sleep Parameters Were Evaluated With the Neck Outcome Score Questionnaire (NOOS). Depression and Anxiety Parameters Were Evaluated With the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

Ketamine Treatment for Pediatric-Refractory Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) This pilot study is proposed to determine the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of ketamine, a medication that modulates glutamate in the brain, as a rapid treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in adolescents and young adults with OCD. This study will recruit 6 youth (ages 14-22) who are diagnosed with clinically significant OCD and have failed at least one adequate trial of a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SRI) medication and a course of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) (unless unable to access or tolerate) for OCD in the past. Participants will receive a single infusion of intravenous ketamine and be assessed at regular intervals post-infusion for up to 14 days. At the end of the 14-day treatment phase, all participants will be offered three months of open treatment for OCD with medication and/or CBT.
Resolution of Microalbuminuria and Dysmetabolism Following Bariatric Surgery: Prospective Study Favorable effects of bariatric surgery have been demonstrated in particular regarding increased insulin sensitivity, decreased blood pressure, improved blood lipids and decreased cardiovascular risk. After surgery, weight loss also leads to improvement of the chronic inflammatory state related to obesity, a strong predictor of the metabolic status. Although obese patients are often affected with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, both related to renal impairment, the existence of a distinct mechanism by which obesity would cause chronic renal insufficiency has been suggested. The mechanisms underlying obesity-related nephropathy have been proposed to involve hyperfiltration, expansion of mesangial cells, hyperperfusion leading to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, as noted in obese dogs. In humans, improvements in renal function may be observed following bariatric surgery, although some reported a possibility of increased nephrolithiases. Whether biliopancreatic diversion and gastrectomy alone have similar effects is uncertain. More prospective studies are needed to assess the impact of all types of weight loss surgery to reverse chronic renal insufficiency.  The objective of this study is to document changes in microalbuminuria and metabolic parameters in patients with altered renal function undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients enrolled in the study will show renal function impairment as demonstrated by albumin/creatinine ratio alterations in 2 out of 3 measurements taking place before surgery. We will perform a prospective study of renal function markers (albumin/creatinine ratio) and metabolic parameters (blood lipids, glucose, insulin, inflammatory markers) before and 6, 12, 24 months after surgery in patients with microalbuminuria at study onset (albumin/creatinine ratio 2.0-20.0 mg/mmol in men and 2.8-28.0 mg/mmol in women). Data will be analysed with repeated measures analyses in both subgroup. Thereafter, a linear regression model will be created to adjust for potentially confounding factors such as hypertension and diabetes. We hypothesize that patients with severe obesity and altered renal function, whether they are diabetic or not, have improved microalbuminuria and metabolic parameters following biliopancreatic diversion with sleeve gastrectomy or sleeve gastrectomy alone. The extent of renal function recovery will correlate directly with metabolic improvements.
Choline-PET for Evaluating the Incidence of Nodal Metastases Among Newly Diagnosed Patients of Prostate Cancer Nodal involvement among patients with prostate cancer is known to be a poor prognostic factor. Traditionally, the presence or absence of nodal disease in patients with prostate cancer is ascertained with the use of anatomical imaging methods such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  However, the sensitivities of CT and MRI for the detection of pelvic nodal disease is rather low, with reports placing the value to lie between 50-80%.  Positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of carbon-11 or fluorine-18 tagged choline (Choline-PET) is an approach which is known to deliver a high sensitivity for the imaging of prostate cancer disease burden in the primary, nodal and the metastatic areas.  The investigators in this prospective trial intend to utilize Choline-PET among all newly diagnosed patients of prostate cancer who are presumed to be non-N1 (absence of nodal disease on conventional imaging) and non-M1 (absence of metastatic disease on conventional imaging).

Prevalence of Mental Health Problems Among Undergraduate Students at the Universidad de Los Andes This project seeks to know the prevalence of mental health problems among undergraduate students, through internationally and nationally validated screening instruments. The project also aims to understand better the associated factors contributing to the mental health problems of this population. Through the critical analysis of the results, our proposal aims to establish the prevalence of anxiety, depression, suicidality and substance use, and the association with socioeconomic features, academic stress, sense of belonging to the university, interpersonal relationships, and sleep habits among other factors. Once finalized the study, the results obtained will be disseminated to the university community and published in peer-reviewed journals.  The results will help the university authorities to design and implement measures to prevent mental health problems in this community.
Cholesterol and Statin in Healthy Adults Statins are a class of drugs that are the most commonly prescribed medications in developing countries. Statins act on the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase to inhibit its conversion to mevalonate, a precursor for cholesterol synthesis. Subsequently statins are prescribed to patients with relatively high blood cholesterol levels. However, taking statins does not come without side effects. Most notably, the effects of statins on muscle wasting have been studied extensively. This includes up-regulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system, muscle cell damage and rhabdomyolysis, elevated creatine kinase, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Due to the negative side effects of statin therapy, additional therapies are warranted to help offset the effects on muscle wasting.  Loss of muscle mass is a significant concern as it is associated with a reduction in muscle strength and power (Ferrando et al., 1996; Creditor, 1993). This condition is observed in aging, disease states, and long periods of unloading such as hospital admission and can lead to disability, increased falls, loss of independence, and mortality. Subsequently, there is a critical need to develop interventions to counteract this loss of muscle mass and strength. Exercise is one such intervention, however, in some cases may not be a feasible option. For instance, exercise has been demonstrated to exacerbate the muscle side of effects of statins. Subjects complain of increased muscle soreness and have elevated creatine kinase levels and they also do not want to take statins anymore (Kearns et al., 2008; Parker et al., 2012; Sinzinger et al., 2004). Because of this limitation, there is a critical need to develop other interventions that can prevent the loss of muscle mass during statin use.
Study to Assess Change in Disease Activity and Adverse Events of Oral Venetoclax With Intravenous (IV) Obinutuzumab in Adult Participants With Recurring Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia (cancer of blood cells). The purpose of this study is to assess retreatment with venetoclax-obinutuzumab (VenG) in participants previously treated with fixed duration first-line (IL) therapy of venetoclax in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody +/- X (where X is any additional drug). Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.  Venetoclax is an approved drug for the treatment of CLL. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 2 groups, called cohorts, based on when symptoms of CLL came back after previous treatment in first-line. Approximately 75 adult participants with CLL who have been treated with venetoclax in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody +/- X will be enrolled in the study in approximately 60 sites worldwide.  Participants will receive intravenous (IV) obinutuzumab + oral venetoclax (VenG) in 28-day cycles for a total of 6 cycles per cohort, followed by 6 to 18 cycles of venetoclax alone, for a total treatment of 12 to 24 cycles, depending on the cohort.  There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.
The Efficacy of Papaverine to Prevent Radial Artery Spasm During Transradial Cerebral Angiography Rationale:Papaverine is effective on radial artery spasm during transradial cerebral angiography.  Purpose: This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, phase 2b trial aims to investigate the effect and safety of papaverine in treating radial artery spasm during transradial cerebral angiography.
Correlative Biomarker Study in Patients With Myeloproliferative Disorders Researchers will use abnormal blood and/or bone marrow cells, or materials derived from these abnormal cells, like DNA, RNA, protein or plasma, in laboratory studies. Toenail clippings will provide normal material like DNA for comparison with the abnormal material derived from the blood and/or bone marrow. The results of these studies will be correlated with subjects' disease symptoms and response to their experimental treatment. The MPD-RC researchers are interested in studying molecules from the blood and bone marrow, the exact molecules changing over time with the investigators choosing only the most promising for investigation.  The investigators are attempting to better understand the causes of MPD and to develop improved methods for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. These syndromes carry a high risk of developing leukemia. It is important to continue to learn more about these blood cancers and to learn more about the effectiveness and potential side effects of various treatments. It is believed that further basic knowledge about these cancer cells as well as the effects of treatment will lead to the improvement of current therapies and the development of entirely new treatments for these diseases. The MPD-RC is hoping to determine if a number of laboratory tests (biomarkers) will allow for the prediction of response in future patients to the treatment they would receive.
Genetic Study of Schizophrenia This large ongoing study at NIMH investigates the neurobiology of schizophrenia by identifying susceptibility genes, evaluating their impact on brain function to better understand how to treat and prevent this illness.
Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) People who inject drugs (PWID) experience high risk of HIV acquisition. Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious biomedical HIV prevention strategy for high risk HIV-uninfected individuals including PWID, yet uptake has been low in this population and uptake and adherence interventions have not been developed or tested. Drawing from formative qualitative research, the overall goal of this project is to develop an intervention to promote PrEP uptake and adherence among PWID in the U.S. Northeast. The investigators will:  * Analyze existing literature and data to identify specific barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake and adherence among PWID to inform the initial adaptation of existing theory-based interventions; * Conduct qualitative interviews with \~30 PWID and \~10 key informants (PrEP and other clinical and social service providers) to identify intervention targets; * Develop and iteratively refine and finalize an intervention manual based on feedback from qualitative exit-interviews with an interventionist and \~10 PWID; and * Conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) in \~50 HIV-uninfected PWID to compare PrEP uptake and adherence outcomes and assess intervention feasibility and acceptability.

An Open-label Study to Assess the Long-term Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of KarXT in Adult Patients With Schizophrenia (EMERGENT-5) This is a Phase 3, multicenter, 56-week, outpatient, open-label (OL) study to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in de novo subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fifth Edition (DSM-5) schizophrenia. In this OL study, all subjects will receive KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice daily \[BID\]) for up to 52 weeks. The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in subjects with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy and characterize the pharmacokinetics of xanomeline and trospium after administration of KarXT.
Cognitive Changes After Major Joint Replacement - Full Trial (Cognigram 2) Patients assume that cognitive performance rapidly returns to baseline after anesthesia and surgery. Several studies have shown that one week after major non-cardiac surgery about 27% of patients have postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and 10% of patients at 3 months. Very few studies have assessed the incidence of POCD beyond 3 months. POCD significantly reduces quality of life. Identifying risk factors for POCD is important because it is associated with prolonged hospital stay, loss of independence, and premature retirement. There is an urgent need to measure and document the level of cognitive change associated with surgery with an easy to use tool, both prior to admission and after discharge. This information can be used to plan appropriate care paths and to identify or test the efficacy of potential new treatments to alter the negative trajectory.
Comparative Trial for Pixantrone in Combination With Rituximab in Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining pixantrone (BBR 2778, INN name pending) with the monoclonal antibody rituximab, leads to an increase in the period of patients' remission, compared to rituximab alone.
Fluorescent Imaging of Nerves With Illuminare-1 During Surgery This study will test the safety of using Illuminare-1 during standard surgery for prostate cancer. The study researchers will test increasing doses of Illuminare-1 to find the dose that makes the nerve structures fluoresce (light up) but causes few or mild side effects. When the researchers find this dose, it will be tested in new groups of study participants to see whether surgery performed using Illuminare-1 guidance is better than surgery performed without intraoperative guidance. The researchers will also do tests to study the way the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of Illuminare-1. This study is the first to test Illuminare-1 in people. Illuminare-1 has received Fast Track designation from the US FDA.

Testing RG1-VLP Vaccine to Prevent HPV-related Cancers This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of RG1-virus-like particle (VLP) in preventing human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers in women. RG1-VLP is a vaccine that aims to protect against rare HPV types not targeted by currently approved HPV vaccines. HPV is a common sexually-transmitted infection that can cause certain genital and oral cancers. RG1-VLP contains a protein of HPV type 16 (HPV16) with a slightly different structure than the licensed Gardasil-9 vaccine. Gardasil-9 is approved by the Federal Drug Administration to help protect against diseases caused by some types of HPV. Gardasil-9 also contains 9 different HPV proteins. Both vaccines contain alum to stimulate the immune system. The usual approach for the prevention of HPV-related cancers for patients who are at increased risk is to consider the currently approved HPV vaccine like Gardasil-9, as well as to be followed closely by their doctor to watch for the development of cancer via routine pap smears. This trial may allow researchers to find out whether the RG1-VLP vaccine can safely trigger an immune response against HPV in healthy women and if it is better or worse than the usual approach for the prevention of HPV-related cancers.
The Impact of Antibiotic Prophylaxis on Incidence of Post-bronchoscopy Fever and Change of Serum Cytokines Fever can develop after fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) in about 2.5 - 16 % of adult patients.

FIT Families Multicomponent Obesity Intervention for African American Adolescents Obesity is one of the most prevalent medical problems facing children and adolescents today, particularly among African American adolescents where the rate is alarmingly high. This study will test the effectiveness of FIT Families, a multicomponent family-based behavioral intervention that is culturally tailored to meet the unique needs of African American adolescents with obesity and their caregivers, against a credible attention control condition. This study has considerable public health relevance because it is delivered by Community Health Workers, maximizing the potential for the intervention to be sustained, and may reduce obesity-related health problems for a vulnerable population of adolescents.
Cognitive Regulation Training and Exercise Trial The purpose of this double-blinded, randomized controlled study is to compare CORTEX (Cognitive Regulation Training and Exercise), a multi-faceted, center- and home-delivered- general and exercise-specific-active and traditional computerized cognitive training (CT) program to an attention-control condition involving health and wellness informational videos. More specifically, the cognitive training group will emphasize dual-task abilities, working memory, and visual-spatial processing, as well as self-as-exerciser priming and self-certainty training. It is hypothesized that early intervention cognitive training will enhance use of self-regulatory strategies and self-efficacy and in turn, increase exercise adherence to and engagement in a 12-month aerobic and resistive exercise program at a local fitness facility. More positive improvements in cognitive and psychosocial functioning among participants in the CORTEX condition (relative to the Video Attention-Control condition, i.e., health educational videos), are also expected immediately following the cognitive training, and across time. Expectancies and knowledge of study purpose (blinding integrity) will also be measured and used to statistically adjust for any training differences.

Intermittent Antimalaria Treatment With SP in African Children - intermittent preventive treatment with SP in children to evaluate efficacy and safety of this drug combination in children in northern Ghana
Sprint Interval Training in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Exercise therapy is a cornerstone in the management of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD), and supervised walking exercise three times a week over 12 weeks improves walking ability and quality of life. Despite this, very few patients exercise on a regular basis. The underuse of exercise in COPD patients can partly be explained by discomfort during exercise because it evokes dyspnea, and thereby explain lack of participation in exercise. If the goal is to offer the best medical therapy to these patients, new and effective exercise training methods must be explored and defined since exercise training is an important part of pulmonary rehabilitation.  Intention is to study a new training method called sprint interval training (SIT), which consists of high intensity bouts with very short duration. The idea behind SIT is to avoid the dyspnea associated with traditional endurance training, thus maximizing exercise power without excessive discomfort. The investigators will study training adaptations in patients with COPD and compare the results with age-matched controls.  It is expected that both COPD-patients and healthy elderly will improve exercise cycle time until exhaustion after SIT training, and also that the improvement will be larger in the healthy group due to higher absolute training intensity.
An Investigation of Performance and Safety of the Wound Dressing FibDex in Patients With Superficial Dermal Burns This is a prospective, randomised, open-label, within-patient controlled, non-inferiority clinical investigation of the nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) wound dressing FibDex® for treatment of superficial dermal burns in paediatric and adult patients. The clinical performance and safety of FibDex® will be compared to Epicitehydro (QRSKIN GmbH, Würzburg, Germany) and Epiprotect® (S2Medical AB, Linköping, Sweden). Epicitehydro is considered to be the primary comparator. The investigation will be conducted at 2 clinical research sites in Sweden.
Pentostatin, Cyclophosphamide, and Rituximab in Treating Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Other B-cell Cancers RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells.  PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in treating patients who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other B-cell cancers that have been treated previously.
Intra and Inter- Observer Reproducibility of Ankle Dorsiflexion Measure With a New Tool The Achilles' tendon is the largest and most resistant tendon in the body. When the triceps contracts, the Achilles' tendon is responsible for plantar flexion of the ankle. When the triceps are not contracted, the Achilles tendon is the main component in limiting dorsiflexion of the ankle, a major component of the gait pattern. The limitation of this dorsiflexion of the ankle can be caused by a shortening of the Achilles tendon.  This equine whose prevalence in the general population is greater than 50% according to Kowalski, appears to be a risk factor in many pathologies of the foot and ankle.  Currently, in clinical practice, the measurement of passive dorsiflexion of the ankle is empirically measured by the Silfverskiold test. However, the definition of a retraction varies according to the authors, in particular because of the absence of normalization of the force applied on the forefoot, or of the absence of uniformization of the angulation applied. This research is based on the hypothesis that a new measurement tool would be more efficient and more reproducible for measuring dorsiflexion of the ankle.
SMS Messaging for Invitation in the Cervical Cancer Screening Programme A study on two different methods of invitation to participate to the cervical cancer screening programme will be conducted within a demonstration project to switch from cytology-based screening to HPV-based screening using self-sampling delivered through the network of pharmacy offices among regular screening attendants in the Barcelona Metropolitana Sud Area, in Catalonia.  At the moment, eligible women are invited to participate to cervical cancer screening via a telephone call invitation explaining the new self-sampling method. Invitation via SMS containing a link to a webpage with information on most frequent questions might be an adequate alternative method that would save costs and workload on human resources.  The aim of this study is to assess the impact on cervical cancer screening participation of an invitation method based on text messaging (SMS).  The invitation method will be evaluated through an interventional trial, in which we will compare the invitation to cervical cancer screening using SMS versus a telephone call invitation explaining the new self-sampling method.
Efficacy and Safety of Coblopasvir Hydrochloride Capsules Combined With Sofosbuvir Tablets for the Treatment of Chronic HCV Infection: A Prospective, Multi-center Real-world Study. Chronic hepatitis C is a long-lasting infectious disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). According to statistics by the World Health Organization (WHO), the global HCV prevalence is estimated at 2.8%, equating to approximately 185 million. Chronic HCV infection can lead to chronic inflammatory necrosis and fibrosis in the liver, and in some patients can develop into hepatic cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), endangering the health and life of patients.  The development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) since 2011 markedly improved antiviral efficacy and significantly shortened treatment cycle, making the drugs convenient for clinical use. Small molecule DAAs exert target-specific effects on proteins involved in the HCV life cycle and have been included in the treatment guidelines by leading associations for the study of liver diseases worldwide.  Treatment regimen for hepatitis C - coblopasvir hydrochloride capsules combined with sofosbuvir tablets:  Coblopasvir hydrochloride capsule is an NS5A inhibitor that inhibits the replication and assembly of HCV, and sofosbuvir tablet is a NS5B polymerase inhibitor. The primary efficacy results (sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment, SVR12) were comparable between the phase II and III clinical studies: the overall SVR12 in subjects was 97%. The SVR12 after coblopasvir hydrochloride capsules combined with sofosbuvir tablets in genotype 3 infection with cirrhosis and genotype 3b infection with cirrhosis were superior to the results of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir tablets obtained in clinical studies in Asia (83% vs. 72%; 67% vs. 50%).  Coblopasvir hydrochloride capsule and sofosbuvir tablet were approved for marketing by National Medical Products Administration of China in Feb. 2020 and Mar. 2020, respectively. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of coblopasvir hydrochloride capsules combined with sofosbuvir tablets in clinical practice after marketing.

COUREUR Study Myocardial Inflammation in Cyclist Part 1 The study will evaluate myocardial inflammation in cyclists after high intense and sustained exercise. Our hypothesis is that strenuous exercise in recreational cyclists may be associated with myocardial inflammation. Myocardial fibrosis in asymptomatic athletes is associated with life-threatening arrhythmic events and sudden death. Although myocarditis seems to be the most likely underlying cause, it remains unclear if strenuous and sustained physical exercise can cause myocardial inflammation with development of myocyte necrosis and possibly myocardial fibrosis in athletes.  Nineteen recreational cyclists performing "L'ETAPE DU TOUR (EDT) de France" a cycling ride (175 km, 3600 m of positive altitude difference) on July 4 2021 will be included in this study.  In part 1 of the study, each participant will complete a detailed questionnaire detailing their training history and an echocardiography at rest will be performed. All participants will have exercise testing approximately 1 week before the EDT stage to set aerobic and anaerobic gas exchange thresholds, as well as VO2max.

As a secondary aim, we will test for preliminary evidence of efficacy of autologous fat vs. HA and determine how these treatments effect the biochemical environment of the knee by comparing pre-injection and post-injection synovial fluid biomarker profiles.
Screening of Alberta Asbestos Exposed Workers for Lung Cancer and Mesothelioma Asbestos defines a group of naturally occurring mineral silicate fibers which are easily inhaled, resulting in a variety of diseases of the respiratory system including lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact on overall survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part because patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. This study aims to develop and implement a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening approach for lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta.
Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome Nerve entrapment as a cause of chronic abdominal pain is frequently overlooked. A series of nerves pass through the muscles of the abdomen before reaching the skin to carry sensations. They can get trapped within the muscles leading to severe pain resulting in a condition known as Abdominal Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (ACNES). ACNES affects between 10-30% of patients with chronic abdominal wall pain. A definitive diagnosis of ACNES is obtained by anaesthetising these nerves. Initial management includes education and avoidance of known triggers. It is common practice to inject steroid with local anaesthetic during the diagnostic injections itself to prolong pain relief. Like other nerve entrapment conditions, this is also refractory to medical treatment. Hence repeated injections and nerve entrapment release surgery are commonly carried out.  In Aberdeen, a number of patients have been treated for this condition. A cohort of patients have benefitted with injection alone while recurrence has been noted in patients who have undergone surgery. This project aims to gain more understanding about the clinical course of patients with suspected ACNES by evaluation of the clinic progress.

Ensartinib, Carboplatin, Pemetrexed and Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Stage IIIC or IV or Recurrent ALK-Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer This phase Ib trial finds the best dose and side effects of ensartinib and its effects when given with carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab for in treating patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer that is stage IIIC or IV, or has come back (recurrent). Ensartinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ensartinib, carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab may help to control the disease.
Characterization of Two Novel Mutations in the Apob Gene The pilot study has the target to evaluate the outcomes of two novel mutations in the gene of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB). ApoB is the main part of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to the periphery. The two novel mutations lead to a heavily truncated Apolipoprotein B. Therefore the patients show severely decreased ApoB and LDL-Cholesterol levels. The acquired disease is known as "Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia". Beside the protection from cardiovascular disease due to decreased LDL-Cholesterol, patients tend to show elevated serum aminotransferases, fatty liver and occasional cases of cirrhosis and carcinoma.  To elucidate the differences in lipoprotein assembly the investigators aim to characterize the changes due to the mutations in the patients. Family members not carrying the mutations are the control group. The assessment includes lipoprotein fractionation, MRI scans of the liver and a thorough assessment of medical history of all patients to look for potential side effects of the mutation.  The only intervention needed for the study is to draw blood samples of every participant. The necessary positive vote from the ethics committee of the Medical University of Innsbruck is given.

Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy With or Without Concurrent Chemotherapy for Stage II Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma A prior phase III randomized trial showed considerable survival benefit from the combined treatment of cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy and two-dimensional conventional radiotherapy (2DCRT) for patients with stage II (the Chinese 1992 staging system) nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, since intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was known to be superior to 2DCRT in local control, progression free survival and even overall survival, it is a pivotal question whether stage II \[T1N1M0 and T2N0-1M0, based on the 2010 International Union against Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system\] patients can still obtain significant benefit from the additional concurrent chemotherapy in the IMRT era.  The investigators' retrospective study (PMID:26528755 ) indicated that low risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T1N1M0, T2N0-1M0 or T3N0M0, the 2010 UICC/AJCC staging system) patients who underwent IMRT could not benefit from cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy. Therefore, the investigators perform this randomized controlled trial to address this question, on a prudent assumption that IMRT alone was not inferior to IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy in stage II patients.

A Clinical Trial of Study Medicine (Marstacimab) in Pediatric Patients With Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine (called marstacimab) for the potential treatment of hemophilia in pediatric patients.  This study will enroll pediatric participants from ages 1 to 17 years in a sequential manner. The study will open enrollment to adolescent participants aged 12 to 17 years first. Then children aged 6 to 11 years will be permitted to enroll. Lastly, children aged 1 to 5 years will be permitted to enroll.  This study will enroll participants who:  * have severe Hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe Hemophilia B (with or without inhibitors) * have accurate historical records documenting all factor VIII, factor IX, or bypass agent infusions and hemophilia bleed events for at least 1 year prior to entering the study * if a non-inhibitor patient, must be on a stable routine prophylaxis regimen with factor VIII or factor IX replacement products for at least 12 months prior to study entry * if an inhibitor patient, must be on an on-demand bypass treatment regimen during the 12 months prior to study entry  All participants in this study will receive marstacimab to use prophylactically. Marstacimab will be given once a week as a subcutaneous (under the skin) shot. The first dose of marstacimab will be given at the study site by the study site staff. During the 12-month treatment period, weekly doses of marstacimab can be given at home, or if preferred, the doses may be given by the study site staff.  To help us determine if the study medicine is safe and effective, we will compare participant experiences when they are taking the study medicine to a historical period when they were not. Researchers want to see if the study medicine works to prevent the bleeding episodes commonly experienced by patients with Hemophilia.  Participants will be in this study for about 14 months (approximately 1 month in a Screening period, 12 months receiving treatment, and 1 month in a follow-up period) during which they will visit the study site at least 10 times. If preferred, and if local regulations allow it, 2 of the study visits can be completed at the participant's home instead of at the study site. There will also be 6 scheduled telephone calls approximately every 2 months.
Measurment of Interleuukin-6 at Exhaled Breath Condensate of Covid-19 Patients and Post Covid-19 Patients With Lung Fibrosis Randomized Controlled Study COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. It is mainly manifested as pneumonia which may deteriorate into severe respiratory failure. The major hallmark of the disease is the systemic inflammatory immune response characterized by Cytokine Storm (CS). CS is marked by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Of these, IL-6 is found to be significantly associated with higher mortality. IL-6 is also a robust marker for predicting disease prognosis and deterioration of clinical profile. (1) IL-6 was detectable in the breath condensate of all the healthy non-smokers, but was significantly higher in the COPD patient. Exhaled breath condensate is totally non-invasive and highly acceptable to patients. The collection procedure has no effect on airway function or inflammation, and there is growing evidence that abnormalities in condensate composition may reflect biochemical changes in airway lining fluid. This method has been successfully used in previous studies to investigate several inflammatory markers in COPD and asthmatic patients. (2) Il-6 is produced in the lung by interstitial fibroblasts, alveolar macrophages, and large-vessel and bronchial epithelial cells. IL-6 levels are high in chronic inflammatory conditions of the lung, such as those due to allogeneic transplantation, bleomycin-induced fibrosis and a variety of human interstitial lung diseases. High levels of IL-6 have been found in the induced sputum of patients with COPD, particularly during exacerbation. Park et al. found increased IL-6 levels in the Bronchioalveolar lavage fluid of patients with non-specific interstitial pneumonia/fibrosis and in some patients with interstitial pneumonia. (3) the study involved 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with moderate to severe covid-19 according to cdc classifaction and 20 patients post covid-19 with lung fibrosis to estimate the measurment of interleukin-6 at exhaled condensate, this clinical randomized control study consists of 3 arms for 6 month ( all participants above 18 years non prgnant humans )

a Study to Evaluate Adhesion Risk in Fertility Patients' Status Post Laparoscopic Myomectomy. Premenopausal Women ages 18-42 will undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy. Prior to the myomectomy, adhesions will be assessed using a modified AFS scoring technique. All investigators will provide usual and customary care to research subjects during the first look laparoscopy. This includes the use of all standard practice anti-adhesive agents and heparinized irrigation fluids.V-Loc 180 suture will be utilized in all patients. All patients will then be evaluated by means of a second look laparoscopy (SLL) 6-12 weeks after the initial surgery and reevaluated via modified American Fertility Society scoring techniques. An independent reviewer will also score adhesions utilize a video recording made from the second look laparoscopic surgery. Patients will be contacted both 1 and 4 weeks post -op and assessed for complications. It is the expectation that patients will show no greater post-operative adhesion formation and a \<1% complication rate. Time and ease of suturing will also be evaluated. It is expected that the V-Loc suturing technique will show significantly reduced suturing time, be easier to use, and will be associated with minimal adhesions.

But whether mastoidectomy in addition to tympanoplasty is really necessary in each and every case of quiescent chronic otitis media still remains controversial. Hence this study has been undertaken to study the differences in the outcomes of the 2 surgical procedures performed for chronic otitis media in a randomized control design.
Impact on Atrial Remodeling of Dapaglifozin in Patients With Heart Failure . Dapagliflozin reduces the risk of de novo heart failure (HF) in diabetics and, recently, it has shown to improve the prognosis of patients with HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), by preventing HF decompensations and cardiovascular death. The benefit showed by dapagliflozin in HFrEF was irrespective of diabetes status and glycemic control, which raises the question of which mechanisms are underlying apart from SGLT2 inhibition. In addition, the impact of dapagliflozin on cardiac remodeling parameters, as assessed by echocardiography and biomarkers, is not well established. In particular, left atrial (LA) remodeling represents a relevant prognostic marker, which has received a greater attention in the last years in the context of new imaging tools.  The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of dapagliflozin therapy over a period of 6 months in LA remodeling parameters, including geometry and function, as well as complementary biomarkers in patients with chronic HF regardless left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This protocol will allow for evaluation of improved understanding of the interplay between dapagliflozin and LA function , biomarkers, remodeling and outcomes, and will carefully assess such relationships within important cohorts of subjects, such as those with reduced and preserved LVEF.  This protocol will also generate a biorepository of well-handled and carefully considered biomarkers, which will allow a better understanding of dapagliflozin mechanism of action.

To determine whether there is any additive toxicity with combined use of sCD4-PE40 and zidovudine (AZT).  There is some evidence that AZT and sCD4-PE40, an experimental drug with anti-HIV activity previously demonstrated in vitro, may produce increased benefit when used in combination in HIV-infected patients.
Triglyceride Effects on Blood Flow in the Human Brain The 'Western diet' characterized by high fat feeding (HFF) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, little is known about mechanisms. Paradoxically, individuals who carry the AD risk gene APOE E4 cognitively improve after HFF and show different metabolic responses to fat intake. These responses include a more pronounced drop in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lactate levels. This proposal will further examine the brain metabolic response to HFF using non-invasive imaging. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) as assessed by functional MRI is increasingly utilized to investigate brain function, given that CBF is tightly coupled to brain metabolism. Acute changes in CBF have been described in response to carbohydrate ingestion in regions important for learning and memory; however, no one has yet assessed CBF response to lipid. Here investigators propose to characterize CBF changes to a high fat drink in older adults. This study will include a time course assessment as well as analyses of global and regional change in CBF. These data would serve as feasibility pilot data for an R01 application which would include cognitive and peripheral metabolic data. These types of studies will provide a clearer picture of acute brain metabolic response to HFF in older adults, including the effects of APOE.
Facing Fears In-session or Out-session? Anxiety problems are a major concern of youth mental health given that the prevalence of anxiety disorders in Dutch children aged up to 12 is approximately 4 to 8 percent. In this group, specific phobias are among the most common. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with exposure as its key ingredient, takes a prominent place in national guidelines for the treatment of anxiety disorders. These guidelines are based on empirical support that exposure is effective in the treatment of specific phobia. Yet, despite the empirical evidence of its efficacy, a gap between theory and practice remains, with exposure-based CBT being underused in clinical practice. For example, a recent Dutch survey found that exposure was mostly practiced outside the formal therapy sessions as homework assignment. It is questionable whether this is effective, given that it might be hard for children to do these assignments independently (e.g., without the help of a therapist or their parents). This study therefore proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of different degrees of therapist and parent involvement during exposure, comparing therapist supported exposure with self-supported exposure with and without the use of parents as co-therapists.
Large-scale Expansion and Characterization of Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Clinical Application According to many recent research, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated from synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat pad have higher ex vivo proliferation capacity, multipotency and ability to undergo chondrogenesis.  Based on this concept, the investigators plan to get two removed tissues (synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat pad) from patients who have an operation of total knee replacement. The investigators are going to isolate and expand MSC from these two tissues respectively, and then compare the chondrogenesis ability for clinical application. In the other hand, the investigators plan to build techniques and procedures which comply with "Good Tissue Practices (GTP)"

Safety/Efficacy of AVP-923 in the Treatment of Emotional Lability (Uncontrolled Crying & Laughing) in Patients With ALS The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the safety of AVP-923 (dextromethorphan/quinidine) for the treatment of emotional lability in ALS patients.
REWARD SYSTEM RESPONSES TO FOOD AROMAS Food aromas are a part of foods' flavor, and can promote overeating. Alcohol consumption also stimulates appetite, and contributes to overeating while under alcohol's acute effects. Knowing the brain regions that respond to food aromas and alcohol, and how they are modified by the amount of body fat and alcohol exposure, will provide critical information about the neural systems that underlie loss of control of eating. Therefore, the main hypotheses of this study are that: A) Lean and obese subjects have different brain responses to food aromas that enhance desire to eat, and B) Acute alcohol intoxication i) enhances the brain's response to food odors, and ii) affects brain systems that inhibit or terminate eating. To test these hypotheses, we have modified functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms successfully used to study alcoholic drink aromas in subjects at risk for alcoholism.
Rural Tailored Communication to Promote SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing in Saliva This study seeks to evaluate communication strategies for better encouraging understanding and uptake of salivary SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among individuals residing in rural Northern Michigan.

Veliparib and Irinotecan Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Cancer That Is Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or that cannot be removed by surgery. Irinotecan hydrochloride can kill cancer cells by damaging the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is needed for cancer cell survival and growth. Veliparib may block proteins that repair the damaged DNA and may help irinotecan hydrochloride to kill more tumor cells. Giving irinotecan hydrochloride together with veliparib may kill more cancer cells.

The Interaction Between Measles and DTP Vaccination The purpose of this study is to investigate for the broad immunological effects of administering measles vaccine (MV) and diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) to 9 month old Gambian infants, either alone or together. Effects on vaccine-specific immune responses, innate immunity, and immune memory were studied. The hypothesis is that when MV and DTP are given together there will be more inflammation and this will interfere with generation of immunity to the vaccine and to other non-vaccine related stimuli.
Gestational Diabetes: a Cohort Study Gestational diabetes (GDM) is the most common hormonal complication during pregnancy. Its occurrence implies an increased risk of maternal and fetal complications and, therefore, its diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. Since the adoption of the new diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) in 2010, an increasing number of cases of mild hyperglycemia have demanded follow-up and treatment. The need and benefit of treatment in these cases of mild hyperglycemia has been discussed worldwide. Women who have been diagnosed with GDM are at increased risk for type 2 DM in the years following gestation. Other factors (such as lipid profile, obesity, adipokine dosage) may also be related to the repercussions of GDM on the maternal-fetal binomial, since gestations with satisfactory glycemic control can also present complications related to the disease and increased risk of type 2 DM in the long term. The present study aims to investigate factors associated with the need for insulin use, the occurrence of perinatal complications, nutritional status, physical activity and weight retention one year after delivery and the postpartum diagnosis of type 2 DM 10 years after delivery in women diagnosed with GDM according to the current criteria suggested by the IADPSG.
A Prospective, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Atrasentan, Including Thoracic Bioimpedance, in Type 2 Diabetic Subjects With Nephropathy Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Design, Placebo-Controlled Multicenter Study. The study objectives are to evaluate efficacy and safety, including thoracic bioimpedance, of once daily administration of atrasentan tablets (high dose and low dose) compared to placebo in type 2 diabetic subjects with nephropathy who are receiving the maximum tolerated labeled daily dose of a RAS inhibitor.
Gastrectomy, Eating Behaviour and GLP-1 Patients who have undergone gastrectomy (removal of the stomach) to treat or prevent cancer are known to have a significantly reduced quality of life. To date, there is very little information on the physiological causes of this. The investigators suspect that overproduction of a hormone (chemical) called glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released by the lining of the gut may play a role in the reduced appetite, weight loss and low blood sugar symptoms seen in this group. To investigate this, the investigators will study the response of 16 patients who have previously had a gastrectomy to a glucose drink, and a meal, while receiving an infusion of a specific blocker of GLP-1 or placebo. The investigators will examine the levels of sugar and associated hormones in the blood, food consumption and food reward behaviour using standard tools.  Participants will be invited to attend the Clinical Research Facility at Addenbrooke's Hospital for a screening visit, and two whole day study visits. The study has been designed to assess the role of overproduction of GLP-1 by completely blocking its actions, rather than assess the use of the blocking compound as a medication, and is therefore regarded as a physiological study, not a clinical trial.  The goal of this study is to demonstrate the magnitude of effect of GLP-1 on blood sugar and appetite derangement in patients who have had a gastrectomy. This will guide future work on the development of novel treatment paradigms for the post-gastrectomy patient group.
Achieving Portal Access With Scorpion Post-Approval Study (APASS) Creation of the parenchymal tract between the portal vein and the hepatic vein is the most difficult and time consuming step in a TIPS procedure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate portal vein access sets during the TIPS procedure.
Nanodisk-MS Assay for the Diagnosis of Active Pulmonary and Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis in Hospitalized Patients Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis are often delayed in hospitalized patients, leading to worse outcomes. Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis currently relies on microscopy and molecular techniques, which have limitations including low sensitivity and high cost.Highly sensitive diagnostic technique is needed for more accurate rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis to aid earlier initiation of antituberculous therapy. Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) antigens in the bloodstream can potentially allow early diagnosis of tuberculosis. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a novel assay using nanotechnology to detect MTB antigens in patients admitted to hospital with suspected pulmonary and/or extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Blood will be taken from eligible patients, and will be sent to the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, for detection of 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) and the 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6), two antigens specific for MTB, using the Nanodisk-MS assay. Investigations, including microscopy, culture, MTB polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and imaging, will be performed for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The diagnostic performance of Nanodisk-mass spectrometry (MS) assay will be evaluated.

Safety and Efficacy of Gabapentin in Postherpetic Neuralgia Gabapentin and pregabalin are treatments for some types of neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). However, these treatments usually need to be taken 3 times a day for effective pain control. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new gabapentin tablet, which only needs to be taken once a day, is safe and effective for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.
PET/CT: Role in Detecting Unknown Primary Head and Neck Cancer Historically metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in a cervical lymph node from an occult primary malignancy of the head and neck was evaluated with panendoscopy and biopsies of high risk areas, such as the base of tongue, nasopharynx, and tonsils. This diagnostic protocol identifies the primary malignancy in about 50% of cases. In recent years, the availability of CT has slightly increased the detection rate to 65% when used as an adjunct to the traditional work-up. Studies using PET as an adjunct are conflicting with detection rates ranging up to 75%. Currently, no prospective study has analyzed the role of the PET-CT fusion in the work-up of an occult primary malignancy of the head and neck. This study will compare the detection rate of the traditional work-up to a new protocol involving a pre-operative diagnostic PET-CT.

Substudy : Patients With an Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its prevalence is in progression and COPD is expected to become the fourth leading cause of death by 2030. COPD is characterized by periods of stability interspersed with acute infectious/inflammatory flare-ups, also called acute exacerbations, during which patients deteriorate, sometimes to the point of requiring immediate medical assistance. Although most patients eventually recover, repeated episodes of exacerbations may accelerate COPD progression. Exacerbations may further compromise the integrity of limb muscles by promoting further loss in muscle mass and strength.  The overall objective of this substudy is to elucidate how an acute COPD exacerbation may affect limb muscles.

Comparison of Tendon Transfer, Botox Injections and Ongoing Treatment in Hemiplegic Cerebral Palsy Doctors use different treatments for people with Cerebral Palsy. Surgery is one option. Botulinum toxin injections are another option; these are given directly into spastic muscles to weaken them temporarily. Regular ongoing treatment (splinting, stretching and exercises) is another option. The investigators want to find out if surgery works better than Botulinum Toxin (Botox) injections or regular ongoing treatment (therapy), and if the effects of Botulinum Toxin injections last for longer than six months.
Feasibility Assessment of Risk Stratification and Oral Challenge in Hospitalized Children at Low Risk for Antibiotic Allergy Children are often reported to have antibiotics allergies, with approximately 10% of the US population labeled as allergic to an antibiotic. Recent studies have demonstrated that a large majority of children with a penicillin allergy label do not have a true IgE-mediated allergy. Appropriately delabeling antibiotic allergies has been shown to improve patient care outcomes and lower health care costs. However, efforts to implement these assessments in practice are lacking, particularly in the hospital setting. Therefore, there is a need for hospital-based risk assessment and delabeling strategies for hospitalized children. The investigator's objective is to determine the feasibility of implementing a hospital-based approach to penicillin allergy risk stratification and evaluation of patients at low-risk for true allergy.
Long Term Implications of Rare Brain Tumours' Patients diagnosed with oligodendroglioma with a specific molecular profile represent rare tumour groups (about 10% of adult gliomas) with relatively favourable prognosis (median survival between 8 and 12 years). These patients are often treated with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. However, as patients live for a long period of time, they may also experience long-term toxic side-effects of treatment. The long-term consequences of treatment- and disease-related factors on quality of life and cognitive functioning of these patients are largely unknown. This study aims to investigate quality of life and cognitive functioning in long-term survivors of oligodendroglioma (with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion). This knowledge can support health care professionals prepare patients for any long-term consequences of treatment.

Nut Allergy Study: Double-blind Challenge and Oral Desensitization Nut sensitization in skin prick tests is common in areas, including Finland, where birch pollen is abundant. However, sensitization to nuts in skin prick test does not predict the possibility of allergic symptoms when nuts are ingested. In this study the investigators launch and perform double-blind placebo-controlled nut challenges and oral desensitization/ protocol to those with serious symptoms in the challenge. The efficacy and safety of the new oral desensitization program is the primary outcome. The effect of oral desensitization on bronchial hyperreactivity, eosinophilic airway inflammation, and quality of life are secondary outcomes.
Exercise to Prevent Muscle Mass and Functional Loss in Elderly Dialysis Patients The majority of individuals with advanced ESRD have reduced exercise capacity in part due to decreased muscle mass. This leads to a reduced ability to perform daily activities, a greater incidence of falls, and a reduced quality of life. The mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle mass in ESRD are not understood very well. This study is designed to determine the effectiveness of an exercise program on improving muscle mass, exercise capacity and quality of life in persons with ESRD. In addition, the study will attempt to better understand why muscle loss occurs in people with ESRD, the influence exercise has on these mechanisms, and whether the response to exercise can be enhanced with nutrient supplementation.
Optimal Anti-tachycardia Therapy in Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Patients Without Pacing Indications This study evaluates the impact of a new pacing mode avoiding unnecessary ventricular stimulation in combination with advanced dual chamber detection with slow VT management on the clinical outcome for hospitalization and mortality and inadequate therapy in medically stable, ICD-indicated patients with impaired left ventricular function (LVEF ≤ 40%) who do not have pacing indications and no indication for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). It compares a new pacing mode avoiding ventricular stimulation when not needed combined with dual chamber detection with a pure ventricular back up pacing and single chamber detection criteria with pure ventricular back up pacing. Therapies are compared in a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, parallel trial with a 24-month randomized treatment period. Randomization follows a 1:1 ratio. ICD therapy is enabled for all patients throughout the study. All patients receive optimal drug therapy for arrhythmia and heart failure treatment.

Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Biofilm Infection and Recurrence Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most common reasons for hospitalization of diabetic patients and frequently results in amputation of lower limbs. Of the one million people who undergo non-traumatic leg amputations annually worldwide, 75% are performed on people who have type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The risk of death at 10 years for a diabetic with DFU is twice as high as the risk for a patient without a DFU. The rate of amputation in patients with DFU is 38.4%4. Infection is a common (\>50%) complication of DFU. Emerging evidence underscores the significant risk that biofilm infection poses to the non-healing DFU. Biofilms are estimated to account for 60% of chronic wound infections. In the biofilm form, bacteria are in a dormant metabolic state. Thus, standard clinical techniques like the colony forming unit (CFU) assay to detect infection may not detect biofilm infection. Thus, biofilm infection may be viewed as a silent maleficent threat in wound care.
Eeva System Imaging Study The purpose of this clinical trial is to collect imaging data on embryos followed to blastocyst stage (Day 5-6) for ongoing development and validation of the Eeva System.
Causes of Low Digestive Bleeding in Proctology The various causes of bleeding Proctological are well known to gastroenterologists in clinical practice but their proportions have not, to our knowledge, been dedicated epidemiological studies. Investigators wanted to evaluate this data as part of a specialized consultation. Investigators have prospectively collected the causes of gastrointestinal bleeding down the patients seen two of us in specialized proctology center. A clinical examination including an inspection, palpation and feel, and a anoscopy (when possible) were made during the consultation. Local levies referred (s) histological and / or infection were also carried out if necessary. When she had not been made, a colonic exploration was offered to all patients over 45 years and / or when indicated by the pathological context. When there were several possible causes, the clinician holding one that seemed to be the main. Patients consulting within four months postoperatively a proctology action were not included. The study period extended from September 2013 to July 2014 inclusive. The collection of anonymous data.

During routine clinic visit after 34 weeks, prospective patients will be counseled about the study. Patients who agree to be enrolled, will sign informed consent. Following enrollment, patients will be screened for BV. Those patients who are BV positive by clinical diagnosis, will be randomized to receive either metronidazole 500 mg BID orally for 7 days or identically appearing placebo.
A Post Discharge Intervention to Improve Stroke Outcomes The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive interdisciplinary post-discharge stroke care management intervention in improving the overall well-being of 190 stroke survivors as compared to 190 patients who receive usual post-discharge stroke care.
Proteomics and Radiomics Research of Breast Cancer Markers in Tissue, Interstitial Fluid and Serum The current study is a case control study involving comparisons of tissue interstitial fluid from breast cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue as well as that from benign breast lesion and its adjacent non-diseased tissue for a distinguishable breast cancer profile. The purpose of this research is to collect fresh breast nodule/cancer and surrounding non-cancerous tissue for proteomic studies of the interstitial fluid to identify a profile distinguishing breast cancer which will also permit future research on stored interstitial fluid, blood or tissue samples. Specific markers identified from interstitial fluid study will be investigated in blood samples to develop serum markers for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Additionally, we will perform both prospective and retrospective research on breast cancer involving clinical, demographic, epidemiologic information, treatment, follow-up and outcomes on breast nodule/cancer cases collected.
Pharmacokinetics Study of GSK1265744 in Subjects With Severe Renal Impairment GSK1265744 (744) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently in development for both the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Renal elimination of unchanged 744 is extremely low, with no parent 744 detected in the urine after a single 30 mg radiolabeled dose. Despite the minimal contribution of renal clearance on overall 744 elimination, renal impairment may potentially inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport, and as a result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics. The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies suggests that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment be conducted even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile.  The study will be comprised of two cohorts (severe renal impairment and normal renal function) of 8 subjects each. Upon enrolment, each subject will be admitted to the study center and undergo serial PK sampling following a single dose of oral 744 30 milligrams (mg). Subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluations 10-14 days after the 744 30 mg dose.
Whole-Body Vibration for Functional Constipation 1. Aim: The aim of this trial was to determine whether whole-body vibration (WBV) induced via a non-invasive oscillation platform could improve symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic functional constipation. 2. Methods: A single-blinded, randomized, control trial was performed in a single Hospital in Taiwan. Patients diagnosed with chronic functional constipation, as per the Rome III diagnostic criteria were included and randomized to either the WBV treatment or no treatment (control) group. The treatment group received six 15-minute sessions of WBV therapy over a two-week period. Patients received vibrations of 2 mm in amplitude at a frequency of 12 Hz. The primary outcome was assessed by the constipation severity instrument (CSI). The secondary outcome was improvements in HRQOL.

Morphological and Functional Evaluation of Adult Flat Foot Before and After Corrective Surgery Morphological weight bearing computed tomography parameters and gait analysis can implement the evaluation of the flat foot. Weight bearing CT is useful to verify the severity of the 3D deformities typical of flat foot, while kinematic and kinetic variables of gait is able to quantify the functional improvements of the foot after surgery.
CO2 vs. Air Insufflation for Endoscopic Ultrasound The insufflation of air in the viscera is indispensable during endoscopy. However, the distension of the bowel that follows is often the cause of abdominal discomfort.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been widely used for insufflation in endoscopy. CO2 insufflation is demonstrated in the literature to cause lower abdominal discomfort as it is quickly reabsorbed by the body.  Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a method in which you associate the endoscopic view and the ultrasound vision obtained from the inside of the viscera.  The diagnostic accuracy of EUS is undermined by the visual artifacts caused by the presence of air between the probe and the organ to be studied.  Although the use of CO2 is already widely applied by many endoscopists, there are no studies to date concerning the use of CO2 during EUS from the point of view of the abdominal discomfort related to the procedure and/or the quality of the images obtained.  The main purpose of the study is to assess whether the insufflation of CO2 results in a reduction of discomfort of the patients undergoing EUS. The study design is observational because no randomization or other interventions are planned; participants will be assigned to either air or CO2 insufflation according to the endoscopic room equipment (one room is equipped with CO2 insufflation while another endoscopic room is equipped just with air insufflation) and the results of the two groups will be compared. Among the secondary goals the investigators want to evaluate whether insufflation of CO2 is associated with a reduction in the dose required for patients sedation. Finally, the investigators want to clarify whether the use of CO2 is able to produce less visual artifacts than air and thus improve the quality of EUS images.
Omeprazole and Famotidine in Chronic Dysfunction of the Transplanted Kidney The aim of the study is to compare the effect of omeprazole and famotidine on the risk of developing chronic renal transplant dysfunction. For the study, it is planned to qualify 24 stabilized adult patients from 1-24 months after kidney transplantation, who will receive p.o. the standard, most commonly used triple immunosuppression regimen: tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and depending on the group p.o.: omeprazole 20 mg (group I) or famotidine 20 mg (group II). The material in the study will be blood, in which tacrolimus concentrations will be measured at the following time points: 0, 2h, 6h, 12h after drug administration, without taking omeprazole/famotidine and then the next day after taking the protective drug in same time points, without 12h. Sequentially routinely in the so-called point T0 before taking the drug (12 hours after the last dose) during follow-up visits at the Transplant Outpatient Clinic. Tacrolimus concentrations will be determined using the Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immuno Assay method. As standard, laboratory tests will be performed during follow-up visits.  In addition, it is planned to assess titer of donor-specific antibodies at the time of qualification and then after 18 months, immunological profile (flow cytometry) at the time of qualification and then after 18 months, and concentration in serum and urine of a potential marker of progression and decrease in glomerular filtration - kidney injury molecule-1 at the time of qualification and then after 18 months. The obtained results will be correlated with the histopathological evaluation of the transplanted kidney in the case of organ biopsy performed on clinical indications.  Comparative statistical analysis of drug concentration values will be carried out. Additionally, genetic tests will be performed to assess the patient's metabolic variant for CYP2C19. Due to the potential influence of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, which may influence the process of chronic rejection of the transplanted kidney and drug toxicity, it seems important to study this hypothesis, as well as researching for therapeutic substances neutral to the above process. The use of famotidine in place of omeprazole may turn out more beneficial and safer for renal transplant patients. During follow-up visits at the Transplant Clinic at the Department and Clinic of Nephrology, Transplantology and Internal Diseases, changes in blood concentrations of tacrolimus are noticed. Related reasons are being looked for. The above study will confirm or reject the relationship of changes in tacrolimus levels with omeprazole. It is planned to present the results at a scientific conference. The research results will be published in a scientific journal.
Exercise and Diet Intervention Attenuated Inflammation Through ASC Gene and Inflammatory Markers in Obese Adults Background: Obesity is one of the most important health problems worldwide, several factors related to lifestyle as physical inactivity and unbalanced diets increase their development. This condition is characterized by low-chronic inflammation by excess of adipose tissue. The apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) protein is part of NLRP3 inflammasome, a complex related to inflammation and metabolic alterations.  Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of physical exercise program on ASC gene expression and inflammatory markers in obese adults.  Methods: 37 obese individuals were randomized to exercise-diet group or diet-group during a 4-month follow-up period. The dietary evaluation was analyzed by Nutritionist Pro software. Body composition was evaluated by bioimpedance (InBody 370). All biochemical determinations were analyzed by dry chemistry (Vitros 350). ASC messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taqman probes and by the 2-ΔΔcq quantification method. Cytokine levels was performed using the Bio-PlexPro™ HumanTh17Cytokine Assays (MagPix) panel. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.22 software.

A RCT to Establish the Effectiveness of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression to Prevent Post Stroke DVT Strokes occur when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted. Patients are often bedbound for several days or weeks although if they survive, most will make some recovery. The lack of mobility encourages blood clots to form in the legs - so called deep venous thrombosis or DVT. About 10% of patients will develop these. Pieces of this clot may break off and can be carried by the bloodstream to the lungs. These clots, called pulmonary emboli, can stop the heart and can cause patients with stroke to die suddenly. A treatment which reduces the risk of DVT after surgery is intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). Inflatable sleeves wrapped around the legs inflate at intervals squeezing blood up the legs, increasing the blood flow, and decreasing the likelihood of clots forming - at least that is the theory!. Although this sounds uncomfortable, most people actually quite like the sensation! There have been some small randomised trials of IPC in stroke patients, particularly those with intracerebral bleeding. However, these studies although encouraging have not provided enough information to persuade clinicians to use this treatment routinely in stroke units. The proposed study will include 2000 patients who have had a stroke and who have been admitted to a stroke unit.  Patients who cannot walk independently, and who are at greatest risk of DVT will be invited to join the study. If they agree they will be randomly allocated to having routine care plus IPC or just routine care. Patient in both groups will have routine ultrasound scans on their legs to detect DVTs. The study will establish whether IPC reduces the risk of DVT. This result could improve the outcome of many thousands of patients each year.
Sunitinib Before or After Surgery in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sunitinib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether sunitinib is more effective when given before or after surgery in treating kidney cancer.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of sunitinib and to compare how well it works when given before or after surgery in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.
Effect of Body Positioning on Upper Airway Patency During Induction of Anesthesia in Obese Patients Upper airway obstruction (UAO) during induction of general anesthesia is a frequently occurring complication. The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Obesity is major risk factors for OSA and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. The change of body position improved upper airway stability during sleep in patients with OSA.We hypothesis that the 30˚ reverse trendelenburg body position maintain airway patency in obese patients during general anesthesia.

Digital Interventions in Neuro-Rehabilitation: Gotcha! Aims and background Everyone forgets the names of people they should know at times. Having dementia makes this problem worse. People with dementia have told expressed they forget the names of people they care about and this can be upsetting and embarrassing.  However, evidence shows that if people get enough practice, they can re-learn these names. The investigators, along with people with dementia and their carers, have created a fun therapy for people to get lots of practice so they can remember the names of people that are important to them.  The main aim of the study is:  To prove that Gotcha! therapy can help people with dementia to improve their ability to remember names.  Another aim is:  To find out if using the therapy is related to any changes in the brains of people with dementia.  Design and methods Participants are provided with a computer tablet to practise at home. Participants are required to think of 6-10 familiar people (family and friends) whose names they forget and want to remember better.  Participants also need to practise every day for about 30 minutes over a 6 week period so they get a large amount of therapy.  Participants will have 7 testing appointments over 12 months. At three of these appointments participants will need to have a brain scan. These scans are carried out by trained University College London professionals and will take no longer than 30 minutes each.  For the appointments where participants do not need to have a brain scan home testing can be arranged.  The investigators organise and pay for all journeys to and from University College London.  Participants  Participants can get involved in our research if they:  * Have ever experiences seeing a familiar person but can't remember their name * Have a diagnosis of dementia (Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia). * Want to be part of an important and exciting research journey. Unfortunately a diagnosis of other any other types of dementia not mentioned above is not suitable for this study  Patient and Public involvement The investigators have engaged with people from the Alzheimer's Society and local dementia carers groups, run many focus groups and interviewed people with dementia and their carers to co-design the therapy.  At the end of our research participants are invited to University College London to learn about the results of the study.
Routine Use of Antiretroviral Therapy to Prevent Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission in the Kafue District of Zambia The investigators will enroll a cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women accessing PMTCT services, to better understand the incremental benefits (e.g. reduction in HIV transmission, improvements in HIV-free survival) and risks (e.g. drug toxicities) of the routine HAART strategy, in comparison to HIV-infected pregnant women accessing the Zambian Standard of Care services.  The investigators will test the hypothesis that routine use of HAART produces significant reductions in HIV transmission rates, with only minimal side effects.

Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation of Executive Deficits in Stroke Patients WHO: 32 participants with executive deficits related to a stroke, able to engage in moderate physical activity.  WHY: Around one third of stroke patients suffer from cognitive deficits in the long term, which have a detrimental impact on everyday personal and professional life. The purpose of this study is to evaluate two sets of computerized exercises combining cognitive and physical effort to see if they can improve executive function.  WHAT: Study participants first undergo cognitive and physical assessments. Additional questionnaires will assess mood, everyday life cognition, function and quality. This will be followed by a 6 week training period with 3 training sessions a week. The effect of the cognitive and physical training will be measured in a post-training evaluation session. Six months after completion of the training, the study will evaluate cognitive and physical abilities of participants to study long-term effects of the respective training program.  WHERE: Both the evaluation and the training sessions will be conducted on the premises of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudoise (Pavillon 4, Avenue de Beaumont, 1005 Lausanne, Switzerland)

Analysis of Dermal Fibroblasts and Immune Cells During Systemic Sclerosis The pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is still poorly understood and there are no effective treatments for this disease. SSc is a heterogeneous disease with varying severity. The heterogeneity of fibroblast profiles, observed in other fibrosing pathologies, has never been thoroughly explored in the skin of SSc patients. The immune system, and in particular B lymphocytes, plays a central role in the pathophysiology of SSc. The interactions between B lymphocytes and the cells responsible for excess collagen production, i.e. fibroblasts, are not fully elucidated The main objective is to analyze the heterogeneity of fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells as well as their molecular signature in the skin of patients with SSc
Prevention of Heart Failure in Type 2 Diabetes by Exercise Intervention Global longitudinal strain emerged as an important predictive marker that could be assessed during echocardiography. It enabled the detection of subclinical myocardial systolic dysfunction, without observable reductions in cardiac output or left ventricular ejection fraction, often years before diabetes induced heart failure. In asymptomatic T2D patients with no history of cardiovascular disease, an impaired global longitudinal strain is a predictor of future adverse left ventricular remodeling and adverse cardiovascular events. Exercise training is a promising intervention to interfere in the diabetes induced heart failure pathophysiology. However, the impact of different exercise modalities (e.g. intensity and volume) on the global longitudinal strain in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is unknown.
Neuromodulation of Lidocaine and Capsaicin Cream Effects on Pain Experience The aim of this study is to use a brain stimulation tool called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the analgesic (reducing sensitivity to pain) effects of lidocaine cream and the hyperalgesic (increasing sensitivity to pain) effects of capsaicin cream using a neutral cream as a control. tDCS stimulation has been shown to temporarily influence the way the stimulated part of the brain functions. With this method, the involvement of specific parts of the brain can be investigated in the working of the brain as a whole.
Effects of Smoking on Opioid Receptor Binding: A PET Study Background:  * Tobacco smoking is one of the most preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, but the addictive property of nicotine is such that fewer than 10 percent of people who attempt to quit smoking remain tobacco-free after 1 year. Researchers are studying the addictive properties of nicotine in an attempt to develop more successful medication therapies for smoking cessation. * Nicotine acts on chemical receptors in the brain, including opioid receptors that affect the perception of pain. Repeated nicotine administration can cause adaptations in the brain s opioid receptors, which heightens the addictive properties of nicotine and increases the likelihood and severity of withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation. Researchers are interested in using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain chemical responses to nicotine in current smokers and nonsmokers.  Objectives:  * To study brain chemical activity related to cigarette smoking and nicotine administration. * To compare the brain chemical activity of current daily smokers with that of nonsmokers.  Eligibility:  - Individuals 21 to 50 years of age who are either current smokers (10 to 25 cigarettes daily for at least 2 years) or have had some exposure to tobacco but have never smoked regularly (may have had a maximum of 20 cigarettes in their lifetime and none in past year).  Design:  * Eligible participants will undergo initial medical and psychological screening and neuropsychological testing before beginning the main phase of the study. Participants will be required to abstain from alcohol and drugs (except caffeine, nicotine, and prescription drugs) for 24 hours before each session, and smokers will refrain from smoking after midnight on the night before each session. * Session 1: Participants will answer questions about nicotine craving and withdrawal symptoms, followed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to provide baseline information about brain activity. * Session 2 and 3: Participants will answer questions about nicotine craving and withdrawal symptoms, and then will smoke one cigarette (either active nicotine or placebo). Researchers will document participants consumption of the cigarette. After the cigarette is smoked, participants will have a PET scan. Blood samples will be drawn during the PET session.
Predictive Factors of PTSD in Adults Admitted to an Emergency Service After trauma or stress factor like death exposition, serious injuries or sexual violence, some patients may develop stress reaction characterized by the presence of various symptoms among different categories (reviviscence, negative humor, dissociates symptoms, occasion, hypervigilance). In the month following trauma, the investigators speak of acute stress reaction (ASR) when symptoms are present during at least three days. If symptoms are present one month after trauma, then it is a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Among patients visiting emergency after latest trauma, quite a few is in acute stress reaction. However, this reaction is often incorrectly identified by healthcare team, due to lack of oriented medical examination, patients visiting about other complaints (pain, insomnia) and not expressing clearly the trauma context. Yet, it is know that acute stress reaction occurrence and existence of dissociate symptoms after trauma confrontation is considerably predictive of the eventual post-traumatic stress disorder occurrence.  The identification of risk population of post-traumatic stress disorder is not the subject of any particular structured procedure in emergency services while early care of these patients may allow limiting post-traumatic stress disorder occurrence and associate consequences. Previous works on the subject having exclusively targeted some trauma subgroups or some predictive factors subtypes, investigators propose here biopsychosocial global approach that can weight the impact of each parameters.  In this study, investigators aim at determining predictive biopsychosocial factors of the post-traumatic stress disorder occurrence at 3 months in patients visiting emergency after latest trauma (less than one month old) and identified as "high-risk" to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (moderate or high).
Zenith® Spiral-Z® AAA Iliac Leg Graft Post-market Registry The purpose of this registry is to obtain case reports of physician experience with the Spiral-Z® graft under routine clinical care.
IPI Biochemotherapy for Chemonaive Patients With Metastatic Melanoma The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the drug Yervoy (ipilimumab) that can be given with the drugs Temodar (temozolomide), Intron-A (interferon alfa-2b), Proleukin (aldesleukin, IL-2), and Platinol (cisplatin) to patients with metastatic melanoma. The safety of this combination will also be studied in Phase I. The goal of Phase II is to learn if this combination can help to control metastatic melanoma. Note: The study was closed following Phase I enrollment.  Ipilimumab, interferon alfa-2b, and aldesleukin are designed to block the activity of cells that decrease the immune system's ability to fight cancer.  Temozolomide is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of cells). This may stop the cancer cells from dividing into new cells.  Cisplatin is designed to poison the cancer cells, which may cause them to die.

Artificial Intelligence to Search for Abnormalities in Ambulatory Cancer Patients During treatment, cancer patients may experience side effects related to their disease but also to the different treatments they receive.  Currently, adverse effects and toxicities are well codified in the oncology community, notably via the NCI CTCAE criteria.  Unlike objective data such as a blood sample or a CTscan, a major bias in patient assessment is the subjective assessment of the physician or its team at a given time, which may not reflect the overall situation (for better or worse). Several studies had already highlighted the discrepancies between medical and patient data collection.  Self-assessment of symptoms is one way to overcome this bias. Moreover, there are now a large number of solutions that allow to perform these self-assessments at home.  Thanks to these tools, there are now two situations, the scheduled evaluation (before a chemotherapy treatment, or after a surgical procedure for instance) and the unscheduled situations, where it is the patient himself who can trigger an evaluation form.  These new evaluation methods also allow to take a quality of life approach. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is now a valid evidence-based assay to detect patient's symptoms and therefore provide helpful clinical information to healthcare providers.  The goal of this study is to go one step further than the previous PROs studies and evaluate the ability to train a machine learning algorithm to detect at-risk situations and lay the foundation for a viable solution for future prospective and randomized trials.

Thoracic Ultrasonography for Pulmonary Edema in Patients With Pre-Eclampsia This project will study the use of ultrasound of the chest for the detection of fluid in the lungs in patients with pre-eclampsia vs pregnant patients without pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a syndrome usually diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy in which patients develop elevated blood pressure and may develop protein in their urine, neurologic abnormalities, fluid in the lungs, and abnormal blood tests associated with the liver and kidney. Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) in pre-eclampsia can lead to patient discomfort and significant morbidity and mortality. It can be detected using chest x-ray, although this type of imaging offers significant disadvantages, including radiation, which is of particular concern in pregnant patients. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that chest x-ray is not very accurate in the detection of fluid in the lungs. Multiple previous studies have demonstrated the utility of chest ultrasonography in detecting fluid in the chest, although the vast majority of these studies involved patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Our goal is to evaluate bedside ultrasound of the chest in patients with pre-eclampsia in comparison to normal pregnant patients to determine whether these patients have abnormal fluid in the chest.  The investigators will divide our patients into two groups. In the study group, the investigators will include patients with pre-eclampsia with or without shortness of breath, and in the control group, the investigators will include pregnant patients without pre-eclampsia. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients enrolled in the study. These patients will then undergo an ultrasound of the chest, performed by a member of the Emergency Medicine Ultrasound Division. The images will be transmitted wirelessly from the ultrasound machine to a secure web based cloud (Q-path) and will be subsequently reviewed by expert reviewers.

Impact on the OLAF Intervention to Prevent Post Traumatic Disorders During the Confinement. The investigators thought that the confinement measure took in France could induce an increase in the post traumatic syndrome in the relative of patient hospitalized in ICU during this period indeed the restricted visit and the limited interaction with ICU team are documented risk factors for PTSD in this population. The investigators designed an intervention in order to prevent the effect of the confinement measures on PTSD in relatives named OLAF. In this research the investigators aimed to study the impact on this intervention on PTSD.
Low Dialysate Temperature During SLED Objectives: This study is evaluating the hemodynamic effects of lowering the dialysate temperature in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients submitted to sustained low efficiency dialysis (SLED) in a single large center.  Methods: Participants will be randomly assigned to two treatment groups. One group will be started treatment with low temperature (set point 5 on the machine which is around 35°C) for one treatment and then alternate between high and low temperatures for a maximum of 8 treatments. The other group will be started with high temperature (set point 9 on the machine which is around 37°C) for the first treatment then alternate between high and low temperatures for a maximum of 8 treatments. Each participants will need at least two treatments, one with each temperature to be included in the analysis. The investigators will be looking for the number of events during a SLED treatment. Events will be defined as drop in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg or drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥10 mmHg, requirement of resuscitation with IVF after initiation of SLED, initiation or increase requirement of vasoactive drugs.
Evaluation of Ubiquinol on Mitochondrial Oxidative Capacity in Statin Patients Using 31PMRS It is our primary hypothesis that statin drugs impair skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and that ubiquinol (the reduced active form of CoQ10) supplementation will block impairment of PCr recovery kinetics in patients using statins. The investigators propose a pilot study to extend our research to examine PCr recovery kinetics in 20 statin users randomized in a parallel arm study to either ubiquinol or placebo over 4 weeks.
nCLE For Diagnosis Of Peripheral Lung Nodules By Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) employs a small fiber which can be passed through a biopsy needle to enable real time microscopic imaging of cells. With resolution of 3.5 microns it is possible to identify key features consistent with malignancy and pulmonary fibrosis. (Wijmans, et al., 2019). The effectiveness of nCLE with intravenous fluorescein has been demonstrated in central lung cancers using esophageal ultrasound guided needle placement (Wijmans, et al., 2019). In this study, the proposed nCLE lung cancer criteria had high accuracy for lung cancer detection and were consistently recognized by multiple raters. Probe based confocal microscopy (pCLE) has also been used in conjunction with a radial probe EBUS in evaluating solitary pulmonary nodules with a diagnostic accuracy of 79.2%. (Hassan, et al., 2017) Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) has not previously been used in conjunction with robotic navigational bronchoscopy.

Feasibility and Effect of a Strategy-Based Cognitive Intervention for Parkinson Disease Parkinson disease (PD) affects over 1 million Americans and causes considerable personal and socioeconomic costs (\>$34 billion/year in the US) that are expected to rise as the population ages. Cognitive impairment produces disability and reduced quality of life among non-demented people with PD. Surgical and pharmacologic treatments for PD do not prevent or treat cognitive impairment and may even exacerbate the problem. As such, cognitive rehabilitation treatments that mitigate its negative functional consequences are a top research priority.  Unfortunately, existing cognitive rehabilitative programs for PD, which focus on restoring deficient cognitive processes through process training (repetitive practice of tasks that challenge specific cognitive processes), have had limited effect on daily function. To overcome this limitation, the investigators take a strategy training approach. Trained occupational therapists teach people targeted strategies to use in everyday life to circumvent cognitive deficits and accomplish meaningful daily activities. Contemporary cognitive rehabilitation evidence supports this approach for people with chronic neurocognitive dysfunction from stroke and brain injury; however, it has not been studied in PD. By teaching strategies for everyday cognition and using training techniques to support transfer of learning beyond the training context, the investigators hypothesize that our strategy training interventions will produce better functional outcomes for people with PD compared to process training.  The investigators developed MultiContext for PD (MC4PD) to enable people with PD to apply strategies in their everyday lives to cope with cognitive decline and improve or maintain daily function. MC4PD is an individualized, community-based intervention that focuses on the attainment of personally meaningful functional goals using training techniques known to enhance strategy learning and transfer. In an iterative case series, the investigators fine-tuned the treatment protocol, established good participant acceptance and engagement, and provided preliminary data on its benefits for daily cognitive function. The next step is to confirm MC4PD's feasibility in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In this project, the investigators will assess feasibility and treatment fidelity and generate data in preparation for a definitive RCT by conducting a single-blind pilot RCT comparing MC4PD to a standard-of-care treatment (Control). Individuals with PD will complete pre-treatment testing, randomization to treatment group, 10 treatment sessions, and immediate and 3 months post-treatment testing.
The Real-World Endeavor Resolute Versus XIENCE V Drug-Eluting Stent Study in Twente The TWENTE Study is a single center prospective single-blinded randomized study.

The general practitioner of the patient will be requested not to disclose this information to the patient. Analysts who perform the data analyses will be blinded to the type DES used as well.
Supporting Habit Formation to Attenuate Prefrailty in Elders: Pilot Study The Supporting Habit Formation to Attenuate Prefrailty in Elders (SHAPE) Pilot Study is a randomized control study. The main objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using Habit Formation (HF) treatment to increase Physical Activity (PA) (reduction in daily in hours of sedentary time), and dietary among prefrail African Americans. We hypothesize: (1)The SHAPE study will demonstrate good feasibility with a high recruitment rate and successful administration all of the measures among the target population; (2) Treatment group participants will demonstrate greater increases in primary outcomes (physical activity level and dietary quality) and secondary outcomes (quality of life, depressive symptoms, prefrailty reduction, lower extremity strength and balance, physical activity level, waist circumference, and weight at intervention completion.
Acceptability and Safety of 3D Printed Wrist-based Splints Non-invasiveness, avoidance of complications and comfort are important issues in the clinical management of conservatively treated distal radius and scaphoid fractures. To date, applying a plaster cast for approximately 6 weeks of immobilization is the gold standard. However, new 3D-technologies such as the design of Patient Specific Anatomical Braces (PSAB) will lead to a new paradigm of treatment. Swibrace has developed such anatomical, light, elegant and yet resistant braces. First, the fractured limb is scanned, the data then sent to a specifically designed software, printed in a 3D-printer and finally sent to the hospital for the patient's fitting. As these PSAB have not yet been tested on patients, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patient satisfaction with a 3D-printed PSAB differs from the one of traditionally treated patients in a plaster cast.  (A pre-clinical study will be conducted with 10 healthy volunteers testing the 3D splint for 72h. Only if splint satisfaction will be ≥ 70% as measured by the self-designed "Adult Rated Splint Evaluation Questionnaire" (ARSEQ), the 3D splint will be tested in patients. Otherwise, adjustments to the splint will be made based on the healthy volunteers' feedback prior to its testing in patients.)
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Among ICU Survivors Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition characterized by reflux of stomach contents causing troublesome symptoms and complications. Typical symptoms include heart burn (a retrosternal burning sensation), regurgitation (perception of flow of refluxed stomach content into the mouth or hypopharynx) and chest pain. As per recently published global guidelines (2017) by World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO), the presence of heartburn and/or regurgitation symptoms 2 or more times a week is suggestive of GERD. Global burden of GERD in general population is approximately 1.03 billion, the prevalence of GERD varies geographically, with the highest prevalence of 19.55% in North America while in Asia, the estimated rate is 12.92%. However the data regarding the prevalence of GERD in intensive care unit (ICU) population is not yet established; which is expected higher after recovery from their current acute illness. In a healthy individual, several factors contribute to the prevention of reflux and to minimizing esophageal acid exposure: lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, the diaphragmatic crura, gravity, esophageal peristalsis, salivary bicarbonate and the integrity of esophageal epithelium. But in critically ill these factors are compromised leading to high incidence of GERD. Interventions commonly used in managing critically ill patients such as sedation, presence of an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation, enteral tube feedings, positioning, and medications, along with specific patient characteristics and comorbid conditions contribute to an increased risk for GERD in this population. GERD results in various symptoms which has impact on quality of life. Various reliable and validated generic and disease specific instruments are available to measure symptom severity of the disease. In the present study, among GERD patients, commonly and freely available GERD-Health-related quality of life (GERD-HRQL) score will be used which is a disease-specific instrument. This observational study will screen and enroll adult patients who survived at the time of ICU discharge.
Effects of Thoracic Screw Manipulation in Patients With Cervical Radiculopathy Cervical radiculopathy is a pain and/or sensorimotor deficit syndrome that is defined as being caused by compression of a cervical nerve root. The compression can occur as a result of disc herniation, Spondylosis, instability, trauma, or rarely, tumors.  Thoracic spine manipulation (TSM) is defined as a high-velocity/low amplitude movement or "thrust" directed at any segment of the thoracic spine. Recent research has shown that Thoracic Joint Manipulation directed to the thoracic spine provides a therapeutic benefit to patients with neck pain and has been suggested as an appropriate strategy to minimize the risks associated with manipulation of the cervical spine

Genetic and Epigenetic Risk of T2D in the UAE T2D is a global public health crisis and a threat to socioeconomic development of all nations, particularly in developing countries. Countries in the Gulf region, including the UAE, have some of the highest rates of T2D worldwide. The epidemic in the region has grown in parallel with the worldwide rise in obesity, which is fuelled by rapid urbanization, nutrition transition, and increasing sedentary lifestyles. Whether these unfavourable changes in environmental risk factors can explain the increased risk of T2D in the region, or whether the populations in the Gulf region are more genetically susceptible to disease is yet to be investigated.  In this study, for the first time, the contribution of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors towards the increased risk of T2D amongst the population of the UAE will be investigated. This will be through, firstly, identifying environmental risk factors with higher prevalence rates, and bigger effect sizes on T2D in the UAE in comparison to Europe. Secondly, identifying genetic variants known to predict T2D in Europeans/other populations, but with stronger association with T2D in Emiratis. Thirdly, identifying novel genetic variants that are perhaps rare in Europeans/other populations, but confer increased risk for T2D in the UAE. Lastly, candidate genes underlying T2D pathogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms will be identified in Emiratis and Europeans. The end result is to identify the underlying candidate markers and mechanisms involved in T2D pathogenesis, which can better explain differences in magnitude of risk across populations.

Carboplatin and Paclitaxel With or Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with bevacizumab is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.
Efficiency of Lina LibrataTM System Menometrorrhagia is the first cause of consultation in gynecology. Etiology of menometrorrhagia is varied, but in majority of cases no underlying pathology is found, they are said functional idiopathic menometrorrhagia .  In case of failure of medical treatment, for women who do not wish to preserve reproduction possibilities, a surgical treatment by endometrectomy (destruction of the uterine endometrial epithelial) can be proposed. Currently, a new system, Lina LibrataTM is available on the market. This system allows destructing endometrial membrane with a balloon which offer several advantages compared to present used system. Specially, it does not require dilatation of uterus's cervix and it reduces the pain. The investigator make hypothesis that the use of the system Lina LibrataTM does not cause pain and can be thus used under local anesthetic in ambulatory surgery. With the aim of developing ambulatory care, the main objective of this prospective monocentric study is to estimate the efficiency of Lina LibrataTM system in the treatment of functional idiopathic menometrorrhagia. Secondary objectives are to estimate the pain during the procedure, the rate of per and post-complications and quality of life.
Large Sample PD Patients and Healthy Controls Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has frequently been used to investigate local spontaneous brain activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) in a whole-brain, voxel-wise manner. To quantitatively integrate these studies, we conducted a coordinate-based meta-analysis on 15 studies that used amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and 11 studies that used regional homogeneity (ReHo). All these ALFF and ReHo studies have compared PD patients with healthy controls. We also performed a validation RS-fMRI study of ALFF and ReHo in a frequency-dependent manner for a novel dataset consisting of PD and healthy controls.
Affective Attentional Bias Training In Depression Biased attention toward negatively valenced information has been considered as a mechanism for risk and relapse in depression. Those with depression tend to focus their visual attention first, more frequently, and for longer periods of time, if it connotes negative (particularly sad) mood. To this end, investigators have recently discovered that this bias might be modifiable. However, the existing literature is mixed with regard to effectiveness. The investigators propose in this study a novel approach to modifying attention bias in depression by using real time feedback with eye tracking technology. The investigators will examine if, compared to a sham condition, rewarding attention toward positive stimuli results in improved mood and reductions in attention bias. Following three sessions of either sham training or active attentional bias training, the investigators hypothesize that participants in the active training condition will experience a) reductions in negative attentional bias, and b) to an improved mood state and increased quality of life, compared to those in the sham training condition.
Exercise-induced Changes in Exosomes The proposed study aims to shed light on the function/importance/relevance of exercise-induced changes in exosomes to connective tissues. Exosomes are known to increase robustly in response to exercise. We have previously shown that serum isolated from subjects after they lift heavy weights increases human engineered ligament collagen content and mechanics more than serum from before they lift weight. Further, we showed that exercise-induced changes in hormones could not explain the change in ligament structure or function. These data indicate that there is a significant gap in our understanding of muscle-connective tissue crosstalk. To address this gap, the current proposal seeks to: i) isolate and sequence exosomal RNA (long non-coding, miR, and mRNA) and ii) determine whether exosomes isolated from serum after exercise increase engineered ligament mechanics and collagen content.
Multi Center Prospective Registry of Infliximab Use for Childhood Uveitis The primary objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of infliximab for the treatment of persistent uveitis in children.

Prevention and Management of Intravesical BCG-related Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Common local side effects are generally seen during induction and during the first 6 months of BCG maintenance. BCG-related cystitis is frequent and unavoidable. Furthermore, repeated BCG instillation increases the incidence and severity of irritative bladder symptoms. Several methods attempted to reduce the intensity and frequency of BCG- related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as, administration of anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid or oral antibiotic ofloxacin or by reducing the BCG dose, but without any encouraging results. Local side effects requiring cessation of treatment are seen more frequently in the first year of therapy, preventing patients from receiving their BCG maintenance regimen.  Pentosan Polysulphate (PPS), is an oral medication with unique analgesic properties used to relieve bladder pain and discomfort related to other conditions, has been investigated in a small study with encouraging result in this patient population. This suggest that PPS is well tolerated and effective at decreasing BCG-related LUTS.  The purpose of this study is first to investigate the efficacy of co-administration of Pentosan Polysulphate to prevent these adverse events and the impact of this intervention on quality of life. The second goal is to determine which patients are more vulnerable to develop BCG- related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), based on clinical assessment, demographics data, voiding parameters, and urinary inflammatory markers, and then to assess the effectiveness of BCG therapy following co-administration of ELMIRON.

For patients with incomplete clearance in the treated area at 8 weeks the treatment strategy for this area will be recorded but no further follow-up will take place. The effectiveness, tolerability, adherence, patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) associated with Picato® treatment will be evaluated.
Cyclophosphamide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone together with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.  PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone together with bortezomib to see how well it works in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

All participants will complete questionnaires before and immediately following the programs and another one 3 months later. Immediately following the program some of the Project ÒRÉ groups will also participate in a focus group to provide feedback about the program.
A Randomized Study to Compare the Safety and Immunogenicity of Fluviral® Made With New Versus Aged Bulk Vaccination is currently the most effective means of controlling influenza and preventing its complications and mortality in persons at risk.  Once a year, a meeting of World Health Organization (WHO) experts takes place, leading to a recommendation on the influenza A and B strains that should be used for the production of vaccine for the coming influenza season. For the strains which do not change from the previous year, the vaccine can be formulated from the old mono bulk from the previous year.  Bulks as old as 12 months may be blended to make trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) under the current Canadian and US licenses. This study is conducted to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Fluviral vaccines made with the aged bulk material compared with the new bulk material. This protocol posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sept 2007.
Intervention Program for Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a syndrome defined as a cognitive decline that is more severe than can be explained by an individual's age and education. One study in the United States found that MCI caregivers have experienced distress in association with caregiver burden. The prevalence of MCI for people age 65 and older ranges from 3% to 19%. Understanding the process of family caregiving provides a knowledge base for the health professionals when developing effective interventions. However, little is known about the phenomenon of family caregiving to patients with MCI in Taiwan.  Therefore, the purpose of the proposed study is to develop a theoretical model and a model-based intervention program for family caregivers of patients with MCI in Taiwan, and pilot test it in a clinical trial.

Efficacy of Chemopreventive Agents on Disease-free and Overall Survival in Patients With Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma: The CAOS Study The evidence on the value of aspirin, statins, metformin, beta-blocking ACE inhibitors agents as chemopreventive agents in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is limited.  The aim of this study is to assess whether regular use of aspirin, statins, metformin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blocking agents use, before diagnosis, after surgery and in neo-adjuvant treatment setting, can increase rate of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in participants with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The secondary aim is to evaluate if there is any difference in terms of "chemoprevention" between aspirin, statins, metformin and beta-blocking as chemopreventive agents, and if their prolonged daily use can positively influence the chemopreventive action.  400 patients with the following inclusion criteria will be enrolled in 3 years:  1. cytological or histological diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in any portion of the gland, with or without metastases in other sites 2. patient age between 18 and 90 years 3. any medicine or drug in the daily patient therapy 4. Patients undergone to primary chemoradiotherapy or surgical resection, followed by adjuvant therapy or preceded by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, are included in the study Anamnestic, clinical and pathological data, included data on the aspirin, statins, metformin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blocking agents assumption will be collected during the first visit with the surgeon. A database managed by a dedicated data manager will be created to collect and analyse data.  Patients will be followed for at least 24 months The study will last overall 5 years.

Effect of Food Composition on Postprandial Insulin Secretion in Neonatal Diabetes Neonatal diabetes is diagnosed before 6 months of age and causes high blood glucose levels due to the pancreas not secreting insulin. Neonatal diabetes can be caused by a change in a DNA region called the KCNJ11 gene. KCNJ11 encodes a channel in the pancreas that acts as a switch to turn 'on' and 'off' insulin secretion. A change in KCNJ11 results in a faulty channel, which keeps insulin secretion 'switched off'. The diabetes can be treated with tablets called sulphonylureas that switch the pancreatic channel 'on', allowing it to secrete insulin in response to gut hormones called incretins. Previous research has shown that patients who switch from insulin to sulphonylureas have better blood glucose control, including fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia (glucose dropping too low), and also avoid the need for injections. It is thought that serious side effects from sulphonylureas are uncommon in KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes. Some patients report low glucose after meals and we think this may be because they make too much insulin if they eat a meal with protein but low amounts of carbohydrate. The investigators will test this by giving study participants different meals and measuring the amount of insulin, glucose and incretin hormone in the blood afterwards.
Assessment of Fatty Acids in Infants' Blood Cells When Consuming Infant Formula Containing Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids To compare amounts of DHA, ARA, and other fatty acids in the blood cells of infants consuming infant formulas containing differing levels of fatty acids
Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Postoperative Delirium After Awake Craniotomies Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication, and the incidence of POD ranges from 10% to 60%. Previous studies suggested that frontal approach and tumor located at the temporal lobe were independent risk factors for POD after supratentorial tumor resections. Therefore, patients undergoing awake craniotomies are high-risk populations for POD. A lot of trials show that dexmedetomidine might help to reduce the incidence of delirium in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. However, the impact of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on POD for patients undergoing awake craniotomies remains unclear.

Feasibility of Egg-Based Diet Interventions and Assessing Perinatal Mental Health The goals of this study are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a dietary intervention to increase choline intake through whole foods (eggs) in pregnant and lactating women for mental health benefits. We will achieve these goals through the following specific aims:  1. To determine the effects of including eggs as a source of choline in the diets of pregnant and lactating women on biomarkers, we will measure concentrations of choline and choline metabolites in maternal serum and breastmilk at 24-26 weeks gestation and 4-6 weeks postpartum. 2. To evaluate adherence to a food-based dietary choline intervention in pregnant and lactating women, we will track intake via daily photo and written food logs. 3. To assess the feasibility of collecting repeated measures of dietary intake and maternal depression, anxiety, and stress in the perinatal period, we will track completion rates for project surveys.  The data from this study will inform the design and sample size calculations for a longitudinal cohort study that will assess neurological outcomes for both mother and child and follow the offspring over time to reassess mental health and cognitive development in preschool-aged children.  Choline is an underconsumed nutrient of concern for public health, specifically during pregnancy and lactation. There is limited data on biomarker or health outcomes related to perinatal choline intake. Determining relationships between perinatal choline intake and maternal mental health has the potential to impact public health by ultimately informing development of nutrition education materials in the clinical setting focused on encouraging maternal perinatal choline intake through whole foods such as eggs.

Brain Fitness APP for Aging With a Healthy Brain Memory and cognitive declines are associated with normal brain aging but are also precursors to dementia, in particular the so called the pandemic of the century, Alzheimer's disease. While currently there is no cure or "vaccine" against dementia, there are hopes to delay the onset of the disease by living a brain-healthy life style. The proposed research offers a novel approach to prevent dementia and age-related cognitive disorders.  It is proposed to create a brain fitness APP for the aging population. The proposed APP is based on the premise of brain plasticity, and targets the brain functions that are declining with normal aging and dementia.  The proposed APP will be tested on a large population with statistical rigor (60 healthy individuals of age 65+ years and up to 30 individuals with cognitive impairment); the participants will be divided into an intervention group and a control group. We will analyze the logged performance of the participants, and assess their cognitive state with an independent test compared to a matched control group before and after the trial.  It is anticipated that the frequent use of the proposed APP will help to maintain a healthy brain as well as detecting the onset of a cognitive decline in aging population. In addition, its frequent use will slow and even reverse the progression of the cognition decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The APP will have many different levels of difficulty so that it can be applied to a wide age range and conditions.

Memory and Attention Adaptation Training-Geriatrics (MAAT-G) Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) affects up to 75% of patients receiving chemotherapy and older adults are at greater risk of developing CRCD, which can negatively affect their functional independence and quality of life. Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a promising treatment for CRCD that improves perceived cognition in younger cancer survivors, but needs to be adapted for older adults to address their unique needs. The proposed study will adapt MAAT for older adults using feedback from key stakeholders (older adults with cancer and their caregivers), and test usability of the intervention.

Interscalene Block Versus Combined Infraclavicular-Anterior Suprascapular Blocks for Shoulder Surgery Postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery remains a challenge in patients with preexisting pulmonary pathology, as interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB), the standard nerve block for shoulder surgery, carries a prohibitive risk of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis (HDP). Although several diaphragm-sparing nerve blocks have been proposed, none seems to offer equivalent analgesia to ISB while avoiding HDP altogether. For instance, even costoclavicular blocks, which initially fulfilled both requirements, were subsequently found to result in a non-negligible 5%-incidence of HDP.  In this randomized trial, the authors set out to compare ISB and combined infraclavicular block-anterior suprascapular nerve blocks (ICB-ASSNB) for patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery. The authors hypothesized that ICB-ASSNB would provide equivalent postoperative analgesia to ISB 30 minutes after shoulder surgery and therefore designed the current study as an equivalence trial.
Comparison of Buteyko Technique and Pursed Lip Breathing in Asthma The objective of the study was to compare the effects of Buteyko breathing technique and pursed lip breathing technique in the management of asthma. A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 asthmatic patients randomly allocated to Buteyko technique group and pursed lip breathing group.

Core Stability, Trunk Position Sense, Balance and Functional Mobility in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis The aim of this study is to compare balance, functional mobility, core stability and trunk position sense in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) and healthy controls and investigate the relationship between core stability and trunk position sense with balance and functional mobility in PwMS.  Balance and mobility disorders are seen in various degrees in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). Balance and mobility impairments are observed in the beginning with the early period and are one of the most common causes of disability in PwMS.  Coordination between the peripheral sensory system, the central sensory-motor system and the musculoskeletal system which generates motor responses is required to provide balance. If one or more of these systems do not function properly, this results in deficiency in trunk stability and also causes balance and mobility disorders.  It has been shown that balance and mobility disorders are mostly associated with loss of strength, spasticity, coordination disorders and sensory loss. Especially, it is known that strength of core are related to balance and mobility. Although core muscle strength is a significant element of trunk stability, position sense is also responsible for trunk stability. When literature is examined, there is no study which examines the relationship between balance and mobility with core muscles' strength and trunk position sense in PwMS. For all these reasons, we think that balance and functional mobility may be related to core stability and trunk position sense in PwMS
The Impact of a Parenting Intervention on Latino Youth Health Behaviors The purpose of this study is to test if a parenting program can be used to prevent substance use among Latino youth and at the same time promote healthy eating. Pairs of 7th grade students and one of their parents will be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to three groups: an existing parenting intervention focusing on substance use prevention (FPNG), the enhanced parenting intervention that also has nutrition content (FPNG+), and a comparison program focused on academic success. Only parents will attend intervention sessions. Data will be collected from the parent and their 7th grade student to see how these programs impacted substance use, nutrition, and parenting. The investigators hypothesize that families receiving the FPNG+ will have improved nutrition habits than the other conditions. Students in both FPNG and FPNG+ will have lower substance use rates as compared to the academic success program. In addition, the effects of parenting strategies and sociocultural factors on the FPNG and FPNG+ results will be studied.

The Clinical Markers for PARP Inhibitors-related Efficacy in Ovarian Cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. PARP inhibitors(PARPi) are an important progress in EOC treatment. The available evidence suggests that BRCAmt or HRD-positive is an effective biological marker for PARPi. However, in our previous clinical observation, it was found that the tumor burden may be the potential clinical markers PARPi. We intend to develop a real-world study to confirm the potential clinical markers and explore new clinical markers for PARPi.

Thiamine and Acute Decompensated Heart Failure: Pilot Study Heart failure remains an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States even in the face of recent advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. There is an urgent need to reevaluate the treatment of heart failure. Shifting substrate utilization used in energy metabolism from fatty acids to glucose is beneficial to the heart presumably by increasing the efficiency of ATP production. Several new drugs for the treatment of cardiac ischemia work by this mechanism. There is increasing evidence that patients with heart failure may also benefit by the same type of intervention. Patients with heart failure are known to have low serum thiamine levels because of poor dietary intake and increased urinary excretion. Inadequate thiamine will deleteriously shift substrate utilization from glucose to fatty acids.  We hypothesize that thiamine supplementation will be beneficial for patients with heart failure by increasing glucose and decreasing fatty acid utilization. This will be initially tested in a pilot double-blinded placebo controlled study of thiamine supplementation in diabetic and non-diabetic patients presenting to the emergency department with acute decompensated heart failure.
Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter, Carotid Duplex and Transcranial Duplex as a Prognostic Factor Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) had been proved to be associated with increased intracranial pressure and can be used as one of the prognostic factors in cardiac arrest patients. It is simple, quick and can be measured repeatedly. Carotid duplex and transcranial duplex(TCD) provide rapid, noninvasive, real-time measures of cerebrovascular function. It can be used to assess the vascular territory by measuring blood flow, and to evaluate factors include brain perfusion, plaque morphology, and patency of intracranial collaterals. Hence, it could act as a crucial role in neuroprognosis in post-arrest patients. In this study, the investigator aimed to analyze the ONSD diameters, ONSD/external transverse diameter (ETD) ratio, carotid duplex and transcaranial duplex parameters in different stages of post-cardiac arrest care, demographic characteristics and resuscitation information with the neurological outcome of post-cardiac arrest patients. The ONSD diameter, and ONSD/ETD ratio were compared with age-, and sex-matched normal volunteers.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Mode Impact on Clinical Blood Arterial Pressure Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Two positive airway pressure (PAP) modalities can be used: Fixed pressure, in which the effective pressure is set and kept constant all night, and auto CPAP devices where the positive pressure changes during the night depend on patient's requirements.  Hypothesis: Pressure variations associated with autoCPAP functioning can lead to sleep fragmentation and alterations in sleep structure. This can limit blood pressure dipping during sleep and then impact clinical blood pressure reduction.  Main objective: To compare in a randomized controlled trial 4 months clinical blood pressure (BP) evolution depending on CPAP mode: fixed pressure versus autoCPAP. Secondary outcomes: Evolution of arterial stiffness, biological parameters, quality of life and symptoms.  Methods: Patients will be randomised depending on CPAP mode. Baseline and 4 months evaluation will include: 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, clinical BP measurements and carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Patients will also complete quality of life and symptoms questionnaires.  2 interim analysis will be carried out when 150 and 220 patients respectively will have completed the study. The Peto's method will be used to correct the p-values.
Retrospective Evaluation of Liposarcoma Retrospective Evaluation of Survival after Liposarcoma
The Evaluation of a CONSORT Based Online Writing Tool Introduction: Inadequate reporting is a frequent cause of waste of research. For example, essential information for evaluating the risk of bias such as the method of randomization is lacking in 75% of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and over 30% of reports do not provide sufficient details to allow replication of the treatment evaluated in the trial in clinical practice. To overcome this issue, the CONSORT statement, an evidence-based, minimum set of recommendations for reporting RCTs was developed in 1996. These guidelines have since been updated in 2001 and more recently in 2010. In addition, extensions to the main CONSORT statement have been developed to give additional guidance for RCTs with specific designs (eg cluster), data (eg harm), and interventions (eg nonpharmacologic treatments). Many journals endorse the CONSORT statement. Some journals provide recommendations to authors to follow the CONSORT guidelines and some editors enforce the use of the CONSORT guidelines by requesting authors to submit a checklist in either the submission or acceptance stage. Nevertheless, inadequate reporting remains.  Our objective is to evaluate the impact of the CONSORT based online writing tool on the completeness of reporting.

Assessment of the Functional Outcome and Quality of Life in Sarcoma Patients Primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas are an exceptionally rare form of cancer, collectively accounting for only 1% of all malignancies diagnosed. Sarcomas often occur in the patients' extremities and treatment typically involves limb salvage surgery with bone and/or muscle resection. These surgeries often leave the patients with disfigurements, psychological trauma, and functional disabilities. Perhaps, the most difficult and life-altering decision that patients (and their parents) with primary bone sarcomas about the knee joint have to make, involves choosing the type of surgical procedure that will provide them with the outcome that meets their functional as well as aesthetic expectations.  In literature, the quality of life for patients with osteosarcoma around the knee joint after three different surgical procedures, that is, amputation, endoprosthetic reconstruction and rotationplasty was evaluated. There was found that patients treated with rotationplasty showed significantly higher functional scores compared to the two other groups of patients. Also, researchers investigated the long-term quality of life after bone sarcoma surgery around the knee joint and found that, despite the functional disability, survivors were busy with work, study, relationships, and sometimes they have founded a family.  Most published reports in the literature on assessment of gait in the lower-extremity sarcoma survivors were focused on bone sarcoma patients after wide resection and endoprosthetic reconstruction. To the knowledge of the investigator, there has been no published studies on gait analysis after resection of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the lower extremity. The rare and heterogeneous aspects of STS and the paucity of knowledge of movement strategies in these patients hinder the development of effective rehabilitation protocols for recovering movement after resection of STS in the lower limb.

Self-help for Treating Social Anxiety Disorder: An Evaluation of a Mindfulness and Acceptance-based Approach Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety disorder, affecting up to 10% of the population and causing significant distress. Fortunately, there are effective interventions including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). However, only about a third of people with SAD seek treatment. There are a number of barriers to seeking treatment, including cost, availability, and stigma. Self-help may be one way to reach people who may not otherwise present for treatment. Research on self-help books for SAD based on CBT has yielded promising results. However, no research to date has examined the efficacy of ACT-based self-help for SAD. The primary purpose of the present study is to evaluate The Mindfulness and Acceptance-based Workbook for Social Anxiety and Shyness (Fleming \& Kocovski, 2013), an ACT-based self-help book. Socially anxious participants will be randomly assigned to receive the workbook or be placed on a waitlist. It is hypothesized that workbook participants will report significantly reduced social anxiety at the end of eight weeks compared to waitlist participants. The secondary purpose is to evaluate how the treatment works. Increases in mindfulness and acceptance have been shown to lead to reduced social anxiety. These same variables will be examined in the present study. Finally, this research aims to examine variables that can predict who may do well in treatment. Given that two-thirds of people who meet criteria for this disorder will not seek traditional treatments, it is important to develop and evaluate alternative treatments, including those based on self-help.

Dance for the Improvement of Balance and Gait After Stroke Stroke can drastically impact the ability to walk and keep your balance. In addition people with chronic stroke feel social isolated, become less satisfied with their walking and lose confidence in their ability to move without falling.  Ned new treatments are needed for walking and balance. Dancing is a fun, social activity that has similar benefits to traditional exercise. Another benefit of dancing is the use of music, which improves mood, increases motivation and can even improve motor performance. Finally, moving in synchrony with other people during dancing can make people feel connected. We believe that dance classes can benefit people with stroke, but few studies have been done.  The objective of our project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether dance can improve balance and walking for people with chronic stroke. The investigators are also interested in whether dancing improves people's confidence in their ability to do activities without losing their balance (i.e. balance confidence), decreases their feelings of isolation and increases their quality of life.

The fellow-eye will receive topical prednisolone acetate 1% (tapering schedule of QID, TID, BID, QD over 30 days). The fellow-eye design in n=30 patients (60 eyes) allows for balance in patient baseline demographic and systemic characteristics.
Deficit Fields for Stroke Recovery This study investigates the potential of customized robotic and visual feedback interaction to improve recovery of movements in stroke survivors. While therapists widely recognize that customization is critical to recovery, little is understood about how take advantage of statistical analysis tools to aid in the process of designing individualized training. Our approach first creates a model of a person's own unique movement deficits, and then creates a practice environment to correct these problems. Experiments will determine how the deficit-field approach can improve (1) reaching accuracy, (2) range of motion, and (3) activities of daily living. The findings will not only shed light on how to improve therapy for stroke survivors, it will test hypotheses about fundamental processes of practice and learning. This study will help us move closer to our long-term goal of clinically effective treatments using interactive devices.
Comparison Between Endovascular and Bronchoscopic Tumor Marker Insertion for Real-time Stereotactic-guided Radiotherapy in Lung Cancer The role of radiotherapy is well established in the management of early stage lung cancer or as part of a multidisciplinary approach of locally advanced lung cancer (1).  Recent advances in Cyberknife© technology, which is a robotic system of stereotactic irradiation including localisation and real time lesion-tracking, has led to an increase in accuracy and potentially in efficiency of the irradiation of tumor field (2)(3). According to several studies, promising results in local control and survival rates have been achieved in patients suffering from primary lung cancer or peripheral lung metastasis treated with Cyberknife© (4)(5)(6)(7)(8).  Fiducial markers are implanted in or near a tumor in a configuration defining a COM (center of mass) guiding the Cyberknife for tumor localization.  Tumor movement is then synchronized to respiratory cycle motion during treatment which reduces toxicity of non target lung tissue irradiation. Change in marker positioning leads to COM alterations, thus limiting detection by the tracking system.  Percutaneous (9)(10)(11) (12), endovascular (12)(13) fiducial implantation or by means of bronchoscopic devices (14)(15)(16)(17)(18) are three techniques that have been validated in previous studies as feasible and safe procedures, providing accurate tracking.  Few studies are currently available in the litterature comparing these modalities (19)(20). The percutaneous implantation technique will not be considered for this study because this technique is associated with a high risk of pneumothorax (9).  Both the endobronchial and endovascular technique have been described in the literature with equivalent success rate (87-90%) in intention to treat (21)(22).  One of the endpoints of this study is to verify that these results are reproducible in our institution where both techniques are currently available and to investigate other secondary endpoints such as fiducial marker migration after placement, complications rates and procedure time.
Neurofilament Light Chains and Cognitive Impairment in Chronic Psychiatric Disease The validation of biomarkers allowing the discrimination of cognitive and behavioral disorders of psychiatric origin from those of neurodegenerative origin would facilitate diagnosis and improve patient management. Neurofilaments, which are markers of neuronal lysis, appear to be a promising biomarker. In a previous preliminary study, the investigators demonstrated significantly lower concentrations of neurofilaments in CSF of psychiatric patients compared to neurodegenerative diseases.  The main objective of this study is to validate the plasma assay of neurofilament light chain as a biomarker for the differential diagnosis of psychiatric or neurodegenerative cognitive impairment. Other biomarkers of interest (Tau, TDP-43, GFAP and UCH-L1) will also be analyzed.  A sub-part of this study will also focus on the retrospective analysis of the CSF/Plasma correlations of the different biomarkers mentioned above from tube bottom samples taken in routine care.
Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient-guided Versus Standard Beta-blocker Therapy in Primary Prevention of Variceal Bleeding Study hypothesis:  Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)-directed primary prophylaxis with nonselective beta-blocker therapy (NSBB) leads to a reduction in first variceal bleeding episodes and is cost-effective in the long term.  Study design:  A multi-center randomized controlled study comparing nonselective beta-blocker therapy guided by the hemodynamic response as determined by the difference in HVPG before and after starting oral NSBB therapy, to standard heart rate-guided NSBB therapy in patients with esophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis without a history of esophageal variceal hemorrhage.  Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:  First variceal bleeding episodes occurring within the first two years.  Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study:  * Mortality * Occurrence of other cirrhosis-related complications * Occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma * Costs of treatments * Adverse effects
Epidemiology and Cost of Falls in Veterans With a Spinal Cord Injury Brief Summary Detailed Description Background: A multitude of risk factors for falling has been reported for the elderly, however many of these risk factors are not applicable to persons with a spinal cord injury, who use a wheelchair for mobility. The objectives of this study are to: (1) describe the incidence and prevalence of tips, falls, and fall-related injuries in SCI; (2) describe the epidemiology of the fall event (person, time, place, and activity); (3) describe any injuries associated with a fall, including the mechanism and nature of the injury, severity of injury, as well as treatment required; (4) determine the risk factors related to falls and fall-related injuries in SCI, and develop a model for predicting falls and fall-related injuries in SCI; (5) determine healthcare utilization as well as direct and indirect costs associated with fall-related injuries in SCI; and (6) describe patient-perceived short- and long-term consequences of falls in SCI. The data collection for this study was completed on March 31, 2007, and data analysis is in final phase.  Objectives: The objectives of the study are to describe: (1) the incidence and prevalence of wheelchair tips, falls, and fall-related injuries; (2) epidemiology of event; (3) injuries associated with event, including mechanism, nature, severity of injury and treatment required; (4) determine risk factors and develop a model for predicting tips and falls; (5) determine healthcare utilization and direct and indirect costs; and (6) describe perceived short- and long-term consequences of falls in SCI.  Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. Data was collected through patient surveys, medical records, and VA databases. Baseline information includes risk factors (e.g., user characteristics, wheelchair features, wheelchair activities, etc.) and physical environmental data. Monthly follow-up calls tracked tips, falls, and injuries.  Status: Recruitment ended on April 1, 2006 with a total of 702 subjects, and data collection was completed on March 31, 2007. The Data Safety Monitoring Board for this study conducted its final meeting on September 17, 2007. Data has been analyzed and 17 manuscripts are currently in development.  Impact: While much is known about falls in elderly, there is a lack of understanding of the epidemiology of wheelchair-related falls. Our project is expected to identify previously unaccounted for factors that predispose persons with SCI to falls and fall-related injuries. This study will result in the creation of a model for predicting falls and fall-related injuries in SCI. The predictive model will be used to develop intervention strategies targeting modifiable risk factors. Eventually, we will test this predictive model with other vulnerable veteran populations. Findings from this study wil be used to develop an instrument to identify fall risk in persons with SCI.

Effects of Multimodal Analgesia on Serum MCP-1, BDNF, and MiRNA-124 in Hysterectomy Surgery The inflammatory process is the main mechanism in the occurrence of acute postoperative pain. It is also the main risk for the development of acute pain into persistent pain. Inflammation occurs in the process of peripheral sensitization and central sensitization with various inflammatory mediators. Postoperatively, there will be proliferation and activation of microglia and astrocytes which will then activate inflammatory receptors and signaling cascades of neurotransmitters, cytokines, and chemokines. There has been a lot of clinical research evidence that multimodal analgesia can adequately treat acute pain and can prevent the development of acute postoperative pain into persistent pain and chronic postoperative pain, but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.

Severe Chronic Respiratory Failure and Citrulline Because of its very high bioavailability and its specific and direct action on protein synthesis, the investigators hypothesize that citrulline supplementation would be an innovative nutritional strategy to improve the peripheral muscle mass and strength in COPD patients with severe chronic respiratory failure.  This supplementation would be more effective if the pathology is severe and the chronic systemic inflammation important. The benefits of this supplementation could help the most severe patients break out of the cycle of inactivity and thus optimize their quality of life.  The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of 45-day nutritional supplementation with Citrulline (10 g / day) on the body composition (lean body mass) in malnourished COPD patients with severe chronic respiratory failure.

Global CMR Registry The Global CMR Registry aims to promote collaboration of CMR sites worldwide in setting imaging and reporting standards, assessing its diagnostic impact on patient care, and determining the cost-effectiveness of CMR imaging. It will be the largest collective body of evidence reflecting the current clinical applications in patient care, which healthcare payers and governing bodies alike can depend on when metrics such as testing appropriateness, common indications, and diagnostic effectiveness are called for. It will also be able to reflect any changes in patient impact from CMR over time as technical development evolves. Furthermore, it will allow an assessment of improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic thinking, risk stratification, and cost-effectiveness relevant to current patient management.

Dual Task During Resistance Training in CTR Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a highly prevalent peripheral compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity. CTS is characterised by the presence of pain, tingling sensations and paraesthesia in the median nerve territory. Symptom severity and pain are commonly modulated by psychosocial factors (e.g. catastrophic thinking and kinesiophobia).  The objective of this study will be (1) to evaluate the effect of dual-task on the maximum number of repetitions possible and pain during rubber band training in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome undergoing surgery; (2) to determine the influence of psychosocial factors on the response to dual-task exercise.  Patients will voluntarily participate in the study, which will be conducted at the Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, during the months of November 2022 to December 2022. All participants will be informed of the aims and content of the research and written informed consent will be obtained. The study will conform to the Declaration of Helsinki and will be approved by the local ethics committee.  The experimental protocol begins with the assessment of self-perceived pain intensity and perceived exertion when using different intensities of elastic resistance, during wrist flexion and extension, at a controlled speed of 1.5sec/ phase. To assess the intensity at which they will work, participants will perform 2 repetitions and will be allowed a rest of 60s between sets until they obtain a score of 3 on the Borg CR10 scale. For this purpose, 1.5 m long elastic bands, pre-stretched to approximately 25% of their initial length, in yellow, red, green, blue, black, silver and gold (TheraBand CLX, The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA), will be progressively used starting from the lowest available elastic resistance (i.e. yellow). This intensity is selected because it appears to correspond to a resistance equivalent to 30% of 1RM and is considered a light intensity. Exercises should be performed with the subject's available ROM. Participants are asked to move their body and trunk as little as possible and to perform the exercise smoothly, without stopping or accelerating. The exercise will be performed in a seated position, with the back supported by the backrest and the forearm resting on a table, with the shoulders and elbows bent at 90 grades, leaving the wrist free, with the elastic bands held under the feet (stepping on them).  During the week of familiarisation and analysis of acute effects, subjects will attend 2 sessions, separated by 2 rest days in between, where they will perform 2 conditions/session (4 conditions in total at the end of the study), in a counterbalanced manner, with 10 minutes rest between each condition: 1) perform the highest number of wrist flexion repetitions with the appropriate resistance; 2) perform the highest number of wrist flexion repetitions with the appropriate band, and following a dual task; 3) perform the highest number of wrist extension repetitions with the appropriate band; 4) perform the highest number of wrist extension repetitions with the appropriate band, and following a dual task.  The dual task will be self-regulated and will consist of subtracting 3 by 3 from 100, and performing the maximum number of repetitions possible. The subject will perform the mathematical operation aloud, without being corrected, but if they get stuck on a number or operation, they will have to be told to continue subtracting from that number or from another, so that they do not stop performing the operations. At the end of each condition, the subject will be asked about the perceived difficulty of the self-regulated mathematical task (where 0 is not difficult at all and 10 is the maximum difficulty), and the maximum number of repetitions performed will be recorded. The pressure points and VAS will then be measured again.  After the familiarisation week and the analysis of acute effects, subjects will be randomly distributed into two conditions: 1) exercise with dual task; 2) exercise without dual task. The exercises performed will be the same as during the familiarisation week, as well as the guidelines for performing them. Each condition shall be evaluated with a time-out (Crossover design).

Bevacizumab, Docetaxel, and Carboplatin in Treating Women With Stage II or Stage III Breast Cancer RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with docetaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.  PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with docetaxel and carboplatin works in treating women with operable Stage II or stage III breast cancer.

The MATRIX OCT Substudy Residual thrombosis of stent struts may occur after the end of primary angioplasty and determine distal embolization and further myocardial damage. Bivalirudin is considered the most appropriate antithrombotic drug in the setting of primary PCI, but an initial increase in stent thrombosis has been reported. In order to overcome this potential adverse event, a prolonged infusion of bivalirudin after the end of PCI has been proposed.  This aim of this study is to test whether the use of long-term bivalirudin infusion, as compared to the intra-procedural only administration, reduces residual thrombosis of stent struts evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at the end of primary PCI and at 3-5 days follow-up.  A subgroup of patients enrolled in the MATRIX (Minimizing Adverse haemmhorragic events by TRansradial access site and AngioX study) study will be selected showing the following inclusion criteria:  * patients affected by STEMI undergoing primary PCI with stent implantation and randomised to bivalirudin treatment, * patients who, in addition to the infarct related lesion, show at least one critical stenosis of other coronary vessels suitable for staged-PCI, * patients whose anatomy is suitable for OCT evaluation.

After the vaccines, subjects will be randomized to either receive a boost of high dose IFN or no boost. IFN will be administered intravenously (into a vein) for 5 consecutive days (Monday through Friday) every week for 4 weeks. Administration will begin approximately 30 days (± 7 days) after the 3rd vaccine. The first dose of IFNα2b may begin within 10 business days of randomization. All subsequent procedure dates for Group A will be based on the date of the first dose of IFNα2b.
Mixed Methods Evaluation of a Novel Apnoea Event Detection Monitor This investigation is looking at a currently available technology to see if it could have another use i.e. in helping to diagnose patients with sleep apnoea.  With 2-4% of the population suffering from this disease, and the current wait time for a test at approximately 20 weeks, it is hoped that a simple screening method could help speed up the process of finding these patients and getting them on treatment faster.  The current standard of care test involves a sleep study in the patients own home with a device with multiple parts and wires. The RespiraSense Sleep Screener is completely cableless and consists of one small, discrete unit attached to the patients side and a mobile device plugged in by the bed.  Patients at Queen Alexandra Hospital who are prescribed sleep studies will be invited to participate. The RespiraSense Sleep Screener data is only for comparison purposes and will have no effect on their clinical care.  If patients agree to participate they will undergo the sleep study with both devices in the same night and may be followed up with over the phone on their experiences with the test.
Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of OCU410ST for Stargardt Disease This is a Phase 1/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of OCU410ST for Stargardt Disease.  This is a multicenter study, which will be conducted in two phases and will enroll up to a total of 42 subjects.
The Visualization of Uncertainty in Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning for Pulmonary Embolism Medical reasoning is a form of inquiry that examines the thought processes involved in making medical decisions. When physicians are faced with patients' symptoms or signs, their thought processes follow either direct shortcuts to suspect a diagnosis or go into a deeper and more analytic process to reach a diagnosis. The second pathway is less prone to biases and errors. This study explores whether the use of an interactive visual display of probabilities of pulmonary embolism generated from positive or negative test results will increase the adherence to evidence based guidelines in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

Distribution of Risk Factors for Venous Thromboembolism in Blood Donors Venous thromboembolism occurs with an incidence of about 1 per 1000 per year in adults . The main consequences are death, recurrence, post-thrombotic syndrome and major bleeding due to anticoagulation. Mortality rates are lower among patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis and higher among those in whom thrombosis occurs in the presence of cancer.  The risk increases with the age for unclear reasons. There are also differences in the incidence according to ethnicity; however, data in subjects of European ancestry are scarce.  Several studies have documented an association between thrombosis and ABO group. Specifically, non-O blood groups have a higher risk of myocardial infarction, angina, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral ischemia and venous thromboembolism than O. While there are numerous studies carried out in patients who have already shown thromboembolic events, data on the incidence of risk factors in the healthy population are completely inadequate.  Understanding the risk factors for venous thrombosis is necessary to maximize the prevention of this disease in individuals and groups of high-risk patients . For this purpose a self-administered questionnaire will be used. Data obtained by blood donors on exposure to risk factors will be used to set up a clinical score to validate in future studies to carry out in patients with VTE.

Immediate Effects of PNF With Lower Leg Kinesio Taping in Chronic Stroke The aim of this research is to find the immediate effects of propriocepticve neuromuscular facilitation with lower leg kinesiotaping on ankle dorsiflexion, gait and functional mobility in patients with chronic stroke. It will be a randomized clinical trial in which participants will be selected through non probability convenience sampling. Patients aged range from 40 to 70 years, both gender, diagnosed with hemiplegia due to hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke for more than 6 months, with insufficient ankle dorsi flexion less than 8 degree will be included in this study whereas patients with neurological problems other than stroke that would interfere with gait and balance control and with limbs affected bilaterally will be excluded from study. Participant will be randomly allocated into three groups (A,B and C). Group A will receive only ankle kinesiotaping that will be applied for 30 minutes for one session. Group B will receive proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation hold-relax technique in flexion-adduction-external rotation pattern, 15-20 repetitions that will be applied in lying position for 10-15 minutes for one session.  Group C will receive both proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation hold-relax technique with ankle kinesiotaping. Posttest measurement will be taken after 30 minutes of one session of treatment using Time up and GO (TUG) test, dynamic gait index, barthel index and Motor Assessment Scale . Data will be analyzed by SPSS version 21
Positron Emission Tomography to Measure Pain and Pain Control This study will examine how the brain processes pain signals and how the different parts of the brain work with each other in response to painful stimuli. A better understanding of how people experience pain may be helpful in developing more effective treatments.  Healthy normal volunteers, patients requiring third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction, and patients with persistent pain due to disease, injury or other reason may be eligible for this study.  Participants will receive one or more of the following sensory stimuli, which may cause brief discomfort or pain:  * Heat/Cold - applied by an electronically controlled device that touches the skin, or by temperature-controlled water baths, or by a thermally controlled brass cylinder the subject grasps * Capsaicin (active ingredient in hot chili peppers) - injected in a small volume of fluid under the skin or into a muscle * Mechanical stimulation - brushings or vibrations that do not normally cause pain * Ischemic stimulation - inflation of a blood pressure cuff on the arm or leg for up to 30 minutes  These stimuli will be applied both before and during positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. This test shows which parts of the brain are active and which are not and is important for studying how different parts of the brain work together to feel and react to specific sensations. For this procedure, the subject lies on a table in the PET scanner while a series of scans are taken during different sensory conditions. At the beginning of each scan, radioactive water is injected into an arm vein through a catheter (a thin plastic tube). A special camera records the arrival and disappearance of the radiation in various brain areas, creating a picture of the brain's activity in various regions. Oral surgery patients may have PET scans both before and after their wisdom tooth extraction. Alfentanil, a commonly used narcotic pain reliever, will also be given during the PET procedure to determine how the brain responds to sensory stimuli while under the effects of a pain killer.  Participants will also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to help interpret the PET results. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a table in a cylindrical machine (the scanner). He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system.  Some sensory studies may require placing an arterial and/or intravenous line. Following injection of a local anesthetic, a catheter is placed in an artery in the arm. At regular intervals during various sensory stimuli, small blood samples are drawn from the artery to measure blood gases and other substances. Samples may also be drawn from a catheter placed in a vein.  Subjects may also have ultrasound monitoring to evaluate blood flow in the arteries, veins and brain. A gel is spread over the skin above the blood vessel and a hand-foot-and-mouth device is placed on the gel. The device emits high-frequency sound waves to produce a picture of the speed of blood flow in the artery and the diameter of the vessel.

Grape Seed Extract VS Low Level Laser Therapy for Dentin Hypersensitivity Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is a common clinical problem frequently seen in dental patients. According to Splieth et al., the prevalence of dentin hypersensitivity is 3-98% in adult population.DH is described as a short, sharp pain or discomfort that responses to certain stimuli, typically thermal, tactile, osmotic or chemical, due to exposed dentinal surface which can be explained by the hydrodynamic theory.  The laser is a narrow, focused beam of light emitted to vaporise, fuse, melt, or seal dentinal tubules using laser heat to induce hydroxyapatite crystals for recrystallisation of the mineral component of dentine. The obliteration of dentinal tubules is caused by heat generated by laser beam which inhibits the transmission of the stimulus in the dentinal tubules.  Grape seed extract contains proanthocyanidins (PA) which is able to bind to proline-rich proteins, like collagen, and contributes in enzyme proline hydroxylase activity that is essential for the biosynthesis of collagen in the dentin. The cross-linking action of collagen fibrils in dentin also able to prevent mineral loss.
Mechanisms of Gulf War Illness Many veterans with Gulf War Illness developed chronic gastrointestinal symptoms during their deployment to the Persian Gulf. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of these chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are not well understood but cause significant morbidity in veterans. Our proposed studies will provide an innovative and novel treatment trial for chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in veterans with Gulf War Illness that were deployed into war zones. Given that there are currently no specific treatments for these disorders, and that current symptomatic approaches are far from ideal, proof of principle of our trial would be an extremely important advance as it would not only have a beneficial impact on the health of many thousands of our veterans, but also it would substantially reduce the many negative economic effects of this ailment on the VA Health Care System.

Adverse Effects of Red Blood Cell Transfusions: A Unifying Hypothesis (Aim 3) Transfusion of red blood cells is often used in critically ill patients with low red blood cell counts to prevent disease progression and death. Recent studies suggest that the use of "aged" versus "fresh" red blood cells are associated with worse clinical outcomes. There is evidence that red blood cells work with the cells lining our blood vessels to produce a variety of substances that normally cause arteries to relax and increase blood supply. Two of these substances are called nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). The investigators are trying to determine the nature of these substances in human beings when they are transfused "aged" versus "fresh" red blood cells. The purpose of the study is to test the effects of transfusing "aged" versus "fresh" red blood cells in volunteers with traditional cardiovascular risk factors (high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and tobacco use) on 1) the degree of relaxation in the arteries and subsequent changes in blood flow, 2) blood levels of oxidant molecules, 3) inflammation, and 4) stem cells.  A similar study with healthy volunteers are further described in NCT00838331.

Lenalidomide With or Without Rituximab After Standard Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide is more effective with or without rituximab in treating diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying lenalidomide to see how well it works when given with or without rituximab after standard chemotherapy in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

New Method for Real-time Detection of Tissue Ischemia This is a prospective, single arm, open, single centre clinical investigation designed to examine the feasibility and safety of the IscAlert™ device in patients scheduled for limb (arm/leg) surgery with tourniquet. IscAlert is measuring carbon dioxide in muscular and subcutaneous tissue. IscAlert is inserted into normal muscle and subcutaneous tissue in ischemic (operated limb with a tourniquet) and non-ischemic limb (non-operated limb).After the tourniquet is inflated, ischemia develops in the muscles and subcutaneous tissue. This will result in an increase in carbon dioxide, which will be detected by the sensor on the operated extremity, while the sensor on the non-operated will show normal values. After releasing the tourniquet cuff, the muscle will be reperfused and the carbon dioxide level is expected to decrease into normal levels. 50 number of patients will be enrolled to undergo the procedures. The IscAlert will be removed from the patient before the patient is discharged from the operating room, but in 25 of the patients, IscAlert™ will be inserted for 72 hours in the operated extremity after the end of surgery. After this, the sensors are removed.250 Devices is planned to be used in this clinical study.

Clinical Outcomes of Small-incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) Using Vector Planning Method. In the past two decades, the femtosecond laser (FSL) technology has been introduced in the corneal refractive surgery filed, and brought a remarkable innovation. It can make tissue dissection through photodisruption and plasma cavitation. Initially, the FSL was used predominantly to make a corneal flap when performing laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), which is followed by stromal ablation using excimer laser. A new surgical technique called femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx) has been developed that uses only FSL to dissect two interfaces to create refractive lenticule and then remove it, which is very similar with LASIK. Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) which is the advanced form of all-in-one FSL refractive technique does not make a corneal flap rather make small incision where the separated refractive lenticule is removed through, and the upper part of the corneal tissue is called cap. Since the clinical outcomes of SMILE were firstly published in 2011, SMILE has been widely used for correction of myopia or myopic astigmatism worldwide. SMILE provides excellent visual outcomes and has advantages including a lesser decrease in corneal sensitivity and absence of flap related complications compared to LASIK.  The vector planning method is newly developed astigmatism correction method, which combines refraction astigmatism in 60 % emphasis and corneal astigmatism in 40 % emphasis. The vectorial difference between corneal astigmatism and refractive cylinder at the corneal plane is ocular residual astigmatism (ORA). In normal eyes treated for myopic astigmatism, the ORA typically ranges from 0.73 to 0.81 D. The eyes with high ORA resulted in inferior clinical outcomes after corneal refractive surgery including LASIK, LASEK, and SMILE. The vector planning method was effective in LASIK according to previous study. Therefore we try to confirm the efficacy of vector planning method in SMILE.

Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Midline Venous Catheters Central venous catheters are fundamental tools in medical practice, but their use carries frequent local and systemic complications, with bloodstream infection (bacteremia) and thrombus formation being the most frequent and serious. Both complications prolong hospitalization time, increase morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. Medium access peripheral venous catheters (MC) are a low-cost, easy-to-place, and highly-durable option that offers greater patient comfort and less pain, among other advantages. The objective of this study is to determine if the implementation of a team specialized in the placement of midline (CM) catheters reduces the incidence of infections associated with central venous catheters, decreases the cost of hospitalization, and preserves venous capital in patients admitted to ICU.
Antidepressants and Bone Mineral Density The aim of this five arm randomized trial was thus to compare selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)sertraline and citalopram to a dual reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, a nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine and a control group receiving placebo, with the primary endpoint being bone mineral density, and secondary endpoints being bone turnover markers.
A Pharmacy-based Observational Study to Learn More About Iberogast Advance in the Real-world Setting This is an observational study in which data from people with functional gastrointestinal disorders who decide on their own or by recommendation of their doctors or pharmacists to take Iberogast Advance are collected and studied. In observational studies, only observations are made without specified advice or interventions.  Functional stomach and bowel (or gastrointestinal) disorders are conditions in which the functionality of the gut, mainly the gut muscles or the gut/brain axis, is disturbed. Functional stomach and bowel disorders cause symptoms like heartburn, cramps and pain of the upper and middle part of the belly, also known as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS affects predominantly the lower digestive system and causes symptoms like pain of the belly, cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.  Iberogast Advance is already available in German pharmacies without prescription for patients with gastrointestinal disorders such as FD and IBS. It contains herb extracts that work against inflammation, are calming, and protect the mucosa (innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract). Earlier controlled studies with Iberogast Advance have shown how well it works and how it affects the body. Since Iberogast Advance is only available since October 2020, there is no information on its use in the real-world setting yet.  Therefore, the study researchers want to collect data on the use of Iberogast Advance in the real-world setting.  To do this, people with long-term and repeated functional gastrointestinal symptoms who purchase Iberogast Advance from participating pharmacies across Germany will be asked to fill out a questionnaire optionally covering 6 weeks of treatment. The participants will take Iberogast Advance as recommended in the product information.  The main purpose of this study is to see how well Iberogast Advance works and is perceived in the real-world setting. Participants will record how they experience a change of their gastrointestinal symptoms (assessed single-symptom-based) from start and during 6 weeks of treatment. Researchers will then compare the differences and analyze treatment effects.  The researchers will additionally collect information on usage behavior, characteristics of the patients, their symptoms, tolerability and their satisfaction with Iberogast Advance.  There will be no required tests or visits with a study doctor in this study. The researchers will collect the results of the patient questionnaires from Jun 2022 to January 2023.
Comparison of the Analgesic Effects of Dronabinol and Smoked Marijuana in Daily Marijuana Smokers The following study is designed to determine the analgesic efficacy of smoked marijuana (0, 1.98, and 3.56% THC) and oral THC (0, 10, and 20 mg) in the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a laboratory model of pain which has predictive validity for clinical use of analgesics. Oral THC (dronabinol) is known to have a slower onset and longer duration of action compared with smoked marijuana. Therefore, the analgesic effects of oral THC is expected to peak later and last longer than effects produced by smoked marijuana.
The Effectiveness of Hyperpure Chlorine Dioxide and Sodium Hypochlorite Irrigants in Endodontic Retreament in RCT Endodontic treatment aims to eliminate pathogenic microbes from the root canal. Hyperpure chlorine dioxide is an endodontic irrigant. Our goal is to compare the efficacy of hyperpure chlorine dioxide with the gold standard sodium hypochlorite in the non-surgical retreatment of root canal treated teeth with chronic periapical lesions in a randomized clinical trial. Forty patients having chronic apical periodontitis will randomly be chosen for the study from the patients attending our Department of Conservative Dentistry. Endodontic treatment will be done according to professional quidelines. The patients will randomly be divided into two groups. In the first (control) group sodium hypochlorite, in the second group hyperpure chlorine dioxide will be used as desinfectant. The first sample will be taken from the root canal after removing the previous root canal obturation prior to desinfection. The second sample will be taken one week after temporization. The samples will be evaluated by culturing, MALDI-ToF and PCR strip test. After root canal obturation the the periapical status will be followed by clinical evaluation and control x-rays.

An Intervention for Female Breast CANcer: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (I-CAN-ACT) for Depression and Physical Pain As a result of the cancer diagnosis and medical therapies, women with breast cancer often encounter debilitating cooccurring psychological and physical symptoms. While pain constitutes one of the most common adverse physical side effects of medical treatment reported by breast cancer patients, the most prevalent psychological symptom they seek psychological help for is depressive symptoms. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in psychosocial oncology care may be particularly beneficial in targeting depression and cancer-related pain. The aim of the I-CAN-ACT project is to examine in a RCT the efficacy of a brief ACT-based intervention for both depression and physical pain (6 online sessions) compared to a waitlist control on various outcomes in women with breast cancer. Outcomes will include quality of life, physical pain intensity and interference, depression, and anxiety in women with breast cancer. These will be assessed at post-treatment and at the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1 year follow-ups (for Marianna Zacharia's PhD thesis, results will be presented until the 3-month follow-up). Also, the Acceptability and Feasibility of the intervention will be assessed. That is, participants' treatment acceptability and adherence to the brief ACT intervention in terms of retention, treatment engagement and satisfaction with each session and with the overall treatment will be assessed. Participants' reasons for dropout will be recorded.

Assessing Open Access Audio The medical encounter can be overwhelming in term of the amount of information discussed, its technical nature, and the anxiety it can generate. Easy access to a secure audio recording from any internet enabled device is an available low cost technology that allows patients to "revisit the visit" either alone or sharing with caretakers and family. It has been introduced and tested outside the VA with evidence that it increases patient recall and understanding and may even improve physician performance. Little is known, however, about whether and to what extent these effects lead to better outcomes, such as improved treatment plan adherence and chronic disease self-management. This study is a randomized controlled trial designed ascertain whether easy access to audio recordings of the medical visit improves patients perception that they understand and can manage their own care, and leads to a variety of improved outcomes, such as better blood pressure and diabetes control, and fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations.
Cholinesterase Inhibitors to Slow Progression of Visual Hallucinations in Parkinson&Apos;s Disease Rationale: Visual hallucinations (VH) are the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). As an independent predictor for cognitive decline and nursing home placement they form an important disability milestone in the course of PD. According to current clinical guidelines minor VH do not require treatment per se. But as minor VH precede the stage of major VH without insight and PD associated psychosis (PDP) they offer an opportunity for early intervention. Neuroleptic drugs delay the transition into PDP but are unsuitable for early treatment of VH due to their side effects. We hypothesize that cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) are a well-tolerated alternative for the early treatment of minor VH to delay the progression to PDP, and that brain network analysis is suitable to predict treatment response.  Objective: Investigate whether early treatment with ChEI delays the progression of minor VH to major VH without insight or PDP. In addition, we will measure motor control, psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, daytime sleepiness, adverse events and compliance, disability, caregiver burden and care use. We assess the cost-effectiveness of early chronic treatment of VH with ChEI. Finally, we analyse changes of functional brain networks before and during treatment.  Study design: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial with an economic evaluation.  Study population: 168 patients with PD and VH after fulfilling the in-and exclusion criteria.  Intervention: Rivastigmine capsule 6 mg BID or placebo BID for 24 months.  Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is the median time until PD patients with minor VH progress to major VH without insight. The clinical endpoint is defined as the start with antipsychotic treatment. Secondary outcome measures are changes in motor control, psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, mood disorders, daytime sleepiness, cholinergic deficiency, the number of adverse events, compliance, disability and caregiver burden. The median time until PD patients with minor VH progress to PD dementia is measured by means of changes in cognitive function. The secondary neurophysiological outcome measures are peak frequency, functional connectivity, topological network organisation and the direction of information flow. All relevant costs will be measured and valued.  Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The burden of participation consists of a total of 5 clinical visits (every 6 months), 5 telephone interviews on adverse events during the escalation phase and 9 questionnaires on health related costs (every 3 months). In a subgroup 3 additional visits for EEG recording are needed. There is a risk for adverse reactions with rivastigmine treatment; the most common are nausea and vomiting.
Predictors of Coronary Revascularization Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome * To explore the metabolic outcomes of PCI versus CABG in diabetic patients presented by ACS. * To verify the diagnostic and prognostic value of speckle tracking echocardiography in early detection of MACE after ACS in diabetic patients treated by 2 modalities.
Subjective Image Quality in Stereoscopic Image Modifications Humans attain binocular vision from the two retinal images of both eyes through a series of sensory and motor processes that culminate in the perception of stereoscopic depth. Looking at a scene creates two slightly different images on the retinas which is due to the eyes' different positions on the head. This so called binocular disparity provides information to calculate depth and therefore enables stereopsis. Physiologically the two retinal images are superimposed and merge into one stereoscopic image.  If one image is presented to one eye in an experimental setting, and a completely different image is presented to the other eye, the investigators visual system, analogous to diplopic vision, is not able to fuse these image stimuli. Instead, a phenomenon called binocular rivalry occurs. Here, both images are seen alternating and the brain can switch back and forth between these images.  The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of objective changes to image quality on the investigators subjective stereoscopic perception. This psychophysiological testing is done by looking at different images and thereafter by subjective grading of the image quality.  The investigators hypothesize that overlapping image modifications occurring in both eyes are detected immediately, but changes, that are rotated by 90 degrees against each other, should be suppressed and result in one stereoscopic image, reduced in image quality. Whether this also accounts for more detailed images, such as reading cards, is questionable.
The Effect of Coenzyme Q10 on Hearing and Tinnitus Characteristics of Chronic Tinnitus Patients The study is a randomised double-blinded trial. A group of 40 tinnitus patients with a naturally low Q10 level will be selected out of a preselected group of 160 screened out of a pre-existed database or patients which visited the ENT-consultation. The 40 patients with the lowest level will be asked to take 2 months Q10 (n=20) or the placebo (n=20). To evaluate the effect on hearing and tinnitus characteristic; audiometric test, tinnitus analysis and auditory evoked responses will be used as outcome measurements.
Genetic and Dietary Predictors of Anti-platelet Response This study will investigate differences in platelet aggregation under basal and aspirin-treated conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native people who have extreme levels (low and high) of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA) in red blood cell membranes. The study will also determine whether or not platelet aggregation under the different conditions is modified by CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1, and ACTN1 gene variation.
Nurse-led Placement of Peripheral Venous Catheters in Overweight Patients Using Standard or Dynamic Ultrasound-guided Technique Overweight and obesity may be associated with difficult intravenous access leading to longer procedure time and more placement attempts of peripheral venous catheters (PVC). Dynamic ultrasound-guided short-axis needle tip navigation (DUST) may facilitate the procedure.  This was a prospective, randomized, non-blinded study to compare time and placement attempts for nurse-led standard (ST) and ultrasound guided PVC placement in 90 emergency patients with a BMI ≥25kg/m2.  Consenting patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive PVC by either ST or DUST.  Application time was defined as the time from applying stasis to visible blood in the PVC flash-chamber.  No difference in time was found (medians: ST 42 s; DUST 53.5 s, P = 0.535). There were on average 17 % less placement attempts in the DUST-group (median 1 attempt; Q1 = 1 Q3 = 1) compared to the ST-group (median 1 attempt; Q1 = 1 Q3 = 1.5), (p = 0.031). Patients reported no differences in perceived pain (p = 0.955) or perceived satisfaction (p = 0.342). Pain and subcutaneous infiltrations were the only side-effects reported (ST-group 6, DUST-group 5).  DUST does not decrease time to functional PVC but reduces the number of PVC placement attempts in patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2.
Pilot-study: Non-thermal Ablation Using Irreversible Electroporation to Treat Colorectal Liver Metastases Irreversible electroporation is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment to treat tumors near or around vulnerable structures, such as central liver tumors.  To investigate the safety and efficacy of IRE in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases, patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases undergo IRE and resection of the metastases in the same session. After resection, the specimen is examined macroscopically to determine vitality using a specific vitality staining (triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride) and to visualize the exact ablation zone. Subsequently, histopathologic examination is used to determine type of cell death and the microscopic ablation zone.  The investigators hypothesize that IRE is a safe effective method to treat colorectal liver metastasis and that cell damage and cell death is demonstrated as soon as 1 hour after the procedure.

Low vs. Standard Daily Doses of Antiepileptic Drugs in Newly Diagnosed, Previously Untreated Epilepsy(STANDLOW) There are no guidelines on the first maintenance daily dose of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in newly diagnosed, previously untreated epilepsy. Original trials and Cochrane reviews show that seizure remission can be achieved with differing daily doses. In clinical practice, the first maintenance dose varies significantly. In contrast, the risk of adverse treatment effects increases with dosage. There is thus the need to identify the lowest effective dose for treatment start. This background prompted us to undertake a randomized multicenter pragmatic non-inferiority trial comparing standard to low daily doses of AEDs to demonstrate that low doses are at least as effective as standard doses (as indicated by the national formulary) but are better tolerated and are associated with a better quality of life. If proven as effective as the standard dose, a low daily dose of AEDs is a benefit to the patient in terms of tolerability and safety and a source of savings for the National Health System.
Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one drug and giving them before and with radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for limited-stage small cell lung cancer.  PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in treating patients who have limited-stage small cell lung cancer.
Impact of Rituximab (RTx) Induction and Living Donation on Immunoregulation and Virus Control in Renal Transplantation This project comprises immunological and virological analyses within a prospective clinical study of Rituximab (Rtx)-treated blood group incompatible living donor (LD) renal transplant recipients compared to blood group compatible LD recipients without Rtx induction, and of living donor compared to deceased donor renal transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus (Tacr)/mycophenolate sodium (MPS). Aim of this project is to assess short- and long-term effects of immunosuppressive therapy (Rtx induction) and of living donation on immunological and histological parameters of graft outcome and on viral replication (BK virus (BKV), JC virus (JCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV)) with the potential to improve long-term graft outcome and to enable risk estimation of virus disease.

The Value of the Canadian CT Head Rule and the New Orleans Criteria in Minor Head Trauma The New Orleans Criteria (NOC) and the Canadian CT Head Rules (CCHR) have been developed to decrease the number of normal computed tomography (CT) in mild head injury (MHI). The aim is to compare the clinical performance of these 2 decision rules for indentifying patients with intracranial traumatic lesions and those who required an emergent neurosurgical intervention following MHI.
Preterm Arginine INTake Study The investigators will explore the effect of current intravenous feeding (parenteral nutrition (PN)) formulations on blood arginine levels and the genes that are involved in body nutrition and fighting infection in premature babies. They will also investigate the effect of supplementing arginine on these genes. The investigators will undertake a single centre exploratory physiological study in 12 very premature infants receiving PN. 4 of these infants will be supplemented with arginine. The investigators will record nutritional intake and routine biochemical testing data (which includes amino acid levels) collected over the first 10 days of life. They will take blood for analysis at prespecified intervals for microarray, ammonia and IGF-1 levels. Microarray findings will allow the investigators to describe the effect of arginine on gene activity in preterm infants.

Being Awake, Upright and Moving as the Basis for Early ICU Physiotherapy Patients who have been admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU) and are intubated and mechanically ventilated for longer than 48 hours have impaired physical, psychological and social health and well-being six to twelve months after discharge. The advocacy of intensive physiotherapy and mobilization early in the course of critical illness has been established. It is of great importance to study the long-term outcomes (physical function and quality of life) in intubated and ventilated patients who start exercising and ambulating mobilizing) as soon as possible during ICU stay because the most effective mode, intensity or frequency of exercise needs to be identified.  The aim is to study the short- and long-term outcomes of enhanced early physiotherapy and upright position in critically ill patients on prolonged invasive ventilation and to develop principles to guide physiotherapists in their clinical decision making in the ICU.

The Effects of Transcutaneous Occipital Nerve Stimulation and Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization on Patients With Chronic Migraine In this study, it was aimed to examine the effects of two different treatments applied to the neck region, which have been popular in recent years, on migraine.The study included 45 female patients aged 20-50 years with migraine complaints. The patients were divided into 3 randomized groups: control group (n=15), Instrument-Assisted Soft tissue Mobilization (EDYDM) group (n=15) and on Occipital nerve TENS (OTES) group(n=15).Each group was given home exercise to their treatment. Home exercises applied 1 time per day for 5 weeks. Each exercise in the exercise program was performed with 10 repetitions
BrUOG 397: NEO Rad (LOW): Neoadjuvant Low Dose Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy, Ipilimumab and Nivolumab This single-arm phase 2 study will enroll patients with resectable and operable stage IB - III non-small cell lung cancer and treat them with pre-operative ipilimumab + nivolumab plus low-dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered concurrently. Only patients who proceed to surgery will be evaluable for the primary endpoint. The primary efficacy outcome measurement will be pathologic response (including Major Pathologic Response (MPR), and Complete Pathologic Response (CPR)). Secondary outcome measures include safety, and exploratory biomarkers of immune response in pre- and post-operative blood and tissue. A two-stage design will stop the study if fewer than 3 of the first 9 evaluable patients do not achieve MPR. An early stopping rule for safety will stop the study if more than 12 patients are enrolled to find the first 9 evaluable patients.
A Study in People With Normal Kidney Function and People With Reduced Kidney Function to Test How BI 764198 is Processed in the Body The main objective of this trial is to investigate the influence of moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of BI 764198 in comparison to a group of matched controls with normal renal function.
Post-Stroke Osteopathy The sudden biomechanical inactivation, direct neuro-humoral effects and sustained systemic stress reaction, which commonly occur after stroke or TIA, all may be of relevance in triggering alterations in bone metabolism and remodelling of bone microstructure.  The objectives of this observational pilot study are to characterize falls and fractures and their circumstances (sex and age specific incidence, time course, risk conditions, localization) in ischemic stroke patients, study changes in the bone microstructure after ischemic stroke supported by high-resolution peripheral quantitative Computer Tomography, unravel a molecular mechanisms underlying the increased fracture risk (focus on Wnt-signaling and ß-adrenergic projection), establish risk factors to estimate the risk of falls based on information from gait analysis as well as construct deep learning algorithms to identify bone microstructure parameters for predicting fractures.
Anatomic Reconstruction of the Patellofemoral Joint The investigators posit that it would be advantageous to reproduce the height of the entire patellofemoral joint in order to maintain the lever arm of the quadriceps mechanism at its preoperative level. Failure to do this may cause the quadriceps mechanism to be inefficient. For example the quadriceps mechanism would have to work harder if the total patellofemoral (PF) height is diminished. Alternatively, diminished motion or increased patellar strain may occur if the overall PF height is increased. The investigators theorize that either of these sizing errors could lead to anterior knee pain. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes between two surgical techniques: 1) a technique of reproducing the total PF joint on both sides of the articulation (Group 1) and 2) the traditional technique of reproducing only the patellar thickness on one side of the joint (Group 2).
Human Blood Specimen Collection to Evaluate Immune Cell Function Natural killer (NK) cells are leukocytes of the innate immune system and play a central role in the control of cancer metastases. NK cells and other innate immune cells often do not function well in patients with cancer and are also profoundly suppressed after cancer surgery. Dr. Auer's Lab and others have shown that NK cells are critically important in the clearance of tumor metastases and that their impairment can be recovered with immune therapy augmenting the innate immune system. Several studies suggest that cancer patients have depressed NK cell cytotoxicity as compared to healthy controls but that following resection of the cancer, NK cell cytotoxicity returns to normal levels. In this observational study, the investigators will measure NK cell cytotoxicity by the gold standard method (51Cr, a chromium51 release assay) and by a new interferon-ɣ (IFN-ɣ) based assay (NK-Vue™) in healthy humans and colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery patients seen a The Ottawa Hospital. The results of this study will determine if the NK-Vue™ is able to discriminate between healthy human volunteers and newly diagnosed cancer patients and is sufficiently sensitive to detect transient NK cell suppression immediately following surgery.
